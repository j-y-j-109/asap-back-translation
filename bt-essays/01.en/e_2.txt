I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought about people's veiws on certain technolgy? While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers, and are waisting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can help with homework, interacting with people, and even help us with exercising. You'll find that in the end, computers end up as benefits for everyone. For many students, they need computers to help them understand their subjects. There are certain websights that give online lessons. Along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework. My math teacher, @PERSON2, is always saying,"@CAPS1 into the online sight." I've found that it really helps me when I'm struggling with my work. We can also ask our friends with help if we still @CAPS4't understand. That's not all we can do. There are certain sights like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 where we can interact with other people. You can talk to them when they're out of town and have no cell-phone. You can also tak when the phone is being used and you have something importain to tell them, such as helping them with their homework. When there's no telephone reception between each other, they can still talk over one million people in the @LOCATION1 use these sights. People are wrong when they say it takes their time away from exercising. Many websights give good tips on how to lose weight. The show many dieting plans such as @PERSON3 or @PERSON1. Not only that, but they also have exercise plans. It's not the computer's fault, it's the people who @CAPS4't "stick" with exercising. Also, the computer reccomends many great gyms you can join, like @LOCATION2 fitness. @CAPS4't you think that's a good "deal?" @CAPS4't listen to those other people stick with my opinion that computers are benefits for everyone. They can help us with many things, above and beyond. I can't imagine life without them. Most everyone uses computers! Thank you for reading.

Dear @CAPS1, I disagree with those who support advances in technology, the people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. Would you rather spend your time on the computer rotting like a vegetable or would you rather hang out with your firned, travel to other places that you never thought possive or even go to a gym and probably loose some pounds? I vote hanging out with my friends! You know people that like to travel to far away places and have fun would rather that than waste their time on a computer. As much as people like to look at all the cool places that they check out on the internet; what's the point in just sitting their and watching the screen when you could get a plane ticket and fly to the magical place that you saw on the computer. Ok. I know that traveling to faraway places can be scary because you never been to area in your life, but @CAPS3's worth the try. Ok fine if flying is not your thing then why not thy exercising. @MONTH1 be you have been trying to lose some extra pounds. You could always try that. Think about @CAPS3, my mother was using her so that she could fit into a size @NUM1 and now look she is in a size @NUM1. Why bore yourself to death with computers that will probably give you the wrong advise when you could always ask a friend for advise. Yes a friend a live and breathing human being, losing some weight will help you gain confidence if you just try. @CAPS3's just like @PERSON1, from @CAPS2 lower said, you got to want @CAPS3 if you want to accomplish that goal of yours. Everyone can go for that goal! Maybe you dont want to exercise, maybe you want to hang out with your friends and family. If you waste your time online chatting, how are you oing to chat with the people that are eight in front of you. If you can talk online then you can probably talk to people in real life? Right? Wrong! Some people can and some people cant. I am a very talk person, but I know how to talk on line if. I wanted to so why cant you? That's @CAPS3 the time has come t decide. Do you want to spend your time on or computer or do you want to spend your time in the real world. Get out your chair, turn off the computer get up. Put your wat on and walk outside and do something with yourself. Use you mouth not your hand. Talk to people comunicate with them @CAPS3 is not that hard. Trust me. If I can do @CAPS3 you can do @CAPS3 too! @CAPS3's now or never I choose now and so should you. Dont waste anymore time, go on a trip take a hangout. Just do @CAPS3. Dont run back to that computer. Throw @CAPS3 out you can live without @CAPS3.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, More and more people use commputers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society and I am one of theose people, that does not agree. I disagree, because is your on the computer all day you'll forget bout things. For example, you will forget to exercise, you will forget nature, you will also forget to interact with your friends and family. I promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view. People soend to much time on the computer, and they don't exercise like they should. Exerising is very important, that helps you with . Exercising helps you grow. it makes you stronger. If your on the computer all day then, you'll exercise and develop right. Another reason, I think its such a lead idea is you do not get to enjoy nature. When your on your computer you can not go on an hike in the woods. You can not go on camping trip. You can not do the thing, in the pleasant air of nature. The last reason but defenitly not the least you will forget to interact with your friends and family. That is so important because a computer could do a lot. It could teach you a lot but it canot do it you and @MONTH1 I love you. Only youre family and friends could do that. Hopfully you under and realize my point of view. People should stop doing this you forget to exercise nature and to spend time with you friends and family. All I got to now thank you for the oppurtunity to listen to my idea.
<START>

Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me thats very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ingnore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your soical activitys with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exerise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 back a couple decades ago, before computers existed. What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, @PERSON2 had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. "I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!" @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children's computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people "@CAPS3" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, "I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..." @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person , only through technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I @CAPS6 urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this letter, it means a lot to me, I am writing today because it has come to my attention that some people are saying that computers do not benefit society. Those people are very wrong! Computers are amazing! They allow easier research, I can learn about other countries, and can talk to people online. I do all of this stuff alsmost every day! We're just finishing up a pretty big research assignment for english and social studies. It involved taking a note cards from different sources. Luckily, I was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic, just by typing the keyword! We can narrow down our options so easily because you can search for something so specific. After you find your topic, you can check and see if there's reliable information by reading a summary. All of this can be done in about @NUM1 minutes or less.This would be nearly imposible without a computer. I have a few relative in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. A while back my family and I were trying to plan a trip to @LOCATION2 to visit. We were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport. it gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there. i've also been able to do plenty of research on other foreign countries at the push of a button. it's so simple and convenient, too! My two uncles live in @LOCATION1. On thanksgiving my mother was upset because she missed them I was then able to set them up in a video chatroom so my mom could talk to them. this is great, its so convenient to be to go an instant message. i can talk to people all over the world and it doesn't even any money! In conclusion, computers are very helpul because you can learn about foreign countries, have easy access to research, and can talk online. there's a long list of other things that make computers great, but it would take too long to write. Thank you again for listening.

Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer. Also many people have an email! that tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stors and it saves people money using those cupons. Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the @TIME1. My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where there going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like. they can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are see if its a small school if there are alot of kids that go to that school and etc. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer there. hand eye coordination gets better because when your typing your moving your fingers and your geting the feeling when you use it and your geting faster at typing. Also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain. Scholastic kids states that kids who use the the computer and use the keyboark brings there @CAPS1 up @NUM1 points. in conclusion I dont think that the computer has a bad effect after your done reading thise I hope you agree with me.
<START>

I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise, enjoy nature and interact with family and friends because it is the persons choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers affect peoples lives in good ways and bad ways. People stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons. Good ways is that it educates you in many ways because @CAPS1 your on the computer watching or reading interesting things you could end up learning something before you learn it in school. Its good to go on the computer for a little a bit but @CAPS1 your on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat. But @CAPS1 you go outside sometimes you wont have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body. I think computers are a great way to have fun. You can chat with your friends, @CAPS1 you have a webcam you can video chat with friends. A cmputer is a great way for communication. Millions of people use a computer for working at their @CAPS2. Without computers life would be ten times harder for people in this world. People like accountants use computer for there job. They store data into the computer to remember things @CAPS1 you couldn't write it down on a piece of paper, People also make websites on the internet to help educate, like @CAPS1 you type in a word it could give you a definition, People also make @CAPS4 engines, @CAPS4 engines are some engine on a website that searches for things you type in. @CAPS1 you type in something you will get what you were looking for. My whole point of explaining this is that its the peoples choice @CAPS1 they would like to be on all the time. Because computers and internet connections arn't free. It doesn't even do anything bad to your brain. It mostly educates it. People even go to school online they learn and study on things that are on the internet. Plus you could get @CAPS2 at places for working with computers, You could make programs, and anything you would want. So my statement here is that its okay to spend alot of time on your computer instead of exercizing going to see friends and family and enjoy nature. I think that computers are fine and it doesn't matter how long your on it, it just depends @CAPS1 your learning and not playing games all day and being lazy and get fat.

Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers possitively affecting society? As technology advances, humans are relying on them more and more; most people use them daily. I believe computers effect people possitively because they help write papers, are a social tool, and are a big help with research. After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a possitive effect on people in society. My first reason why computers have a possitive effect on people is they help with writing papers. Whether it is writing a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand. Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is. This helps the people writing the paper because writing takes many drafts to get the piece perfect; it is a pain to write each draft by hand. In additio, it is easier to read someone's writing @CAPS1 its typed, especially @CAPS1 the writer has hand writing. However, computers help in more than just writing papers. My second reason why computers passitively effect people is by being a social tool. Many websites online these days have social networks such as youtube, facebook, twitter, and myspace. In the listed websites above and many others as well, people can meet other people through other friends and games. The nice thing about meeting them online is that you don't have to plan a time to meet the person, @CAPS1 you are both online you guys can begin chatting. The chatting also helps @CAPS1 people have long-distance relationships, whether friends, mates, or family. Online chatting help people stay in-touch with someone they might not see everyday. That is a big help with everyone's social life, keeping then us "the " @CAPS2, online sites like eharmony or match.com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate. This also helps people who are shy get married and start a family. This helps people live happier lives, another possitive effect. Finally, computers possitively effect people by making research much easier. My dad always says "You kids got it easy. @CAPS1 I was growing up, we'd to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers." @CAPS3, its simple. Using the internet and a search engine, all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds. Libraries might not have the most recent books, or someone might've checked out your topic's book. Then what can you do? The internet is also an extremely useful help @CAPS1 the research topic is very specific, if its a certain becteria or species that a book @MONTH1 only briefly mention. The internet has a much broader range of articles, so it is much easier to find information for any topic. With research, taking less time to understand, people can spend more time enjoying the day, like playing outside, than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic. This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society. To conclude, computers have a possitive effect on society, because they help write papers, they are a social tool, and are a big help with research. Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything? Think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites. What about how hours of research are @CAPS3 two clicks away? Computers have changed our lives for the better, and we should appreciate all the do for us.

Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writeing to you today to show how I feel on how computers have an effect on people. Computers have a very strong effect on people. Computers can cost people to gain weight, cost problem to there eyes and you couldn't pay bills. We all know that we all gain weight at some point in our life, and we can lose that weight. But if you on a computer for six hours a day you dont have time to cook a real meal. So what do you do, you eat alot of junk food. Do you really want to be the reason why someone is over weight? Picture yourself looking at bright computer sreen for six hour non-stop. Do you think that your eyes are going to be fine I disagree. When I really tried I cant even keep my eyes open and I'm pretty sure you cant say that your eyes are going to be fine when you just got looking at a bright sreen in the dark. Can you see yourself quiting you just because you say your going to work at home. But you dont do your work, and get fried, now how are you going to pay your bill with no money? Once your power goes out you have noting to do because you got fired all because of you computer. Now what are you going to do with your life? Well that all. I would like to thank you for your time. And I hope you agree with me for my three reasons you can gain weight, eye problem and how are you going to pay your bill?

You are the @NUM1 visitor, click here to get your prize! That is normal thing that will @CAPS4 up on computers, they can give you viruses, and people can get your personal information. That is one reason computers are bad. On top @DATE1 that, "@CAPS1 @DATE1 computers more than @NUM2 kids are obducted each day!" says @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @DATE1 the missing child agency. They get obducted @CAPS1 kids go on @CAPS6 rooms and get themselves into trouble. On another note we rely on computers to much, it not healthy for us. "@CAPS4 up ads cause many problems," says @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 @CAPS5. More than @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people in the world have computers. This was from a world wide poll in @DATE1. More than @PERCENT2 @DATE1 that is kids. When kids are on computers they always click on the @CAPS4 up ads. These ads cause catastropic problems! Peoples computers get viruses, identities get stolen, and credit card information gets found out. Therefore with those things happening you are going to yell at your kids, but you can't blame them they just thought they were going to get a free xbox @NUM3. Now that I have told you about @CAPS4 ups let me tell you about chating. Chating on computer is just a bomb waiting to be set off. "@CAPS6 rooms are the main why. Now that I have told you about chating let me tell you about how people rely on them to much. Instead @DATE1 looking up what a book was about, just read it! Everyone thinks a computer is the answer to every problem when in reality @PERCENT3 @DATE1 the things on the internet are false, says Technology @CAPS7 a magazine that deals with the disadvantages @DATE1 technology. I remember when I needed to know if my flight to @LOCATION1 was cancled, so I went on google and looked it up. The website I went on said it was cancled but later when I called the airport just to make sure it had been they said it took off when it was scheduled to! And instead @DATE1 an e-mail just send a letter! Do you want your kids obducted @CAPS1 fo @CAPS6 rooms? @DATE1 course not, and do you want to miss your flight for vacation? No I dont think so, computers are very bad and are used to often. No one wants their identity stolen @CAPS1 @DATE1 some @CAPS4 up ad. We need to do things on our own more often and stop relying on computers to do everything for us!

Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. It teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society. First off, computers teach hand-eye coordination. For instance if you're in a rush to type an amazing long essay you won't have the time to keep looking back at your paper, the keyboard and the screen. So you would need to know where these handy-dandy keys are. However, if would be a lot more trouble if you didn't have any knowledge about computers are where the helpful keys are. Secondly, people would be able to learn about faraway places. If somebody wanted to take a nice, relaxing vacation/honeymoon with their beautiful wife they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring, and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious, freshest restaurants, hottest stores in this enormous populated city. Without a doubt, I would love to take a vacation, but if it's going to cost a fortune I might have to re-consider this amazing trip. Lastly, you can talk online with other people. On blistering cold days and you can't go outside, or call them because you don't have phone you can myspace or facebook them as long as you want as long as you have a @NUM1 and only email address that nobody else has. Now it's time to decide! Do computers have a positive or negative effect on people. In my opinion computers are great for society and we should keep having them around because they teach hand-eye coordination, and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Best of all, you will be able to talk to your friend and family online. This is certainly a great form of technology people should have.

Dear trained @ORGANIZATION1 reader, @CAPS1! Ah, I love hearing my computer thunk on when I wake up. Such a lovely sound. Some people feel the need to disagree and say computers are bad for people. But, I feel the computer is a magnificent invention. All that @CAPS2 will help improve hand-eye cordination, you can look up anything in the world, and you can even meet new people and keep in touch with faraway friends. The world is just a click away! What's this? You need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills at the same time? No need to worry, you can just type that paper up on the computer! This is one of the many perks of owning a computer. @CAPS2 a paper is so much faster than writing @CAPS3 by hand. Studies show that @CAPS2 a paper is @PERCENT1 faster than writing @CAPS3 out. Even @PERSON1, and handwriting enthusiest, says "@CAPS2 is so much easier than having to write! I type all my books proper handwriting." @CAPS3's been said by officials that most hand-writen lovers are converting to @CAPS2 for better hand-eye cordination. If @CAPS3's used by the people that oppose @CAPS3, @CAPS3's gotta be great! Let's say your doing a project on panda bears, but you don't know anything about them. What do you do? Search @CAPS3 up on @CAPS4.com of course! @CAPS4.com is a bounty of information, serving up marsels of links for any-and every-topic. I remember this one time I had a big report to write but I didn't know anything about the subject. So what solved my problem? @CAPS4! @CAPS3's been proven that @PERCENT2 of information found on @CAPS4 is true. You know what else on the computer can help you with information? Just about any domain name on the web. Just type what your looking for, add .com at the end and @CAPS5! all the information you could need. Hm, what else can the computer help with? I know. Your friend that moved away, you can send her a message and get back in touch. Or, if you don't like your friend that moved away, you can meet new people. For example, @LOCATION1 is a sight designed to match people up for romantic relations. So maybe you don't like computers. Oh well, all I can tell you is that your missing a lot. Great hand-eye cordination, magnificent information, and colorful people like I said, the world is just a click away!

Dear readers many people use computers but, not so many people think @CAPS4 benefits society. Well, I @CAPS5! I think this because the internet helps you connect with people you're looking for. The internet also gives you the advantage to shop online. If you don't have a @CAPS1 system, you ca get directions online. If you read more you will see why I support these details. Have you ever heard of @CAPS2 or @CAPS3? Well incase you haven't @CAPS4's a social networking site, @CAPS4 helps you connect, chat and find people you are looking for. I have a @CAPS2 and a @CAPS3 and they're not that bad. They're actually fun. There is games you can play, quizzes you can take and you can chat with your friends. @CAPS4's a great way to find someone you know in another town or even. This is one reason the computer is a good source. If there is ever a reason you can't drive to store or where ever you need to go to buy something, you can shop online and buy @CAPS4! you can just type in the adress of the website and look at all the stuff they have and click what you want and buy @CAPS4! They even have grocery shopping online. So next time your really upset that you can't go shopping, just shop online. "@CAPS4 might take a while to get your purchase items, @CAPS4's worth the wait." @CAPS5 you have a @CAPS1 system? well if you don't, don't worry! you can go online to a website such as www.mapquest.com. All you have to @CAPS5 is type in the adresss where your starting from and then the adress where your going to. Then you can print out the directions so you won't be lost! Thats deffinatly an advantage! So, don't you think that the computer is a deffinate advantage to almost everyone? Well I @CAPS5! you can use @CAPS4 to find people you need to find. you can shop online and you can easly in less than finve minutes get directions! That's any almost everyone should use a computer.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that two out of three @CAPS2 own a computer? Computers are a very helpful tool that benefit everyone in society. They allow people to communicate with eachother, learn, and teach hand-eye coordination and other good things for school.. Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society. The advance in technology has upgraded computers, and now allows people to communicate through them. For example, new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from you computer screen. This allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch. With my webcam I am able to keep in touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another way of communication is through email. Through the internet, people can type messages back and forth. It is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate. As well as webcams and email computers grants people access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 (instant messaging) or @CAPS4. These websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily. It is not difficult to do, like writing a letter would be, so people can communicate more efficiently and easily. Computers are very helpful for communication along with @CAPS6. Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything. For instace, they could learn about foreigh plaus. All they would have to do is go to the internet, type what they were @CAPS5 for, and it would come up on the screen. It would allow people to learn about places all over the world. Also, people can see pictures on the computer. For example, if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway, they could type in the place and see what it looks like. However, the computer does not just show places. People could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about. Plus, with new websites being created, people could actually see what the earth looks like from space. They can look at houses, the wonders of the world, and much more computers give people the opportunity to learn about so much more. @CAPS6 more would help people, especially students to have a better education. If you ask anyone in school, they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool. Firstly it allows them to type. Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier. It will also look neater and more orginized. Plus, computers teach students hand-eye coordination. By typing or even just clicking the mouse, students are bettering their coordination. This is due to the fast while they are @CAPS5 at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even @CAPS5. Lastly, computers help students because if they need help, they can just ask one of their friends through the computer. Students would better understand the content they are @CAPS6 and when they go to school, they would already know it. Therefore, computers would lead to students getting better grades. Computers play a big role in society today. They are a way of communication, @CAPS6, and allows students to do better in school. Overall, computers are a very beneficial tool in our society.

Dear Newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? @CAPS1 you use facebook, @CAPS2, or any other type of social networking site? Well if you are like the majority of the respectable, caring @CAPS3 in this country you probably answered yes to both of these questions; and you most likely also believe that the computer is a great tool to teach hand-eye coordination, as well as an awesome way to talk with other people online. Not only that but you should notice the great potential the computer has for showing us distant, faraway lands and cultures. What would we be able to @CAPS1 without hand eye cooridination? Nothing that is what we could @CAPS1. Without the hand eye cooridination that computers and video games help you develop, you wouldn't even be able to go outside and enjoy a peaceful game of tennis, baseball, or even basketball all because without hand eye coordination you are clumbsy and your depth perception is off. If it weren't for hand-eye cordination you wouldn't even be able to pick things up because your hands wouldn't go where you eyes were looking. Even though the computer isn't the only way to learn hand eye coordination, it is still an important stragedy that takes no effort to perform. If you are a social butterfly and love to converse with other people then you simply must own a computer! Computers, cell phones, pda's they are all the same, and that's because they are all same form of a computer. When you think about it, our country would be no where without these spectacular devices. These computers helped to industrialize and grow our great superpower of a country. Can you imagine having to drive to people's houses just to talk to them. These machines get our messages and vices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds. They are a great inovation in technolegy. Imagine having a paper for college or an assignment at work due tommorrow, and you have messy handwriting. There is no way you will get it done in time and have it be legible; and worse is that you'll be fired or expelled if it's not done. But your savior has arrived! The computer improves peoples hand writing, speed, and research all at the click of a few buttons. With computers theirs no more need for long tedious hours of handwriting or seaching through books at the library. What would happen to us with out this wonderful invention? The time has come for you to decide for yourself, @CAPS1 you like this time saving, teaching invention that you can socialize on, or would you rather go back to the stone age?

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention that we have created. Some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and hanging with your friends and family. Wait I also agree but spending time on your computer can actually be a good thing. It can be a good thing because you can learn something new every minute, you can also interact with your friends on it, lastly you can do things at the same time hang with your friends and getting exercise. Every minute you are on the computer you can learn something new! For example, let's say that you are on a gaming sights playing a game and suddenly an advertisement appears. It will most likely give you knowledges about the advertisement you are watching. Also study shows that everytime you are on a computer for atleast @NUM1 minutes you can learn something new you spend your . Even way for them to communicate is via internet/computer. This way you can make arrangements. I know that spending too much time on a computer is not all that great, but these are just of the benefits from it so please consider this.

Dear @CAPS1, I beleave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on peope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that atleast @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. Thank you for your time.

Computers and other devices are good for humans especially young people like myself because they are good for communication, keeping the attention of the and providing unknown information. In @CAPS3 letter, I will explain. Communication is key, and technology is close the best and fastest way to use communiocation. Cell phones provide calling usage of course, but they also allow you to text someone. If you have dinner with friends and your late, with text you can send them a message and they should get it in no time at all. Email allows you to do the same as text, but you can write longer messages. Something that's really good for communicating is video chat. If you have a relative that you haven't seen in a long time you can video chat and they can see you and you can see them. It's like talking to one another in person. Keeping a persons attention is critical. Technology does that with games, music from @NUM1's, computers, game systems and the newest way, iPod's and instructions on how to do something. Of course a teacher or parents can do that, but heaving or seeing instructions on a computer is so much more exciting, which brings me back to @CAPS3 topic of keeping a persons attention. Technological devices are more exciting than people teachers and definitely parents but do they offer more? Information is most likiely the most frequent reason in which technology is used. If a child has a project for school, they either use the computers or asks their parents. If the parents have no idea about the question their child just asked, they say, "@CAPS1 it up on the computer", if you havent already done that. So in a way the human race depends on technology, actually we do depend on technology. Computers cellphones, iPods, gamesystems, etc all include a little thing I'd like to call the internet. The internet has been around for a while, going from extremely slow to high-speed, and it is a magical place. It can provide you with directions,recipes, job offers, store locations show times for movies and much , much more. Although technology is used in everyday life from communication to searching for information it can slowly us the human race down. I mean most of us spend most of our time on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when we should be walking around are exercising, looking at the trees and the birds and communicating with family face ti face. Therefore, computers and other things are nice and all, but are the worth getting fat or loosing touch with your loved ones.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology was grown exponetially during the last few years. The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I beleive this is not somthing to be excited about. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. The ove useage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure. Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healty, only use the computer when it's absolutely neccesary. Going on all the time can seperate you from others. This g eneration, adolecents especailly, use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family. Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can became a non-important thing. People can't pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing, even nature. Humans started out living i nthe wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting. Our connection with nature was strong. We needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic "You've got mail." People do not appreciated nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1. com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when neccesary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside.
<START>

I support advances in technology because In the future. Our world will be run by computers people can learn about places and people that they can never afford to see for real, and lastly, this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly. Have you ever thoughtabout the future, I know I have, usually when you think future, you think nobody and lots of automated things. The fact is the world is turning into a pure run by technology and as we the people get smarter, so does the technology so what good will the future if none of us know how to work a simple peice of technology such as a computer, then how are we going to use the more complicated things then? Believe it or not our world within @NUM1 years will be run all on computers, you will not have to do antyihg but wil them. without computers, how would we know aobut all of the stuff that we know now. How would people know that egypt looked like @NUM2 year ago? they dont to be there they could just look it up on the computer and how just as must about it as if they went there. Also computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time. What president that you in something aobut how would you be able to find out after computer you could go to a library is right there to be will out computers in todya society. Our average being would in at how does becaus of the that computers have given us. I can whey some experts are conceried that are however, for some people this is the only correction to their emily and friends it there is a family that lives lets say in a different country, and he or she wanted to talk to you, how would you go about doing that? I know that I would try to contact them on the computer. I love friends that live out of state and I enjoy talking to them so if we did not have the compuers that we do. these experts are sasying that we are going to drive across the country to talk to them, if you ask me htat is pretty tire consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope that you agree with me in keeping technology in our lives is important because of the future for people to learn nee things about places and people, and also to communicate with friends and family although I can se your part of view that kids are not getting enough exercise most kids that computers are also involved sport.

Dear @CAPS1 -in-@CAPS2, Computers are very helpfull tools in todays society and culture. They build cognitive skills and offer a vast wealth of knowledge. I want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides. First off, computers enchance our hand-eye coordination skills. When typing, we look at the screen, while using our hands to type this becomes almost second-nature after a period of time, proof that it is helping with this cognitive skill. Having good hand-eye coordination is a critical part of driving, and many other tracks we perform throughout the day. Also, you must consider the near infinite amount of knowledge available on this tool. You can learn just about anything on the internet, and most of it is absolutely free. In fact, on websites like @CAPS3 alone, you can find a webpage, dedicated to just about anything. Contrary to the counter-arguments belief, a computer can actually aid in our social life. With instatn messengers like @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 you can converse with people around the world in real time. Social networks like @CAPS5 allow your to keep your friends posted on what you are doing. Please take my letter into account, and publish it in your editorial. I believe computers help us with cognitive skills, learning, and socializing. Thank for your time.
<START>

Dear the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Some people say that computers are a negitive contributor to society. In @CAPS3 opinion, computers have a positive impact on the world around us. I believe @CAPS4 gives people hand-eye coordination and a way to be organized. Not only those but, people are still interacting with others. if you don't beleve me now, read @CAPS3 details and you'll feel the same way I do. When you consider @CAPS4, computers give us hand-eye coordination. there's no way to use a computer without typing. No matter if you're just typing in a short password or a @NUM1 page essay, you'll alway have to type, and when you do @CAPS4 allows better movement at your hands. This can later help you in sports when you get out and exercise. Since computers have become such a popular thing, i think that in the future, typing or using a computer will be in the @CAPS2. this could be of the hand-eye coordination @CAPS4 gives @CAPS3 theory is whatever you think, you type. in addition to hand-eye coordination, computers provide organization which is a big concern in present day life. Do you have picture files laying your house? Well, there's no need to. With computers you store all and files neatly. how your might you can bark those easy to find everything becomes all that are locate. Even doctors are computers your medical needs and give time. Computers can give organize. Furthermore, computers continue to help instead with store say keep friends I can talk with friends or family far away. @CAPS4 keeps us together and gets I'm not saying that @CAPS4's always a good thing, because we all need face to face interaction. Although when you arent able to get that, its a good way to talk. To conclude, computers positivly effect our lives. We're able to get hand-eye coordination, and stay organized when @CAPS4 can be a trouble to do @CAPS4 can bring people together when they aren't in person. You can learn about new things like people and places far away. though people @MONTH1 think opposite of me, i know that computers benifit society.

Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION1, I am writting this letter to you @CAPS4 I think people are not getting enogh exercise @CAPS4 they spend so much time on the computer and they are going to websites here are some things that I want you to write about so people can and @MONTH1 be aware. My first reason I exercise why this @CAPS4 so many people spent so much time on the computer they don't get they don't walk. They sit and want message their frends @CAPS1 day. Not worrying that they are ganning @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 A on their heart @CAPS4 of the @CAPS2. @CAPS4 of this it can @CAPS5 to heath @CAPS6 things could you can't do @CAPS15. m @CAPS7 reason @CAPS8 @CAPS9 websites to moral kids @CAPS10 @CAPS11 things they Are not suppose see when kids have free @CAPS12 computer excise the thing wen let me @CAPS11 this can @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS14 sites, gunsites, @CAPS15 to a things can make something they @MONTH1 really hurt someone or maybe even themselves. Kids try to learn @CAPS15 people talk like @CAPS16 websites things that they are not able to and over they can see Are @NUM1 on @CAPS16 @CAPS18. My third reason chat sites Places to get some attension They will @ORGANIZATION1 things they are not suppose to the @NUM2 year oldd man here some things to write are doing and please monitor them as much as you can to prevent this.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a world without computers. I picture it as a better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world better. Computers @MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer having computers or no? In my opinion people would be better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers is one factor to blame with the @LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy. If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in @LOCATION2 will as well. If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 says "if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them" @CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue. In my opinion the citizens of @LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their. more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly when your on your computer all day you don't realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals. Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more, computer should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer. @CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least your social life could improve if people werent on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would be better off without computers. I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise, enjoy for nature, also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from. There is no need for a computer in your life, but don't speak for everyone. The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now.
<START>

Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON2 and I am here to give you @CAPS1 opinions about computers. Computers are fun and educational. They have lots of websites for games. Such as portaportal, @NUM1.com, they have safe fun games for kids under @NUM2. They also have educational websites that help you with your work. Such as google. Ask your question.com these websites have all the info on things you need help with. They also have @CAPS2, facebook. Yes I know there has been rumors about people threatening over chats. But other than that your able to chat with your friends instead of waiting for your mom to get off the phone. @CAPS2 lets you meet new people without having to tell them who you are. @CAPS1 opinion is that computers are safe in different occassions but are also very fun & educational.
<START>

I think that people shouldnt use the computer's that much because it make's you want to be on it and on it day. Like yea you can play games on it and talk to people like other people you use of lec see I can understand that but the other people around you like that live's with you people that on the computer all day can spend time with there family and friends and to other places then going to look at them on the computer's I mean like to see other people that you see on the computer like chat or like webcam on the computer, you can maybe go see in a other state and go visited them. then being on the computer people that always on the computer should get out because there never going to do things is they are always on the computer, like when @CAPS1 on the computer @CAPS1 on it for a hour are so the I do things with family and friends, but not all the time that @CAPS1 on it, like i understand if you work on the computer at work and then finishing things at home for your work, but once in a you get to spend some time with family and friends, not @CAPS4 be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and @CAPS4 go on the computer and that how people get lazy the start getting fat because they @CAPS4 go on the it and maybe stop to eat and back on the computer, then when they get off of it they will eb all tierd and stuff not feeling like going anywere @CAPS4 to sleep or like if they had sometimes to do after they would be all lazy an not wanted to do anything at all, that why people should get out more and do thing withe there family and friends to have fun withe there like.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I took a poll of @NUM1 people and @PERCENT1 of them agree computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place, teach people hand-eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. Using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. Some of the ways I keep in touch with them are e-mailing, video chating, and instant messaging. Some other good things about talking to people online is if you're talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. Another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand-eye coordination. The ways of teaching this are typing, and clicking on something, @CAPS1 people, when they type, look at the keyboard. But, with pratice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. To click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. That, believe it or not, is hand-eye coordination. One last reason computers are good at helping people is it a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. Another option is , say someone is going on a vacition to @LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it. They can go on the internet and get information on @LOCATION1 with just a couple clicks of the mouse. Finally, say someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 for fun: They type @ORGANIZATION2 in look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. In conclusion, I deffinately think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons I have stated. People can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand-eye coordination, and finially, people can look a person or place up using the internet. This is my opinion on computers, I hope you agree.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer in their home? Well who wouldnt! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, its quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like @CAPS3 and facebook you can talk to people you normally dont get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet you can use websites like google, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also if I had to research a topic for @CAPS1 history project then I would go onto the computer, to google and then type in @CAPS1 topic and be overwelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an at on the project thats how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick I can make @NUM4 powerpoints slides @CAPS6 with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make powerpoint slide: on overage @PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing @CAPS1 social studies project @TIME1 I had to find out what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library. I just hopped on google and clicked images and clicked images and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds @CAPS1 screen was @CAPS6 with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of facebook, myspace, @CAPS3, or twitter? Well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am @CAPS3 or facebook I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time one of @CAPS1 friend from camp lives in @CAPS10 so I dont get to see her alot so with the wonderful invention of facebook I could talk to her all the time. Just think without the computer facebook would have never been invented so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also when I go on the computer. I have the option signing onto something called @CAPS3 or email. With this I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That would happen if the computer wasnt invented. So dont you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well lets make it @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer.
<START>

Do you really think @CAPS1 need computers to live? I agree on spending less time on the computers and spending more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. I this because @CAPS1 and family. And @CAPS1 don't need computer @CAPS1 don't need computers @CAPS2 @CAPS1 are lost on and don't know where @CAPS1 are @CAPS1 get @CAPS3, not @CAPS2 @CAPS1 need to look for something @CAPS1 use ipods. If some people like to chat with each other they use cell phones. Lets say you have a project in class libraies are available. @PERCENT1 of kids like to read. A is great way to bring your reading up. If you don't get that right ideas @CAPS2 you read then you can ask your teachers, @CAPS2 it is appropriate time. Like afternoons or during lunch time. One day @CAPS2 I went to class there was a project due and kid said "I copy all of the words for the computers." And that is call pradizing. So some parents don't see there children pladerize. Sometimes internet is not good for children. Sometimes you need take a break and slow down. You can take a trip and see your family. You can also look out to nature. Exercise, hike, swim and bike. Computers are not family there are not going to make you exercise there going to make you lazy. Now that you've heard about why you should stop going to the computers because you have electronics, libraies and family. You stop and make a change right now. There nothing to loose.

What do you think about computers? I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have @NUM1. Please heed the following advice. Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. I teaches them life skills such as hand-eye coordination, a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states "@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of inter-ation with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts." Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grevious idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law ferm as presidental secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future. People say kids are the future, not if theyre not succesfull. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn & communicate with @NUM1 another & others. We all want our kids to be happy. @NUM4 out @NUM5 kids use the internet to research things for @CAPS2 & projects. Kid therapist @PERSON2 says "kid who chat, with other kids though internet like facebook, @CAPS3, & myspace are normaly more socialy interactive with other kids. I know you thinking there a lot of "@CAPS4" thing on the internet dont want my kids to see, conversly you can set limits & child block. & you also dont want you kids at risk of obesity because of lack of excercise. So give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer @NUM6 hours a day. They do @CAPS2 & whatever time they have left they chat with friends. Its not all @CAPS4. As you can see computers can be seen in a very possotive manner. Heed my advice & allow your kids the freedom of internet. They will be happier, trust me.

Do you like your computer? Does it benifit you and the around you? People are saying that computers dont benifit people. I am writing to prove them wrong, and state why computers benifit us. It helps us with things like learning, communication, and even money or economic problems. First, learning is a very important in a lifetime and computers can help you increase that one hand-eye coordnation is very helpful in different sports like tennis, golf, and hackey too. When you go on the computer, you learn that skill. For example, last @DATE1 i went to tennis with mom and shes never on the computer. She missed every ball thrown to her. Thru computers all around the world, and going on the computer can open you to the whole world. You can see places like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and even @LOCATION3. Overal, has the least computers out of the whole world. Finnaly, computers let you learn typing. In america, there are jobs that are for you to type. If you to type, then you a good job. If you get a good job, then you can be succesful in life. Computers definetly benifit your learning. Second, when. Computers open you up met new friends. One, when you go to school, more with other student. Computers let you talk your you right. According to facebook magazine, @PERCENT1 of all the students in a school chat and talk online to other person. Two, the computer can help you communicate with your family too for instance. If your her got hurt, could e-mail that grandmas hurt. Computers can your family too. Finnaly, computer half in life. For example, kids with cancer, or even need to check them can let you talk to this kinds in. Computer very helpful when social life. Finnaly, computers help you. In that economy it's really hard to find a job. So the computer can help you with that websites online make you take a actualy gives you a place to work.

Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. "I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live." That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.

Dear readers, @CAPS1 if I told you that every time you sit in front of a computer, you are that much closer to death? @CAPS1 if I said that computers are destroying your lives? This @MONTH1 not be that serrws, but its shocking. You can not disagree. I feel that humans should not use computers, or at least use them very scarcely. Computers make people get less exercise, they kill brain cells, and they can ruin your lifestyle. You @MONTH1 believe computers have impared your life, but consequences remain. Many @CAPS2 today are obese and lazy. They don't get any exercise. There are many reasons for this, but one big reason is because they sit in front of computers all day! Computers @MONTH1 improve reflexes and such but you can do that by exercising, also! When you sit in front of a computer, it reels you in. Ten minutes becomes one hour in a snap! That is one less hour of exercise. Virtual sports @MONTH1 be fun, but they keep you from the real ones. Without exercise, one @MONTH1 become obese, develop diabetes or heart problems or even have muscle troubles. These can be hazardous, and even deadly. Computers dont exercise your body, or your mind! Now, that fact bring me to my next point. Computers @MONTH1 have information to teach you, but that type of learning has its consequences. When you sit in front of a computer, your eyes are on the screen. Now, scientists from the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation have found they staring at the screen kills brain cells. Basically, these cells do not reporoduce as easily as other cells, and they sometimes don't reproduce at all. You are just one step closer to death. I'm sure you don't want an death. Try opening a book! They are cheaper, more accurate, and don't kill your cells! Don't stare at the computer screen, because your slowly destroying your body, and knowledge can be gained elsewhere. For a final point, I would like to say that computers simply destroy your lifestyle. Virtual people are not your real friends and family. Computers cause you to turn away from them. Online interaction is not like just talking to someone in person or on the phone. You can lose your real friends. Plus, computers run your lifestyle because half the things you think you are learning arent real. You can't trust certain sites or certain people. Being with ones you know and love is much more beneficial, because computers drag you in you are taken away from the real world. I feel that we should all take a stand against computers. They take away exercise, cause brain cells to die and other problems occur, and they can ruin your lifestyle. No one wants to be a lonely joke! Read a book, get outside and day; but stay away from die screen. There are better alternatives. Take a stand, and do @CAPS1 is best. Be the healthy, happy person, and lay off that computers, so that you can get the best of life!

Dear edditer of my local newspaper In my opinion computers have a positive effect on people. I support the advances in technology. I believe @CAPS1 is a positive thing because @CAPS1 teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allows us to talk online with others. In the following poragraphs I will share with you my opinions and why they are the right opinions for all to believe in. Firstly hand-eye coordination plays a big part in our lives, many of us do sports. Now sports isn't just about being the best @CAPS1's about getting better and doing your best. Sports take alot of practice, and are way is computer games though I bet you didn't know @CAPS1, these games help you develope hand-eye coordination. Defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports. Catching and throwing is a big part in alot of sports and thats all hand-eye coordination, and where do you think you get @CAPS1 from practice and computer games. So next time your on the computer play som games and that will be like practicing for sports and will help you devolop the hand-eye coordination you need to suceed in a sport. Secondly, @CAPS2 in favor for computer use is because @CAPS1 gives us the oppurtunity to learn about places and people from all around the world. Think about @CAPS1 before computers if you want to know something you might have to locate all around for a book that tells you @CAPS1, @CAPS1 could take, now you type what you want to know or google and bing theres your answer. This ability to quickly find what your looking for allows you more freedom to learn and spend other precious time doing other things you want to do then take the to locate and read the right book. As you can see this is a ability and can be a big help when you need to know something fast. So help you yourself and use computers make life easyer. Thirdly computers are a way to communicate they can let you talk to people all around the, when you might and usaly be able do. This is a great way to stay in contact wen people move, go away on a buisness trip go on vacation, or even to meet new people. Say you cany get a hold of someone because there phone is off and its important you talk to them you could email them or if there online and ahave @CAPS3.M. you could @CAPS2(instant message) them. This would save you the hessle of having to keep calling him. Also if you want to see what there doing or where they are you could us a webcome and see them instead of just talking to them. As this paragraph shows internet and computers open more then ever before. As the I wrote above, I showed not even a fraction of what computers are good for. My reasons for computers being more of positive thing, ever a negitive thing are as followed; they help us with learning things that before we couldn't, communicate with others, and help us develope hand eye coordination. I can only hope that as I write my conclusion, "that my opinions were heard and that this letter has helped all see why computers are a great thing, not a bad one.

Dear @PERSON2 "@CAPS1, @CAPS1" I'm sure you all have heard the sound of a mouse or people typing if you have walk into an office, our local library, a doctor's office, or even our districts schools. The reality is that computers and the world-wide-web is seem and used everywhere. Without a computer, how would @CAPS3 be able to access our emails, interact with family memmber across the ocean and finish that research paper out teacher has assigned us? In my opinion, computers hace a phenomenal affect on people and their lives. The computer helps develope hand-eye coordination, learn about specifil subjects and interact with people on the computer. Therefore, with such positive affects, @CAPS3 should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done. Have you ever walked into your schools lab or walked into a office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mouses or the buttons being pressed down on the keyboard? Well, not only is a job being completed, but you are also exercising I remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay. After the second page, my hands hurt very badly, @CAPS4, not only was i completing my essay, I was also exercising my hands. Not only does computers allow you to exercise, it also helps develops hand-eye coordination. Have you ever played a game where you had to cath fist, or playes a fast-pasle game of pinball? Well, those games require one key thing i hand-eye coordination. Computers are very helpful in todays world. The computer and the world-wide-web is useful in several other ways too. The internet also allows you to learn about certain subject or events you might not have a book for. My bestfriend, @PERSON1, called me one day from the train. On the phone, she was frantic because she was giving a speech and she did not know what the statistic was for type @CAPS5 diabetes. What do you do when you have no book for a specific subject? @PERSON3 went on her laptop and found all the information she she dit not know. this is just another way the quick acces to a computer benefits people. "You've got mail" I'm sure you have all heard this before. Besides communicating through letters or on the telephone, the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication. when you need to confirm a meeting place or ask your classmate what problems were assigned homework, what could be a fast mean of communication? Sending a instant message, or e-mail are two ways of course. Not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately. Both your e-mail account and you instant message account have passwords so that only you can access them. Every four out of five households have a computer avalable for completing assignments, checking, e-mails and learning about the, that happend in @LOCATION1 last week. The computer has put a positive affect on numerous people and their everyday need. In my opinion, the computer has been one of the best technologies in history. This amazing technology has helped students, teachers, doctors, police officers and even you bank aggents serve our community and make it a better one. Thank-you.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 society should have computers because it teaches you things that a school or job will never teach you, and it allows you to be in contact with your friends and family that you don't see a lot. I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @CAPS1 society should have computers. First, we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before. I say this because if you wanna know about the @LOCATION1 more and the school or job doesn't teach you as much as you wanna know, then all you have to do is look up on the internet and theres a chance you gonna find it. @NUM1 people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 society because we could contact people online that we heven't spoke to. My opinion is that if you haven't to a friend or family member in a while you can talk to them online. Also, if they don't have a phone or if they do but it's long distance and you can't talk to long distance on your phone, you can tlak to them on or email each other, etc. Sample say if your phone isn't working and the only thing that's working is your computer you to it in contact with somebody. All you gotta do is talk to them online. Would you rather talk on the phone or computer. In conclusion, @CAPS1 society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people. I would like for you to aprreciate my concern on having computers in @CAPS1 society.

Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today, prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities? My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day. The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise, children tend to be addicted to playing on the computer, and if someone's life revolves around the computer than they most likely, won't be able to live on the "real world". When a child sits at the computer all day, they are not getting exercise. Today, obesity is a major problem. If people stay on the computer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease. Also, it is important for children to get fresh air. When someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors. Lastly, who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports, to stay active and have fun. Once you begin to play games on the computer, there is not turning back. In today's society, children of all ages, become addicted to the computer. Children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings. Also, some of these games might be inappropriate for younger players. Lastly, if children become addicted, they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework. If a child is constantly on the computer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the "real world." In the "real world," you can't rely on computer games. Also, games won't teach you things that you can only learn during school. Later in life, when you want to get a job, you won't be able to be accepted because you will not sound knowledgable. Lastly, when you are writing your application to go to a college, they will look at your records of sports and activities you've done in middle school. When they don't find anything, they will reject you because of your lack of participation. So when you are sitting at the computer screen, remember all the possibilities you have other than the computer. For example, it is important for you to exercise, playing games on the computer could make you addicted and you won't be prepared for te "real world". What is your opinion?

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I believe that computers have a negative influence on people. When people are on computers all day they have less time exercising. They are in alot more danger, and they spend less time with there family. These are my only some reasons why computers dontbenefit society.. In more, more time spent on computers equals less time exercising. With the obesity rate rising no one wants to be unable to do regular activitys. With spending all your time on the computer, you would just be using to get over weight and unhealthy. It also makes many people feel self consiou about themselves. If they dont have enough time exercising and keep eating they will become even more self consious. More over it will bring more danger to you and your family. There are many places on the internet where you can meet new people. But how do you know if people are who they seem to be? If you spend more time on the computer then you will increase your chances by @PERCENT3 to get a personal assuts, or even give you personal information up. So why should you take the risk? Just get off that computer! Even if you dont meet on internet assuter you will still be glued to your computer cauzing it more likley to be harrased. I definatly dont want that for my family. The last reason is the most important to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 family. If you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family. This time is verry important because you never know when your family will be gone! And it is a verry scarry topic to think about. I know that most people in @LOCATION1 was spend all the time with there family. On another note a survey shows that @PERCENT2 of children that spend time with there family and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes. Wouldn't you want to make the honnor role in your school? In conclusion, computers have a negiteve effect on people! Spending most time on your computer can causes less time spent exercising, more danger/harm to people, and less time spent with your family. Wouldn't you just rather spend less time on your computer? Thank you for your time.

I think computers are very benefical. There are so many uses! From learning, to games, to videos, and to a tool that is very useful. Without computers we would be like the @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 offense any @CAPS1 people). We would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to see becalling news. Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are lots of things to do. You can play online games, off-line games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. Without the internet I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I now am a member of the online community called www.MOCpages.com I post my creations, look at others creations, and comment, and chat. I use the internet to reasearch for school projects. Right now, I am reasearching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Normally I would have to slave over books to find something. Now it is much easier, because keywords are matched. Finally, it is a good fool. Did you know the millitary needs computers to store info, attack, keep record, and to pilot certain planes? I need to use a computer to type up home work, because as you can see, my hand writing isn'@CAPS4 the neatest. Also, I stay in touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I persuaded you on my position. Remember computers, do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a fantastic tool. Thanks for reading, bye!

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, To many people it is so much fun but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so much that they loved. My stand is that computers hurt peoples. Money, weight and sleep. My opinion is my opinion but I will stand strong with what I have. My father is favorite is the financial deal. With five kids and one laptop who would want to be happy. With people sitting and staring at a computer game all day the bills just keep billing up until you lose everything, such as your house, family, money, ect. But who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer. My favorite is the overweight problem. Yeah I agree it is nice to sit in a soft cushy chair with your computer and bowls of chips and boxes of pizza but sooner or later all that fatty food will catch up to you when you least expect it but will you get up and take a jog, run on a treadmill or go for a @NUM1 walk. Probably not will that computer game running. That wright will keep coming until you can't even move. Sitting at a @NUM2 will really have your eyes, brain, muscles and other important bodyparts due to lack of sleep and want for it. I can relate this to my brother with his dis. The be gets home, boom he is on it until maybe @NUM3 or @NUM4 o'clock in the @TIME1. Eventually he is going to get sick and I'm not to blame for it. When you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late. Now as a common teen to love to go on the computer but one thing I do not do is sit and watch movies or play games every hour of every day. I get outside and run so that I will not fall victim to weight. Financial, and body problems, like @MONTH1 people do. So don't waste your life on a game or chat room get out there and do something like sports or just get some fresh air.
<START>

Many people say that computer is help them in their every day life. A few examples are you could learn about places you didn't know about by searching on google. You get facts reviews about the place. You are exercising your fingers. It helps with communicating with other people. It can help you find long lost family. It reunites lots of family & friends you might have been looking for. Also with hand & eye coordination. And that means you can write/type without having to look at other features that cames through with a computer is going online. You can look & browse at things available in a store. Without driving all the way to the store & wasting gas & polluting the air. I.Ms a way of finding what's happening world wide & breaking news. You can still interact with family & friends & can meet new people. There's e-mail, instant messaging & much more. So you can always interact with & if they dont have a account signing up is. If you just go into nature you don't know what's there. You could look it up and find out what the park has to offer. And that concludes my opinion on how computers are helpful & lots of diverse ways.

Dear local newspaper, @DATE1 I am going to write to you about if I think computers are a good idea or not. Yes, I do think computers are @CAPS12 awesome idea. I think this because @CAPS1 @CAPS2, you use computers for school projects. Next @CAPS2, it is @CAPS12 easy way to make friends from other towns. Last @CAPS2, you @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Yes, the electric bill could be higher, but for a good cause. You @CAPS10't just assume computers are bad for us, you might be surprised. @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am going to explain to you why we need computers to do projects. Well, I @CAPS5 from personal experience, my social studies teacher always likes you to type your final draft. Also, using a computer makes your projects easier because @CAPS3 @CAPS4 fixes your mistakes, and @ORGANIZATION1 finds everything you need. I find it much more easy to use a computer for projects and I @CAPS5 all of my friends think it is also. If you aren't persuaded yet, keep reading because I @CAPS5 you will be eventually! Next @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you about making friends just with a computer. I @CAPS5 that parents these days are really happy when you have come home and made new friends. Just by using a computer you could easily go online, search friends you want to @CAPS11 to @CAPS5 better, and chat with them. (to make sure they are who you think!) The other day my friend @PERSON1 came up to me and said meet my friend @CAPS6 I met online! I was really happy for her and realized computers are helpful. Everybody needs friends that are there for them, and computers are the perfect conclusion for that! Last @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you more about why and how you could @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Do you @CAPS5 what @ORGANIZATION1 is? You @CAPS10 search @CAPS7 on @ORGANIZATION1! If you really wanted to @CAPS5 something and you were really curios you could search on @ORGANIZATION1! This is a great way to @CAPS11 educated. Also, computers help you with @CAPS12 @CAPS13 because everytime you are on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 typing a random story it will fix your mistakes, and you will learn off of these mistakes. So, to sum up this paragraph, a computer is @CAPS12 easy way to @CAPS11 @CAPS12 easy @CAPS13, and YOU need to keep computers to see for yourself. In conclusion, I was asked to write a paper to you seeing if I would like to keep computers or not. By now you @CAPS5 that I would like to. In case you are iffy about my reasons, I will simply restate them. @CAPS1, you need a computer for projects. Second, you @CAPS10 make friends. Last, you @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. All of these things are a huge benefit in laer life. Don't forget YOU @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13! That is whta everybody would like! I @CAPS5 you will come through to yourself and agree. Thank you for listening to me.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. Computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. Computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficent and that i like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. Finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. If you give a person to coose from a computer or a set of encyelpedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or enclyelpedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficent than books. In conclusion, i believe that computer have a posieve effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficent and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers.

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye codination, also give people the ability to and lastly they allow people to talk online. First, they teach hand eye codination and I think thats good because when people get a job they can probably more focused and can probably work faster. So if people can do that when they get a job and their jobs involve working on a computer it can be easier for them and their job can be more enjoyable. Second they give people the ability to learn more because we have all these sites that involve information an everything so people can be more knowledge so if they're more knowledged they can probably get a really good job that pays alot. And they can look up whatever they like. So if they reasearch alot and go to school they can get the job they always wanted because they know so much knowledged people are better people. Lastly they can talk to online people when people can contact each other its better because if they have no phone to reach someone they need to reach they got a computer that they can either email or use a webcam were they can see the person. I think that having a computer is good for all these reasons having hand eye cordination give people the ability to learn more and allow people to talk online with other people.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I don’t think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldn’t you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldn’t get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldn’t get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you think that computers have a bad effect on people? I @CAPS4. People spend to much time on the @CAPS5. When they need to be working on their @CAPS5 they get distracted and start to go and @CAPS4 their own thing. Other people sit at their @CAPS5 and get mad or angry at @CAPS6. When people dont know what to @CAPS4 they just go on their @CAPS5. When working on the @CAPS5 you get distracted. I am sight, People get distracted because they see that little intenet button cont of the corner of their eye. then they just click the internet symble. Then their on the internet out doing their job. The internet is not the only distraction on a @CAPS5. The games are @CAPS10 distraction, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and hearts are all game that came on the @CAPS5 People get mad or angry at their @CAPS5 because @CAPS6 does not enough @CAPS6 delets a they need, or @CAPS6 simply wont turn on because its dead. They blame all of this on the @CAPS5: @CAPS6 @CAPS6 does not load fast enough the person might say, "@CAPS7 on why use you being so slow I need to get my paper for work!" @CAPS6 the @CAPS5 delets the paper the person @MONTH1 go, "@CAPS9 is the paper I saved @CAPS6! are you play a game on me?" But if the poor @CAPS5 is dead and wont turn on then the person @MONTH1 go, "why are you turning on you stupid computed" @CAPS10, people all of their time on the @CAPS5. They are and con't find same thing to @CAPS4 they for the @CAPS5. Not the best idea I say, People in the @ORGANIZATION1 have actsets to a @CAPS5. At home, evern on their phone. the @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1 is becoming a problem in my eyes spending to much time on the @CAPS5 can lead to be over weight because you are going on the @CAPS5 in stead of going out and hangin with your Friends. in @CAPS11 I belive that @CAPS5 have bad effect on people, They get distracted on them at work. They blame them for thing the forget to @CAPS4. They use them to much these for people can stop going to gyms and get over weight. So @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a bad on people? yes they @CAPS4.

Do you have computer at home that you go on? Everyone goes on the computer for many different reasons with friends or for projects and @CAPS5 like that. Computers can be good in many ways but they can not be. Computers are made it do all @CAPS5 to help us learn. I personally think that computers are good. We can learn @CAPS5 that are going on from far away. An example is if we have a big project in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 about @LOCATION2, and we dont know the computer can look all different focus and see pictures. Computers can the history of place not us. I can sister talking how they had that has to be taken using a computer. The answer in the question world war @CAPS3. She got a @PERCENT1 we @MONTH1 also be able to see whats going on with the @LOCATION1 and different place. All you have to do for that is go on the compute and look it up. "okay class today we will be going down in the computer to do some research." said my teacher. "what are we going "@CAPS4." @CAPS5 that are going on the @LOCATION1. All of these @CAPS5 can us research projects many other @CAPS5. We can also use computers. Computers also have different @CAPS5. An example at the program can help us that they let us look information, play game, help with our homework. I have just realized that you can pretty much do anything you want on a computer. @CAPS2 shows that @PERCENT2 of people in the @LOCATION1 go on the computer for help with their. I can remember my friend telling me that she always types her essays because its for her teacher and from typing. So the program is helpful to us. people always go on the computer and love @CAPS5 that are an save, at their. I usually do that so I know when a good is to an in the to buy what I want. Well you should really consider thinking about this those cant even reasons the people in the @LOCATION1.

Computers can be very useful to people. They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet. If you had a friend or family member move away, computers are an easy way to contact them. Phones dont always give you that option to call from around the world. Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers. What if you want to chat with someone right next door even if theres a blizzard and the snow is four feet, computers are a simple way to contact them. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 for the @DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all? Imagine you, writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday. Typing is an easy solution that doesnt require as much work and it takes less time. Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read. Not even a library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library wont immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully? You cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport. You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say "@CAPS3 it upon google" when they dont know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog, I never even heard of. When I got home I went on the internet and researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and its fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper.

Did you know that the positive effects computers have on people the negative? I believe that the usige of computers increases one's knowledge of faraway places safety can be used for communication and can make everyday task easier computers have become the tools of society. Firstly, using computer allow a floridian to learn about connecticutions; or a canadian to learn about the world around them. safely. In a by the @ORGANIZATION1, it has been shown that without the computer, @PERCENT1 of all people would have been ignorant of the one-child dilemna in @LOCATION3. In addition, since the crime rate in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 is @PERCENT2 having comilted, an american might not went to visit @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, they mush learn about it for a business project. What do they do? They venture onto the computer and and everything they need to know about @LOCATION1, from the security of their home. While people can learn about faraway places from the safety of their houses, can also the computer for communication purposes. The computer is a great tool for communicating with other people. In a done in @DATE1, @PERCENT3 of computer users had some sort of social networking or instant mesaging program. Some examples of these are @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, respectively. being able to contact people has never been easier. Did you know that out of every @NUM1 americans spend an average of a hours online everday? So truly that the average I.Q has increased in the last @NUM2 years? When online, students can receive help from fellow students, teachers, and even experts! users of the computer can get feedback from essays, support to something new, and even boost self confidence. Communication is a great utilixation of computers, as is the simplicity to perform everyday tasks online. In today's society, the computer can make everyday tasks so much easier! when I was a child, my mom spend hours in the local grocery, shopping for food. That all changed when my mother discovered @LOCATION2. It is a safe and easy way to buy food online to then have it delivered not only, but @PERCENT4 of americans with computers have paid their taxes online. A once job has become simple, with the mere click of a button it is nerve-wrecking that the majority of our day need not be filled with flooring errands, but what we want! Whether that be to exercise or simply enjoy nature. In a nutshen, computers are great assets to society. They have a muriad of purposes and functions. They can inrease a person's knowledge of faraway places safely, be used for communication purposes. and make everyday tasks simple. Its hard to even ruminat how we managed before this device come along.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I do not no where to start this letter. Im writing you this letter to let you know that I think that not everyone should use a computer. My first reason not everyone should use a computer is because they get so distracted in the computer they forget about school. My second reason not everyone should use a computer is because they @CAPS4 dont spent time with there parent. My third reason they shouldn't have people use the computer often is because they would get sick. My firs reason computer shouldnt be used often is because they forget about school. They forget about it in the way that there so distracted writing or chating or playing @CAPS4 that they forget about school. @CAPS5 reason is because their grades get low. They dont do homework either. My second reason is because they dont parents. Are more could be there so the computer they dont. My third reason is because their get computer there get @CAPS4 they dont and not @CAPS5 could that they dont get no education for being in the computer. That is why is bad to use a computer a lot I hope u understand.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there is alot of talking and arguing about computers. Some say they are helpful to society and others say not. As for myself I am one of those on the side of which is for computers. I think the do alot less harm than good. First of all the hand-eye cordination of the user is mostly improved over a period of time, which helps withe learning musical instruments. Also it gives a great learning ability to people, particularly student. If there were computers, for a student to do a report he/she would have to read through an encyclopedia, which takes a great amount more time than plainly looking it up on the internet. Finaly computers are great for communicating with far-away friends or family. The first subject on my agenda is the hand-eye cordination skills. These skills are the ability to work with your hand and eyes simultaniously. There is a number of impacts these skills can make. The most apparent is musical instruments. If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar you must move your fingers to the notes coresponding with the screen. Another place where hand-eye cordination comes in handy is sports. One sport where hand eye cordination makes a huge impact is in football. If the ball is thrown then the wide recever must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball. I am also going to argue the vost world of learning that is provided by computers. Lets just say someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2 where would you go to find that answer? I don't know about you but I am definatley going to look it up on google (internet search engine). Also schools @CAPS1 can ask alot more of their students because they have all this information at there desposal. Lastly I would like to cover the communications abilitys that the computer puts out there. First of all let say you have a very close friend move out-of-state" how are you going to keep in touch. You could try using phones but yet the long-distance fees have sky-rocketed over the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long distance for @NUM3 mins a day that would be over @NUM4 a month. in todays ecconmy you need to save money not talk it all away. The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each-other. So hopefully my letter will be able to surposs "@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill" to at least make it somewhere in the paper. People need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them."

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers, and @CAPS2 people use them. It's been brought to my attension that the government is worried about people using them to much. Well I think you can't use a computer too much. They offer so @CAPS2 things such as information, communication, and life skills. That doesn't too bad. Informaiton is something we as humans live for. Also in @CAPS2 schools and jobs you need to know a variaty of unusual facts. Where can you learn these? Computers of course! When @PERSON1 (my teacher) gives us a research paper on walt disney, we use computers to find our information. With out the computer, I wouldn't know walt disney died before disney world opened. That clearly shows one of the @CAPS2 things we need computers for. Communication is another aspect of our lives. With a computer you can have @MONEY1 ways to comunicate. Yes some of these way can be dangerous but, @CAPS2 are safe. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teacher ms.casserelle set up a classwide email for us. This allowed us to email another school. This farm of online communication was perfectly safe. As long as the person using these forms of communication is sem-responsible nothing can go wrong. Where can you go wrong with that? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of your life skills can and are learned on computers? As a matter-a-fact your job involves a computer! One life skill you can learn is how to type. As I stated earlier research papers need computers, well it's not just for the information. You have to type them too. Most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other. Can you think of a job that doesn't require one at all? Ididnt think so. Information, communication, and life skills are all important to our human nature. Ithink computers are important to humans. Wether you admit it or not everything we do involves a computer to some degree. Can you spend @CAPS2 countless hours on a computer? Yes, but you need to. you need to.
<START>

Computers are a huge impact on society, but do they make everything better? People spend way to much time on the computer. Computers do not help you brain they can make you fat and for a lot of people they cause drama. People should stop spending so much time on computers. Computers do not help you brain in any means possible. Think about it, sure you do alot of you work on computers but, what about your kids they spend most of their time gand online and doing pointless stuff. Instead they could be going outside or even study. the internet is open to the world so anyone goes on it and if your child is on the computer is exposed many vile things that will not help them in the future. Its a proven fact that the less time you spend watching tv or on the computer you get better grades. I remember my mom always yelled at me for being on the computer and getting bad grades so she took the computer away for a while and now i have much better grades. So being on the computer does not make you smarter. The computer can make you gain quit a bit of weight. If your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer. So now you are sitting around the computer eating. That can make you gain weight. I know from experience that being active and going outside or exercising really makes you feel good. Once you gain all that weight it is very hard to get rid of it. Sitting around like a couch is not healthy. You can become obese. So you could say your happy with your weight but no one ever said it was healthy. A lot of people have died frombeing that beaky. It puts a huge tall on you life. If you dont want to die from being to heavy then I advise you to get off the computer and go outside and live yor life. The last thing that makes computers so bad is the drama they cause. Mose pople have facebook, aim, or @CAPS1 but if you ask anyone with one of those they will most likley say they have gotten in a fight through one of those. Also now they have something new called formspring which can let you be anomous and people go on yours and just say horrible things. One of my friends was a victim in that and it ruins you. Also their are so many people on facebook that lie about who they are and anyone can easily find out who you are and kill you now a days people know how to hack into peoples computers and get info. So computers can not only be unhealthy but they can be deadly. Why would you want any of those things to happen, when its so easy to just back on your computer time. Remember computers dont help your brain, they can make you fat, and they cause a lot of drama. So please dont use the computer.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 of people use computers @CAPS2 for many different types of things. Computers are very beneficial to society. Even though people @MONTH1 use their computers too much, the tasks they complete help our world run smoothly. Also, computers allow us to keep in touch with friends and family that we don't see anymore, and they teach us valuable information very quickly. Without computers, society would not run as smoothly as it does now. One way that computers benefits our society, is that they complete tasks such as writing a paper, researching information,..etc, much quicker. For example, if you, the @ORGANIZATION1, needed to quickly print an article in the paper on the devastating earthquake in @LOCATION1, computers would greatly benefit you because they would allow you to type the article much quicker than having to handwrite it. Computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently. Another reason why computers are very beneficial to society is because they allow us to maintain relationships with people from long distance and allow us to always keep in touch with old friends and family. Moving to from about @DATE1, computers have greatly helped and I stay halfway country. In a recent survey by @PERCENT1 of college graduate a computer stay in town friends from stay in but allow you to actually see the are our society is beneficial by computers because they world. reason society is because they alloe people very quickly. Search engines such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, and more allows us to research anything we want to know at just the click of the button. This ability to know anything very quickly has agreat effect on people, without of this knowledge people becomemore intellectual and intelligent and with that intelligence, they make great things happen. According to @PERSON1, a computer scientist at @ORGANIZATION2, The knowledge people get from computer search engines allows them to better do @CAPS2 things and achive more in thier lives". Computers benefit society and have great effect on people when they are balanced our with other important things such as exercise and socializing. They teach us new information quickly, perform tasks, quickly and effeciently and allow us to keep in touch with people across the world. If it weren't for computers things would take longer to get done and society would become worse. We need computers to do @CAPS2 things and do tasks needed to live life."

I think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because @CAPS1 has bad things online. @CAPS1 makes people stupid, and @CAPS1 makes you lazy. Those are the @NUM1 reasons why you shouldn't stay on the computer all day. One of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like kidnaps. I seen a lot of video and movies about kidnaps when an older men or women starts taking to some young kids and they go meet some place and the young teen or kid never comes back. Another reason is that the computer makes you stupid for example when I use to be on the computer all day I would get out to get something to eat and some times I would go in the bathroom to get food and then I notice that thats not the kochen @CAPS1 feels like I just woke up when I got off. My last reson is that computer makes you lazy. The computer makes you lazy because you just stay in the computer all the time sitting on the chair without sun light or exercise @CAPS1 will make you want to stay here more and its not good for you mind and body. These are my three reasons why you should not stay on the computer, the more you the more you will want to stay. So don't stay on the computer because there is bad things in there, @CAPS1 will make you lazy. Please don't stay on the computer for a long time.

Dear local newspaper, I think that using a computer can benifit people and have a negative on people. Benifits could be, gaining knowledge, and meeting new people, bad effects could be, weight gain, and having a lack of social skills to talk with friends over phone etc. First, gaining knowledge is really essential. The I think that is because when your computer crashes or breaks you would most likely know what to do to fix it. I dont think you would want to have to pay money to get anti software that probubly doesn't work. Anothe reason why I think that gaining using computer is good because what if you want become a computer enginere, all that time you've spent on the computer could really benifit you later on in life. Secondly I think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states. Not you have to meet them in person you could just have a friendly consversation online. The thrid and last reason why sometimes computers can be bad for you is weight gain. Most are probably so much time on the computer that there not getting enough physical activities. All they do is sit down eat on unhealthy snack and play games, and videos. That's really bad for your health. I conclusion using a computer moderately is a lot better then using a lot. It could help gain knowledge, meet new people or make you gain weight and have a lack of social skills.

Dear editor, @CAPS1 you think that people spending a lot of time on the computer is good, I don't. People should get more exercize. Also they don't get enough fresh air. Finnaly they don't spend enough time with family and friends. Now we have to determin weather people should spend a lot of time on the computers. Those people who spend alot of time on the computer could be going outside everyday to get exersize. Some parents got their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going out side to get exersize. They could ride bikes, scooters, play basket ball, wiffle ball. They can also go swimming play, sports, and go to a play ground. Finnally they could go for a long walk on the beach. People need to get fresh air instead of being on the computer all day. They can go sit on the beach for awile, go outside to watch their kids play or watch their games like baseball or basket ball, or they can go outside just to be outsides. They can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school. Those people who love to play on the computor don't spend enough time with their family or friends. They could go visit their family more often, go out for lunch with their frinds. Also they can spend more time doing things with their kids. Even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person. The time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not. They don't ge enough exersize every day. They also don't get enough freshair. Finally they spend time with their friends and family. So now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing.
<START>

To my opinion computers have a negative effect on people I think it has a negative because it causes people to get less exercise you spend less time with your family and friends and it distracts you from things get done. First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games practicingg these they will just computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done. WIthout even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college those things include getting out around, but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends. i went over my I sat right and she didn't even look at me playing computer games. i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer. Lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them. It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because, they are absorbent in they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're budy playing game or surfing the web. i know that if I did I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because, it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people, as much, and it distract them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less those on the computer!

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have been complates about computer in are society. They say they are keeping children inside doing nothing, but really they are helping us so much! The internet is where you can resurch anything and tones of helpful ideas come up. @CAPS3, @CAPS5 helps us with hand-eye cordination. Lastly, computers alowe us to stay in touch with people who are far away. Like last year my friend went to poland and we were able to talk threw are computers! So lastly join me and help the world know that computers are good! First off I would like to say the computer is a good source of information. How would you like @CAPS5 if you still had to read scrolls from grene when you could look at on online? Not to manchin not any you need to know some thing really fast like now your stalk is befor a big meeting. Then all you have to do is simple type in what you want to know then bam! Just like that you know, and off to you meeting. Secondly, using the mouse and keys on a computer can incless your hand-eye cordination. Like my parents aways say when i'm typeing on esay, @NUM1 words per minute is a good minute. @CAPS3, out of @NUM2 kids get better hand-eye cordination after geting good on the computer. Alot of times kids have a ten of cordination, but I have a that if kids on the thing will change. Most importantly the computers and faraway like I menchind befor I stayed intouch with my polish buddy @CAPS3, a lot of people don't have cell phones so they have an @CAPS4, gmail, facebook, my space, or a twitter. All of this alows us to stay in touch and keep us up in are friends lives. This is very important because if we are social the we will get out with are friends and do stuff, wich is very important for are. In conclusion, @CAPS5 is good for are society to have computers in are lives. @CAPS5 will help us in the future, we will get good grades on project because of are sources. We will be heathy with hand eye cordination, from the mouse and keybord. Lastly we will have many friends. thes are all very important in. So keep computers!

Dear readers, I right to you today about the effects of computer usage. I feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer. You can talk to people, and you can get work done, but if you are at this to much you'll be starting to gain bad health and miss other things in life. Throughout the computer, there is many ways to communicate with others, which is an amazing thing. Whether it be through a game, typing or real chatting, it's very important to talk to people and this makes things much easier than going out nad talking to people face to face. For, example penpals, over the years people have written letters to their penpals, but know you can send it over mail and email doesn't cost any money, just type up your letter click a button and done. Another positive point about computers is that you're able to get work done on it. From work for a business to school work, it doesn't matter. You bear of people using computers to do work all of the time. Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices. Computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with. Presentations, essays, graphs, anything. A concern I have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers. Many younger people are overusing computers wich leads to bad health. When people sit in front of a computer screen all day only getting up to grab something to eat, people will because obese. To stall healthy people need to be outside and exercise. We need to make rules to keep people out in the open out to give the generation a healthy life. So, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be amazing for a while but only for a while. And if you can't see this open your eyes

To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. I believe that computers are a great tool for several reason. First, computers are a learning resource, and a way people stay updated with the world around them. Also, computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily. Clearly, computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades. Today if I need to know something, whether it be for @ORGANIZATION1 or my own reason I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources. This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 recently preformed a study on high @ORGANIZATION1 teenagers and concluded that, "@CAPS1 with access to computers scored signficantly better on standard testing due to background information they have accquired while on line". Along with the internet, there are programs such as @ORGANIZATION4, and @ORGANIZATION3, which help people to learn a new language, or write on the computer. Also, computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world. For example, when the earthquake devestated @LOCATION1, I first saw it on the news, but got very few details. I the looked it up on line and imediatly get the death toll, the aid that was being given, and ways I could help donate. Without computers, I would have known none of this. Another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others. With things like facebook and @CAPS2, I can chat with people, invite friends over, and even plan parties. Without computers, I would need to call each person individualy, but with computers I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once. This gives me more time to do things like play outside and exercize. Also, things like @CAPS3 and face book help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends. Studies done by @ORGANIZATION5 show that @PERCENT1 of people with some type of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not according to doctor @PERSON1 this means that these people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations than these who do not. Clearly, this is a great benefit. In conclusion, the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it. It easily allows people to stay educated, updated, and connected. It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything. It makes things that would other wise take lots of time very quick, giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside. It keeps people socialy capable and active, and allows people to connect with others. Without a doubt, computers are a very good thing.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 have effects on people and there lifes. Cause alot of people as in children spend there time after school plan games, myspace, facebook and there e-mail address. Instead of going on computers. I think that children and adults should go-out and have good time theres not a problem with going on the computer once and awhile but if you spend all days on a computer then thats pretty bad. Adults shouldnt let there children spend all day on a computer and adults shouldn't eather because it went help you life. Computers could mess your life up by choices you make and pictures you put up and things you write up there such as if you have a myspace or facebook and you put bad pictures up in you furture when you want a good job they could just look back at that and say look at this I don't want this person working for me. and there you go messing up your furture. instead of going on the computer all the time you could go outside do sports to keep your body health and go out in the world and learn new things or even plan trips to go on with your family walk around and stuff like the instead of going on the computer's and putting your self at risk of looseing job or messing up your future. You shouldn't let computer's mess your life up because if you do then your life want be the same children could mess there life up because things they wrote or pictures they put up witch other kids could see and be mean to them and talk about them fot the rest of there school year or things could lead to a fight over one little word you said or picture you put up because you thought it was cute. Sex offenders are on computers and some people don't even no it intill they get tookin away or killed. Parents don't always no when there is sex offender around or online talking to you or your children trying to go meet up with them. They also could put fake pictures up to try to get you to speak to them or to get you to meet them some where so they could take you. so you shouldn't let the computers get to you.

Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in you Newspaper. The @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizan would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought @CAPS13 would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunatley, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, @CAPS8 was eastastic to feel like @CAPS8 was home again. @CAPS8 ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. @CAPS8 might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as spanish and french have @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A. but the average grade for kids @CAPS15 a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. Computer also save a massive ammount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. "@CAPS10 night i had @CAPS11 homework. I had vocals @CAPS8 is a galore to deal with. I had to look up @CAPS10 word in the huge dictionary, I was failing @CAPS11 because i just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, @CAPS13 was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in @CAPS11." @CAPS15 her computer, @PERSON6 would have to have and @CAPS11 @NUM2. @CAPS8 would have just kept failing @CAPS15 her time-saving computer. ALso, @PERSON3 says that @PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio. He says that @PERCENT3 of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computer allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertabrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. @CAPS15 his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college. Obviously, being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does @CAPS13 allow people to learn about places other than their home, @CAPS13 also gives us more time and allow us to talk to other withour ever leaving the comfort on home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer.

Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a possitive effect on people because you could chat online. There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. And you can pay your bills on the computer. People that have no phone od don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website can chat to friends and family. Also many people that have websites like facebook, myspace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. And some people do find that @CAPS1 person that they been looking for. I think that they jusy come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn there alaphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling, This is a good product for little kids so they cam use the extra work over, the @DATE1 or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. One day I had my mother what she was doing and the light bill so i was like how can you and she said and a website bt I forgot what's it called and you could pay your bills right there. So instead of up going in your are go to a local show when thay pay bills and can like or if you get a computer you can do that in you home with no . So people who publish the newspaper I think and I hope you think to this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time.

People are asking me, "@CAPS1 you think we should spend more or less time on computers"? I say we should spend less time on the computer because children spend to much time on online games. Second kids and adults spend to much time on myspace, facebook, msm, and even aim. My third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising. These are my three reasons why we should spend less time on computers. My first reason we should all spend less time on computer is children play so many online games, such as @CAPS2 of warcraft, @CAPS3, soilder front, ect. A problem with kids playing these games become addicted to them, and will play for hours. Children should be outside getting bigger muscle, getting strong bones. Kids keep playing these games and are ruining their lifes. This is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer. My second reason why we should spend less time on computers is children and adults spend to much time on the following: myspace, facebook, twitter, aim, msm, ect. These online pages causes people to go on one to connect to their friends. Also with these online pages they cause to much and could lead to fight or rumors. About @PERCENT1 of kids and adults go on these online pages every day its time they stayed going on their computer more time on outside or hangout with their friends. My last but not the least reason is kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer. Children should go outside with their friend and play sport or games, something that doesn't involve with the computer. This is my third reason why children should not we spending more time on computers. As I said before people should spend less time on computer. Kids spend to much time on online games. Adults and kids spend to much time on online pages. And last children should be playing outside. Its time we put a timer on our computer and spend more time outside.

Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, You use a computer a lot right? Good if you @CAPS7 because @CAPS7 you beleive that experts are questioning why @CAPS5 use them a lot? Well I think people need them because its how @CAPS5 know whats going on in the world, its how @CAPS5 know how the weather is like so accidents can be avoided, and you you can flip on your @CAPS2.V., but than you have to wait for what you want to go on. So you decide @ORGANIZATION1, should @CAPS5 be outside more? Don’@CAPS2 you need to know whats going on too? Of course you @CAPS7, everyone does. I think that it is important that @CAPS5 know @CAPS4 a meteor is about to strike the world no? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets info. On whats going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? Don’@CAPS2 think so. Im @PERCENT1 sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn’@CAPS2 want to be known as the accident State. Well thats why @CAPS5 need the computer! For people to know if I will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic than @CAPS5 need to go to the internet to find out @CAPS4 and where and what time. CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says “@CAPS4 someone says ‘@CAPS5 might be getting some snow or rain’ than they usually go right to the internet ” You you can turn on your @CAPS2.V. to find out whats going on, but not all of it you will want/need to know. So you will have to wait. The internet just does it right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection) @CAPS7 you think these reasons are making a good argument? I @CAPS7. @CAPS7 you use your computer for finding out whats going on, what the weather is like, and instead of the @LOCATION2? If so I think you would aggree with me.

I think that using computer is fine. Reason why I think you have family from far away. Instead of talking hearing voice on the phone. They can talk to each other but most of all see each other. Show cool thing you have that are new. When you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip. Computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car. You can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you. Also now you can buy food on internet and lots more. Saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money. Lots of dating sites to meet diffent people to go out and give your commets. Texting on facebook can let you save money by texting for free. Playing free online games with your friends. You can make website and you can watch movie and show online. There just a lot of thing you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside exercise but I agree with some expert. Lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. This techology people are big they don't go out more. They eat lots of food. But computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun. Those are my reason why I think that computer are great and sould be used more.
<START>

Computers is a good benefit for people. First, computer is a helpful machine in diffrent ways, like I personally go on computer and check for my homework with it. Computer is also good because whenever you don’t know something, you can just go on the internet and search it. Computers won't effect out health if we don’t use it for a long time, computers could help students making project. By using word, exell and other microsoft ware. So I think computers are a great machine for people to have. Secondly, using computer could also socialize with people, many students inculding me uses face book, so even if we are not right next to each other, we can still talk. Computers could be used to make new friends too, “but their is people you don’t know and we are not surpose to give out our information.” said @PERSON1 our health teacher. Computers could be useful to friends that live far away, if your friend moved to another state, you could use computer to chat with him, their is many ways to social with computers. Lastly, exercising is important to everyone, but using computers doesn’t mean we can not go outside and exersice anymore, maybe computers are addictive, but if you keep track of time and maybe use the computer for - half an hour at a time, you can still get the exercise you need. Exercising is an easy thing to do, children likes to exercise so their sould not be a problem, like my nabor alway come over to my house and ask if I want to play football while I was talking with someone on the computers but I still went outside and play, so computer is a great machine thats not very addictive so parents doesn’t have to worry about children exercising. I think computers have great effects on people, like going online to do a research or talk to friends. Grown ups need them to work. So that proves computer is a great machine.

Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computer scientest have found cours for deseses, jobs have become easier and communication with friends or family have become afordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people on places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to phone without having to pay for anything. Is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could have them find afordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events. any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up and now computers can be as big as a flat screen @CAPS1 and you can turn them on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?

Dear @CAPS1 post, I have been thinking about the way computers affect our lives. Oh this very topic, I am agreeing with the experts who say people are sending too much time on their computers and less time doing other things. I do believe everyone, including myself, spends a lot of time online. Even if it was research, don't you think it would be better to stick our head in a book to get the information? The same thing apires to computer games, such as virtual kickball outside? The main reasons I am trying to get are computers hold us back, they are not physically able to help us, and going away from the computer, or even going outside would be better. I had mentioned how computers hold us back, the more time we spend; the more daylight we burn to do other things. I say this because instead of going outside. We want to stare at a screen and play games or chat with friends. Online chat especially has an effect on most people because were trading in a fun day for one where we just talk online and back internet. I also believe if we had a time limit on computers it is more a push to be social and go out and do things. Unforthetly, computers from that, and all we end up waiting to do is nothing. Another reason is that computers can't physically help us and make us active. I can to this one because I am a cheerleader, and I am constantly on youtube learning how to stretch and do new things. Even though I learn and spend time to watch how it's done I get hurt and can't do it. Which is why I try getting cut more to a gymnastics teacher who can physically help and interact with how I'm doing. Lastly, I believe that the less time we spend would help us and be so much better. I know, after an hour or more online. I feel lazy and I don't want to do anything. However, if I go outside I feel full of energy and I'm active. Being off the computer feels better and is better. To sum it all up, computers are great to have, but to much of them isn't. It really does hold us back, and is worse for our health. Oh, and one last thing, too much time makes you less active. However, thank you for reading.

You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! "This project will be done on the computer," how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. From searching pictures and information for a school projects, watching videos of songs, friends, or tv shows that you love or wonna check up on. to looking at websites. Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously! "Have you change your mind? have you listened closely?" @CAPS3 so your life just become a whole lot easier, by using facebook, for social ability, @ORGANIZATION1 and windows programs for school, and google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer!

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button. That is as simple as just going out and purchasing a computer. Computers are becoming more and more popular. Some people think that people use computers too much. I am here to say that, that is a terrible accusation. First, computers help you with school work. Let's say you have an essay and it needs to be @NUM1 words or more you can just use word cant, then you have the exact amount of words. Also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic. You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from. If you had a homework assignment that you didn't understand you could look up how to do it on the internet. But this i just the begining. Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture. You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from @LOCATION1. You would also be learning about their culture. This could also be a way to learn another language. If the person spoke fluently in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 than he or she could teach you. You might be able to see how an @CAPS2 household runs. You could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life. Finally, you can understand the world around you. There are many websites where you can get a live sattelite feed on places on every corner of the globe. You could also do reasearch on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it. You might also learn about nature. You could understand more about plants and animals. You can also got a look into space. You can learn about planets, if there is life on planets or water or anything else these would be things you can reasearch. So to sum it all up, you can get school work done. You can interact with people all over the world. You can also learn about the world around you and that covers less than a fraction of everything you can do on the computers, but don't stay on all day. Make sure you go outside and have a great time too!
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I have same questions for you and I was hoping you could answer them. I was wandering. Do you have any computers in your house, if so how many? Also, do you like using the computer? I am trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because. I want to ask them how do they survive without one!? Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer. You can talk, email, even see people through a computer because now adays everyone has a videcam hooked onto their computer. I want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time your going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen-name to text someone or just go on verizon, at&t, sprine... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restraunt/place on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on histicoral, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers help us everyday. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything. Most of someones life can be saved to the computer. If you have bad handwriting, then you could just type up your paper and hand it in all nice and neat. Like I said before computers are esstential to our present day lives @CAPS3 reading this, I bet you'll agree.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about computers is that they benifet people. they help people when they need it, it gives people entertainment. So that is why computers benifet people. @CAPS1 first reason is that a computer can help people when they need help like for instace if you have to write a paper and you need to look something up such as reseach you can use the computer or if there is a long main cwayshion then you can look up the formula. So as you can see that is why computer benifts people @CAPS1 second resson is that it gives people entertainment, such as myspace, you twitter. And those are social networks, if you like to watch tv. or listen to music there are websites for them also. So that is why I said computers give you entertainmen too. @CAPS1 third resson is that it helps people such as if you in different contries and you can't go see them you to them through instans or web cam. Or if you are home schooled and you dnt see other kids your age that can talk to the on the computer. So as you can see that why I say you can through the computer. So as you can see that is why I say computer are very benifical be cause they give you entertainment they let you communicate and they help people so.

Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People say that technology is affecting everybody left and right. Computers actively help us with our daily lives. It helps us do project for school, let us understand culture around the world, and gives us the ability to talk and connect with friends and family everywhere. Our shool makes us do tons of project and the computer is our main course. If you want to go somewhere far away, you're most likely to research it, and then plan on going. It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook, twitter, and @CAPS3. Computers help us learn and communicate. To start off, as an eight grades, we are prepared to go to high school. Fortunately, it means we do projects, reports, and research on the computer. The computer enables us to find information for a project, or construct a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people use this method for jobs. People do reports on celebrities and famous people from history. Books can't always give the information you are looking for, so they look up that persons name, and they will find our hundred of web sites that give information and photographs of that person. In addition to, computers let you book flights, buy, tax rates. Sometimes, people don't always to go and drive to a local car, so they go online to a website that sells, and they are able to look at all of the features of the car, the price, and mileage. The only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet. They have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want. It can be to go to florida, or it can be a flight to @LOCATION1. If you also how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt. You can even find out how much an average family pays - every year. Computers can be very they resourceful at @CAPS2. It gives capability to do more than you can imagine. Most importantly, computers have created a way for you talk to friends and family around the globe. Facebook and twitter are the new things of the century. Facebook and twitter let you talk to friends, post photos and talk about your personal life. They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. @CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and doesn't have as many cool things. It only let's you talk to friends and that's why no one uses it anymore. People want to be able to do more than just talk. It comes to my attention that computers have over time. Computers these days enable you to talk with friends, do research and projects, and let you book flights and buy cars. Our school's curriculum has many projects and reports. They can be done only by the help of a computer. You can research people and places and or get pictures. You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet. We even have the capability to talk with friends on facebook and twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, " Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. "You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond. (did not finish)

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much. Well, I disagree with this statement. I think the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer also lets you up a leave more a foriegn people and paces. Lastly, computers helps you communicate with others. As recently stated, I think computers are useful because they help with your hand-eye coordination. For example, when you write papers for school or a document for work, you're using the coordination. You didn't even notice how once hang of typing, you tend to move faster. This machine is a beautiful invention please don't take @CAPS1 away!. The computer is also to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people. Another thing that you dont realizes when using a computer is that the you do from someone in your but from long distance places. How would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas? The computer is the quickest way to find out information! Finally, the computer is an important resource because you can chat with your friends. A @CAPS2 researcher showed that computers You can chat @CAPS3, I think computers has affects on all! They teach hand-eye coordination, they teach you about far away places computer lets you chat online with your friends! I @CAPS4 you see the computer the way I do.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the majority of people now posses computers. Computers have greatly advanced society and technology. Some people say that computers have negative effects, but that is not true. Computers have influenced people in many benificial ways. Although some experts want people to use computers less, that technology is required in schools. Kids are fold to type their papers, which lets them finish faster. This faster finish can lead to kids not staying up too late. Then doing homework. That is better for their health. Computers also develop hand-eye coordination which is an essential skill for later in life. In my opinion computers have greatly contributed to technology. They are letting explore place human has ever/could ever go. We can make and distribute item much faster. In addition, computers also let people learn about faraway places about different cultures and different people. Computers can expand everyone's horizons and let them know about places and things that they never knew existed. With are of the largest number of members. Facebook is a website that people use to communicate. More than @PERCENT1 of most students in an average school have one. They communicate there more than they could without computers. Computers aren't making people "anti social" or making them interact with friends less, they're actually talking more. Computers are letting people communicate daily with people from all around, without having to wory about running out of cellphone minutes. Overall, computers are letting people broaden their horizons are lock of new things. They are more of a benefit than a burden. Computers are the next best thing since sliced bread.

Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming to dependant on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active. While some people @MONTH1 think were not wasting our time on the computer. I @CAPS3. I'll should only go on if it is nessesary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people dont realize is that is doesent only waste there time in waste our money too. Electricys bills are trough the roughtAlso instead og going out to meet @CAPS1 people are staying home and talking on social networking sites which make them less social. Children are not enrolling in sports which makes them losse any physical strength they would get. Also children could be getting over wait by just sitting there with no pysical activitys, @CAPS2 ideas like microsoft word is fine but going on every day for games is. Teachers, parent, and all need to show these that the computer is not the only thing, Computers can benifit us very well, by letting us have knoledge of somthing at the tip of our fingers. Computers can and will take away family and friend time. Now im not saying that computer but what am saying is that it effects everyone around you, @CAPS3 just the person thats using it. What @CAPS4 need to @CAPS3 is get together and unite. @CAPS4 need to go outside more, and exersise. @CAPS4 need to stop the computer with adults. Therfore, lets make this a better place. and get out and have a little time for going on to the computer.
<START>

I think that we should have computers. Because it help us find pleopl and it help us talk to peopl and it help you srech thing too I can have a brother that I never knew before then you can find that brother. Then I can talk to my firend online if I go to myspace or @CAPS1 because you can in @MONTH1 be have firend on myspace, and by srech this you can find new thins and you can look up this like weather in a different country or state I can find out how cold it is in taxes and you can srech an up to see how old it can be. Or how old it can get.

Dear fellow citizens, @CAPS1 think if you had to get a book for every question you had. That would take a long time to even get the book let alone read it. Computers have helped the modern world with questions, long distance friends, and entertainment. Computers have helped us with more then those things the @CAPS2 is sucha universal thing that its hard to come up with all of the helpful things it does. For one the @CAPS2 helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them. Sites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 allow us to communicate and/or play with them. @CAPS1 think is the only way to talk with a friend from a different place would be to pick up the phone and call them well your friendship would disappear very quickly. This would happen because no one ever usualy has the time to pick up the phone and talk to the person and do nothing else. Well when you talk to them on the @CAPS2 you can do other things. For example if I wanted to I could talk to someone and the @CAPS2 and clean my room. Further more computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or any else that is entertaining. On the to do I when my brother would let me use the play again. I was but them I @CAPS1 went better A also play movies, @CAPS5 shows videos. If you ever miss a show to watched home of the show and watch it. This could save someone time and effort. Lastly, The computers much more efficient is looking yet things. IT is much faster then looking through the library and you don't have leave your I although people say that the @CAPS2 is taking away time from reading well it really isn't it. For everything you want you can read online or if you really want to you can have the @CAPS2 don't for you. Reading isn't a problem at all. @NUM1 of america believes that computers help greatly and how they have more time to do things is being upgraded every day and it keeps getting better and better. In conclusion I believe that computers are helping us and is not a bad thing. Computers are great for us and good for bussy people. Now go and get a @CAPS2 to.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are several reason how computers have effect on people. My position is to convice the local newspaper why certain people @CAPS2't and @CAPS3 use computers. People getting caught up on the @CAPS4, or people not having enough money to explore the world, so they just be on the @CAPS4. In effect, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you will get caught up. For example, my friend @PERSON1 stay on the computer more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that his on a @CAPS5 line, hooking up with other people. He for gets about everybody. He's so on the @CAPS4. He stop going school, he gaining. Now he just a nobody. He just sit in front of his computer and do nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid @CAPS5 line. @CAPS8's not hard to find another in our city. @CAPS8's alot of beautiful young lady's out here to explore. Similary, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop losing their focus on important, and start paying attention on other things like the, was a great person. She was so successful. She make tons of money. Until she start losing her her job. She stop cause she was so stock on facebook. Facebook is like a place for a friend @CAPS6 you could meet other people from different @CAPS7 you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turn her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now. How she got fired, how she don't pay her bill, and how she moving into a. Sometimes websites make lose focus on important thing in life. Consequently, certain people @CAPS3 use computer because the @CAPS4 help you with certain things. In summation, @CAPS8 help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the @CAPS4. One time I sign up for this website that was called myspace. For moment I did got caught up on @CAPS8. Continue line.

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people. People tend to get moody. and it seems that computers are addictive. I think computers have a huge effect on people. The nubmer one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit inside for most of the day. Also they get so lazy they don't want to get up so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their hause. The next idea is that they do not get enought exersise, because they isn't sit there all day and don't move. But when they do move its to get something to eat or go get their phone. This is why they should limit kids and adults to only @NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day. @CAPS1 next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get . Like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad. They get all couped up inside for the whole day. They don't see enough because people don't see they . If they hour each day the moody ness would change. People need lot of exersise to maintain weight and muscle. @CAPS1 last receson the computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer . Like if they are playing a game all day and don't realize it they will get addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport. In conclusion what I am trying to tell you taht it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer, because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a hgih risk of obesity. So can you please listen to @CAPS1 ideas.

Dear Newspaper, I have been reading about the debate about computers. People say that computers are teaching important skills. Others are saying that, "People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising." @CAPS1, I think that people should be able to use computers (I mean they were ment to help us anyway) @CAPS2 think how much computers have helped the @CAPS3 race, from talking to friends/family in other countries too looking at what time the plane leaves to @LOCATION1. It is said that more one million people and up use there computer more than once a day. Without the compuuter there is no worldwide web witch is connected to everything in this world. Without computers you wouldn't be able to controll any robotic or wich will give more jobs but the cost of food to will go of tramendisly without computers the equipment wouldnt work in hospitals computers can save life they store important information we would have to go back into the dark ages with typewriters again. Another big issue is that people are over useing the computer. Once you learn to moderate the useige of your computer that wont be a problem. Some people say computers cost too much. There are ways to pot so called "down payments" on computers, something like a but you pay each month and setting up internet is easy as @NUM1. So, yes there are good and bad things talked about computers but without them we wouldn't have a modern era. Then controll the robot that makes your to the that saves lifes so with all this said I would lie to say thanks or listening and go computers!

Dear, @CAPS1 I am writting this article on computers to inferm you my oppinun on computers positive and negotive efects. The reason why computers are so succsesful is beacuse of some of the great imformation they. Such as directions to a place until you are going to or home imformation on a subject or a pearson. Althoug these all sound good any one can post imformation on the internet so some imformation misnt not all be accrate. Some reasons why the computer is bud is beacuse of signs wich are not safe and can give your pearsonal imformation to a and comeing back to bud you in the future. Also webite or pop up icon are not suttebul for younger kids and exposeing them to to mature for them. Lastly talking on the computer is apart of our everyday lives such as emails almost every american whita computer here. A email, this is a great to relie or. Also the new sorse of web witch giving you the ability to see peaple and into the computers wich is raipidly growing in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 all in this article this you my point of veiw on computers.

Dear local newspaper, I think that the computer is not a bad thing becase of three resons one reson is that we can learn a bought a faraway place. Another reson is they teach hand-eye coordination. The last reson is we can talk to frteinds and meet new people. From the computer we can learn a bought a faraway place if we were doing a report on it or just our of curiosity. We can learn wat kind of plantation grow there for food for example tropical places grow bananas and cocanuts. We can learn wat they eat like in @LOCATION1 they eat many beans a lot of there food have beans even there salads. We can find out there language as well maybe they talk spanish like in @LOCATION2. You can also teach hand-eye coordination becase it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use ur hands on evry thing while typing wether you are typing or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things it is also for freinds becase of al these sites like myspace, facebook, aim, webchat. The posibilities are endless u can even play games. If you dont know someone on face, book, or myspace thats okay it is a great way to meet new people and new freinds. And another thing if u are having trouble findin freind you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somwhere or something. And for those pepole who think it is taking away family time you can always just say okay thats enough and talk to them. So that is it they are good because u can learn of places, hand-eye coordination, and talk to new and old freinds. so they are good

I believe that the house hold computer can help with every day things like research and developemint, home work, art work, an always renewing travel dictionary, a @NUM1 hour super store filled with never ending items, video games and a very sofistacated colculator. New programs are comeing out all the time but idiction is always seen as a very bad thing to have to do any part of you will start to have no friends or girlfrends and you'll probleay start to egnore your family and you'll get corple tunnle sindram from typeing and focreamea from staring at a brite screen alday and looking at it closely. You will probley get a bad back from siting alday in a chair or neeling or leaning back in a chasse lounge and it @MONTH1 be comfey but it's bad for you, in concloshion computers help a lot and they are fun. But it addicting to so have fun. But don't get addicted because computers @MONTH1 be fun but portions are helthy and thats what should be done.

Dear Readers, @CAPS1 of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people spend to much time on computers, especially teenagers. They spend to much time on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they @MONTH1 talk with friends with @CAPS4, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball. Families also are distant form each other when they sit around on @CAPS5. Teenagers spend too much time on the @CAPS6 going where they should instead of doing more benefitul activities like reading. I sure we all know at least @CAPS1 obese person or teenager. My neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as @CAPS1. He will sit on the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer screen for hours on end. Sometimes I wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second. I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor. The statistic @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2 is obese is not exagrated at all. In my opinion, it is the fault of the @CAPS6 and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless @CAPS5 videos, while they should be playing baseball or football. Doubters say you learn hand-eye cordination with computers, but you can learn better with sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage @CAPS1 to sit around instead of doing standard @NUM1 minutes a day of exercise. The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and @CAPS9 does. I would say that the average gets about @NUM2 minutes of reading a day because they are to busy chating with friends on the @CAPS6. I have a cousin who reads about a book every @NUM3 years and fail every test he gets and has stayed back @NUM4 times, but instead of reading and learning, he is chating and texting. He wastes these excellent educational opportunitys while their are people in underdevolped countries like @LOCATION3 who are lucky to own a book. I know more than @PERCENT2 of the kids in my class do not read anything execpt the required reading and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting @CAPS10 is about @NUM5 and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time on computers spent. I have seen survey that say @NUM6 out of @NUM7 spend more than @NUM6 hours a day on computers. These statistics and quotes have left me thinking, how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading or else we will turn into oversized monkey who can't even rad. The computers and @CAPS6 are doing more than just erasing brain cell and are health, they are taking away the expriences that we could have outside in nature. Nature holds natural wonders like the @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 and the @CAPS13 @CAPS14. What beats sking down a large slope, or climbing the @LOCATION1, certainly not computers. Unfortunatly, that what most @CAPS15 choose to do. They sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches. They sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens, unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves. Instead of taking steps to help the enviorment we are siting on the computers sleeping and being mesmerized by the light of the screen. We should be preserving and learning abouy what is left on the planet, but we are not because of these computes and the @CAPS6. I have present a strong arguement against computers that you @MONTH1 listen to or not. I strongly urge you to take action to start reduce time on computers spent. Set up programs at your house or town for turning off the computers. We need to do something now!
<START>

Dear editor, @TIME1 week, I noticed an article in the paper headlined "@CAPS1 off the computer and go exercise." This caught me off gaurd because there are many benefits to computers, such as it enchances education, you can learn about foreign countries, and you can talk to other people. Every school has a computer. Their easy access and very helpful. I know that @TIME1 year, if someone asked a question and the teacher wasn't sure of it, we would go strait to the computer. It also helps us do better on projects. I know I had to do a project @TIME1, and without the computer I wouldn't have it today. We also use the computers for the programs they have. In art, we made a cartoon, and made it look real with photoshop. It's also easy and fast to use a computer for research. You can also learn ahead far away places with a computer. For example, you can find out about other countries in the world. You could find out if it were landlocked, not landlocked, how many people live there, and facts similar to those. You can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government. Finally, you can also learn up-to-the minute-facts with websites like @CAPS2.com. Lastly, you can talk with other people using email, instant messaging, and websites like facebook, which allows you to connect with friends. With email, you talk with someone for buisness for to recieves links to @CAPS1 to websites, and to @CAPS1 information. Instant messaging is just like texting on your phone, except much faster. You can instantly talk to people and catch up with them. Thousands of people are on facebook. You can connect with old friends, and talk to current ones. I knkow my mom uses facebook and talks to old friends since she moved. So, in my opinion, I think computers are a good thing to have. Not only do they enhance your education, but they also teach us foreighn countries history and let us connect to old friends. When you were in school, do you remember your "best-friend-for-life?" @CAPS3, with facebook you can catch up with them, instead of them being a memory.

Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you know that eight out of ten homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. For others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. The computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a @NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, @ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw. So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curiouse about the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2, if I wanted more inofrmartion @CAPS3 head straight to the computer. You simply go to @ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty. The computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways, wether it is communication organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life. Computers don't just benifit our little town of @LOCATION1, they benifit our whole socoety in all of the amazing things they do.

Computer are good and bad because computers are good because that is a way we can comunicate with other people in different states. Another reason computers are good because they can keep you out of trouble and can keep you entertained. Computers are bad because they can become a computer. Freak and become highper when it comes to computers. Computers are good because it can do alot of things that other objects cannot do.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you can see, about @PERCENT1 of our population over use the computer. They should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends. On the other hand, the computer can come with much use. For many people. Family lives quite a distance away, @CAPS1 well @CAPS1 some friends and getting out of touch is a possibility. You can also learn about far away places, like @LOCATION1. The computer is often used for projects essays which is important. You can learn quite a bit with a computer. The computer can be used in many ways. One way is to keep in contact. Sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody live that close. For people who have relatives or even good friends who live quite a distance, a computer is what you @CAPS2. It is a great way to keep in contact. You can keep everyday updated at all times. For example, my cousin recently went out of the country for college she will be there for a few months so she has her own blog on the computer to keep everybody update and stay in contact. The phone is not always an option. To learn about far away places is great. Online you can learn about the history of specific places. You can see the towns and so much more. You can even see pictures. Maybe one day you will even get to see those specific places in person. How cool would that be? School is a big thing now-a-days. Students have project after project assay after essay and its a lot of work. @CAPS1 you grow older it becomes more work and with a computer, you will have less weight on your shoulders. With essays you can type them, and fix your mistakes without it looking sloppy. Projects are easy to fix to: so messing up isn't a big deal. On the other hand, more americans now than ever before are over weight. The computer has a lot to do with that. Most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening. They don't realize what a big effect a computer can make on a person. More people should be out exercising. Spending time with family. Computers can be negative thing or positive. It can be more helpful than you could imagine. But, yet it can make a huge negative effect on people. It can help keep contact with people to learn about far away places, or even school work. Let it be benificial, use it when you @CAPS2 it.

Dear Newspaper, Computers benefit society because they teach people. They are also helpful because they solve problem that humans might have trouble with. They can also entertain us when we have nothing to do. They can teach people many things. They can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to. Actually @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 tourist research the area there going to on a computer. They help students catch up or fully understand something. One time I was having trouble with fraction, in math. So I decided to look up the way to find the answer and it caught me up with the class again. The computer can explain cultures from any where in the world. According to culture digest.com @PERCENT1 of people visiting a new country. Find out about the culture first. Computers solve problems that some people might not now about. It can solve a math problems easily with a built in calculator. @NUM3 out @NUM4 computer users have used calculator to help them solve a problem. They also solve geographic problems. There @MONTH1 be an about of date map but this is easily solved with live satelite maps. Map tools says there has never been a flaw in their system. Computers have a wide viarety of entertainment. They can play music. @PERCENT2 of teens get there music from the computer over a cd. Computers can entertain you with games. One day it was raining hard and I had nothing to do so I went on my computer and played minesweeper. This kept me very entertained. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for time.

More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Well, to me it does benefit society in many ways like, learning online. You can learn many things online, you can practice math, reading, and even writing. You can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do. Also, you can interact with friends and family members, by email etc. When your online you can learn alot of things. If your at home, and you need to study for a test, you can go online and study. You can also learn more, because you can learn how to do a math problem if you don't know it, or just catch up on reading. People sometimes need a computer because they might be bored, so they can go online and play games and have fun. People, especially kids get bored at times, so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivias so they can still learn. Computers can let you interact with your family and f riends. You can e-mail or webcam. if yopu haven't talk to someone a long period of time you can just go to the computer and talk to them. If you want to find a @CAPS1 school classmate that you haven't talked to in years, you can now. Computers do benefit the society, In my own opinion we do need computers. If parents do not want their child on websites they don't approve of, the parents can always block those websites. Computer are really nessacary they can help in a huge way.

Being a teen myself, my computer is something I don't think I would be able to live without. But is it holding me back from more important things? I think so. I feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now. For example with school research papers we imediatly go to the computers in order to find information when we could be using books and magazeens. With having the use of computers many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books. Also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment. For many people using a computer is a life style, it's something we tend to use more than religiously and that @MONTH1 not be the best thing. Children, teens and even adults get extremly addicted to computers. Teens and children use laptops and @CAPS1's everyday in order to do their school work, and to talk with friends. As well as parents/adults, they use it to get their work done and use it as a easy communication with co-workers. To this very day people have become very addicted to computers. I know for certain that in my family, my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. As I mentioned before computers are also pulling families further apart. There is less family time and comunication between family members these days, due to computers. Insead of spending time with the family, teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends. I bet if there was a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers I almost garentee it would be quite a large amount. I know the only true family time some families have without computers is dinner and that isn't much. Lastly many humans are not as connected to nature and as involved as they used to be. Using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature. Though there many advertisements and pop ups on the computer that inform us about how to take care of the earth properly, we so easily ignore them and remain playing on the computer than going outside and doing something to help make the world a better, clearer place. Not only is it just taking care of our earth, but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should. Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but I bet a great deal of it is. Like I said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer, I mean how would we communicate or do our work? But there are trulthfully other ways to do them that we just aren't very used to because of the fact that we are so attatched to them. I never really noticed till now that it is possible to live without a computer, and that so many people are missing increadable things such as family and nature because we are so addicted to the computers.

Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion I belive that computers have helped our society a lot over the past decade or so. This is because when you on the computer you get better hand-eye coordination. Also you learn how to type and do other things with a computer that you will need to no how to do if you want to get a decinte job that pays well. Also now on the computer you can go on facebook and other website were you can make friend and chat with other people. So its not only helping your social skills and hand-eye coordination but also you are most likly to get a good job if you no how to type and use a computer. First off, having a computer teaches you to have better hand-eye coordination. This is because when you get a computer having better hand-eye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quick. Secondly, having a computer will teach you better social skills. This is because now alot of people go on facebook and you can make friends and chat with your new ones. Also when its a cold and rainy day you can occupy youself by playing different games and also you can check the news and forecast for tommorrows weather. Lastly, when you learn how to type you have a good shot at getting a good job because you no hot to type and work a computer. This is because when you are looking for a job that pays good you will most likly have to me how to type and operate a computer. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, in my opinion I think computers have helped our society over the years, but other people @MONTH1 think differently. So now lets see what you think.
<START>

Click, click, click the mouse of a computer goes as you are searhcing throughout the internet. Computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, I believe that computers have a very positivr effect on people. Computers can touch kids to be social because first off computers are like an online phone, you can talk to people in so many ways, facebook caht, aim(chat),, myspace, twitter, skype, and a lot of others ways that i havent mentioned. Also I think is a teen or kid or even adult that is too nervous to talk to people on the phone or in person, and is socialy not their or painfully shy can start of by just chatting with people online. Once they feels more comfoatable, then they can start talking to the person on the phone or in person. For example, I once @MONTH1 this girl who was very sweet, but was painfully shy and everyone for it, so one day she decided to make an aim nad talk to poeple on it, and provove that she isn'e a annoying wherd girl that everyone makes her out to be. She turned out to be one of the nicestly funniest person I ahve hung out with in a while. Which how internet can help you. HAve you ever felt that computers sometimes make you more intellegent? Well, in my opinion I think that computers help out so much more than a book. If you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button. Ahving a computer is like your own personal handbook of veerything in the world. A lot of people these days study from the internet, I know I sure do. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 more people say, that computers are more helpful than books and can make you a lot more intellegent, because the internet has so much more deatil than books, and mor efacts. @PERCENT2 of kids that have a computer use it for homewrok. Computers is a great tool to use while you are doing your homework. I spend most of the day on my computer doing homework than off it. For example, say you have a report and you need facts on @CAPS1 @PERSON1, and where he was born. You would jus type in, "when was @ORGANIZATION1 boen." and born! There it is with the date exactly. Also if you having a piece of writing like your rough draft so why spend the time trying to write really neat and perfect? When you can just open up a word document and type it up. To sum everything up computers have deffenatly a positive effect on people from these three reasons, computers are a great way to teach kids hohw to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, But I understand where your coming from people are spending way to much time on their computer and less time exersising, but you can look up great ways to exersise on the internet and watch videos of people that have @CAPS2.V shows about exersising and do it with them on the computer.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am here to prosoade you to agree with me on, that the use of computers does benift society. Some reasons why I think this are school work and business stuff. Also the over all reasearch on important things. My first reason why I think that computer use is benifiting society is because @CAPS6 is oftenly used for school work. In example use @CAPS6 for projects. Also some type of reasearch they might be interested in. But one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because, there are a lot of people taking online classes. Wheather its for college or for the sake of your own learning. This is why I think school work shoud be a valid reason for benifiting society. My second reason why I think @CAPS6 benifits our society is the business or job part of the computer. Many people, @CAPS7 a days work at home, they have their own office. They all most create their own company. Another reason is many people also use "@CAPS4 @CAPS5" or publisher. @PERCENT1 of the people who work at public businesses do this, going along with ads, when could also or another reason for this. But then again, you could @CAPS7 pay your bills on line! I remember when I helped my mother pay on of the bills online, and let me tell you, "@CAPS6 was easy!". My mother said she do @CAPS6 more often @CAPS7 that she knows how to use @CAPS6!" @CAPS7 the business side should be more then enough, for me to convince you. My last reason is over all reasearch on all important things. Some of these important things are: online catalogs, the news and another one the most important things of all job openings. I know my self, and I love to shop! So instead of leaving the house, I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store called "@CAPS8". The main reasons why I go online is b/c they have more variety and sizes. @CAPS7 for the news, thats all for my parents b/c i don't watch the news. Lastly, job openings @CAPS7 that I am @NUM1, I would like to find a job, even if its mimumum wage. @CAPS6's still something, right? This should be a high priced reason for agreement! In @CAPS9, I think my @NUM2 reason are very well clear; school work, business, and over all reasearch. If these reasons don't convince you I dont know what will!?

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 a family. Just a normal family whose lives have been changed due to computers. They are overweight, constantly suffering from fatigue, lonely, nature deprived and lazy. However, they could of turned out differently if they just shut down their computers. They might of healthy. fit, energetic, radiant, hardworking people if they had stopped spending hours on the computer daily. Although there are some positive computers can be dramatic. They isolate you from friends and family, they deprive you of the nature around you, and most of all, they @MONTH1 cause you to become overweight or even obease. Friends and family are two very important things in everybody's life, even if you dont realize it. By using computers rather than interacting with them, you are the connections you have. Computers @MONTH1 cause you to isolate yourself. They might cause you to talk to your . Unfortunatley, friendships can be . "Spending long hours on my computer had caused me to become . made me fell lonely, @PERSON1, @NUM1, says @CAPS2, by the use of computers you are doing yourself a favor. Computer can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you. You most likely would be on you ocmputer rather than going outside. Instead of spending countless hours on the computer, you could be playing a sport or activity. By playing sports you are increasing you hand eye coordination, far more then if you were to be on a computer. Wouldnt you like to be having funs with your friends playing vollyball, basketball, swimming or even going rather then sitting infront of your computer? I know I would! The obesity rates of this country will increse if people continue to use computers. You will rize about @PERCENT1 from lack of exersize. Computers can ruin lives by increasing your chance of becoming unhealithy overweight. So now think, would you want to be lonely, overweight, and deprived of nature? I know i definiely wouldn't. why computers should be used less frequently! So hows the time; lets join together and raise awareness of the negitive effects of computer!

Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reason why I am against usage of computers. My @NUM1 reason why I am against usage of computers is, the negativity, like for example too many pop ups come on the website your own and then they mini little advertisments like "@CAPS1 on me" "free trial". And thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My seocnd reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called "@CAPS2". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier thats not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is montoring, alot of parents dont watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inapproiate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fought beacuse they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dont always know what your clicking on and you can @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. So just have my opinions and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks.

Statistics show that more and more people every year are not geting their exercice and are on the computer talking to their frend on face book or my space or something like that. Will people go out side more or will they sit and type? Here is the @CAPS1 more and more people use computers, but not every one agrees that this benifits society. Those who suport advasas in tecnollogy belive that computers have a positive afect on peoples life. Well I @CAPS2 belive that it does not have a positive ofect on people. My reasons are that people who youse computers more dont get their exercise and get fater, and if you put Your name and adress on the computer their is a slite @CAPS3 that you will be kidnaped or murderd, my final reson is that you dont spend as much time with the familiy that you should. Obiseity in the @LOCATION1 has gone up at least @PERCENT1 because people arent geting thir exercise and are spending to much time on the computer @CAPS4. nothinka says that: "Their are to meany People who dont get the exercise They need." The @ORGANIZATION1 says "@CAPS5 people like the internet but what people dont know is that thir are @CAPS5 bad people out their who whould like to get thir hands on your info." @CAPS6 as you can see I @CAPS2 belive that it whould be a wise idea if you wrot a articol on tecnology. Because @ORGANIZATION1 obesity in america and @CAPS8 safty it is now or never that You wriet this articol it will probobly mack you hunders @ORGANIZATION1 dollers @CAPS6 get out @ORGANIZATION1 your @CAPS9 pick up your pencil and write. @CAPS5 people thik that Computers are fun yes but You are not reolisinig what Your doing.

@CAPS1, @CAPS1 boom, bom! Those are the noises of pinball on my computer. @CAPS2! Yea we won". Those are noises you don't want to be hearing all day. Always being on your computer is bad for your health. @CAPS5 you are a computer freak you will become overweight, it's bad for your eyes, and you can't enjoy beautiful nature. "@CAPS3 you want to be so heavy that you can't even lift yourself out of bed? I don't think so. @CAPS5 you are always sitting at the computer desk then you might be like that. @PERCENT1 of doctors say that @CAPS5 you don't get up from the computer desk you will become obese! Being obese is terrible for your health. It can take years off your life. @CAPS5 you want to live a long healthy life you need to get up from the computer and exercise. "@CAPS4 I think I need a stronger, my eye are getting worse! @CAPS5 something like this has ever happened tp you it's because your your eyes to at the computers screen all day. @PERSON1 says, "@CAPS5 you are at the computer all the time you will need glasses or a stronger." @CAPS6 and children need to get away from their computers. studies show that more adults are on computers, playing games than children. Have fresh, healthy eyes and get away the computer. The acroos your chill. in your right ear. The sun giving you the most beatiful tan. @CAPS3 you like the sound of this? Take away from your computer and go outside. This is the amazing experience you can get from going outside. @CAPS5 you sit at the computer screen maybe you can watch someone else enjoying the great, relaxing experience you shoud have. Get up, get active and go outside. Now is the time to get up from your computer. @CAPS5 you haven't learned, the computer is an unhealthy thing for humans to use. Be like me and get rid of your computer. You need to be healthy and most of all active. Have good eyes and enjoy nature. Don't use the computer."

Currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. Some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. However, I tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. People exploit most of their time on comptuers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? Many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism. This is one reason why the @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pair you'll recieve, you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercise. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we @MONTH1 learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our frinds in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1. Our families need help occasionally, but sometime we're not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. In conclusion, computers hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends.

Dear editor, I have heerd about me advance in technology dispute. I would like to say their I think it does benef it our society. I think this because: You can communicate with friends, they help you with school and a reliable resource for you need to find. Please read on so I can explain my reasons. Computers and technology benefit us in many ways. One of mom's they able you to talk to friends. Computers give you an easy and fast way to communicate with others. Instead of sending a boring letter that takes forever to get there, you can hook up with your friends, you haven't seen in a while. I remember when my friend moved to @LOCATION1. It would of taken me forever to there, so instead I went online and talked to him. Also, lastly, it less your hand. Now please read on for my second reason. My second reason . Computer are a of looking in many different take days. You can go online and find everyone, in ten minutes. In fifth grade I had to do this really hard project. I looked in books @NUM1 days and find. But then looked up everything I needed to known in an half hour. Lastly, they have more success. If you go on in @ORGANIZATION2 you could find hundreds of on one topic. Easy right? New read on for reason. My last and strongest reason that technology can help you find anything in everyday life. Computers can help you find your way. They supermarket for you. They can help with anything. One year I went on vacation to @LOCATION2. my mom move. So got lost help. Na, if we gotten difference have nevir pickel. Wouldn't you be more confident if you had ? Computers can a lso find for places for you an your friends or family to have fun like it couldn't find places never heard of. Such as @ORGANIZATION1. Now need on so can all up. So, as you can see technology, benefits our society in a big way. Mostly in these three reasons: You can communicate with your friends, they help you in school, and they are a reliable source for everybody life. i hope you have enjoyed rading this. Please take this info your next . thank you for your time, and thank you for reading my paper.

In my opinion i think that computers help people. It helps them with imformation that they @MONTH1 need. It can also help learn a lot of things.

I believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a stronger positive one. Computers these days are very advanced and allow you to talk to your friends, allow you to acess information more efficiently, and have increased our man power in scientific research. Almost every teen has a screen name that allows you to chat online with your friends. This function keeps kids in touch and active. Eventhough instant messaging can distract kids from their daily life it can also be amazingly helpful. Just last week a friend of mine had forgotten to write down their homework and easly contacted online. I was able to let them know @NUM1 a matter of seconds. Like wise, with this online communication you can also talk and and video chat as if you right there with your friends not everyday do you get to go hang out with your friends so this is an easy alternative. Not only is quick and easy it's free. Computers keep kids off their phones and from jucking up the bill and causing those loud annoying phone bill conversations how to limit your texting. The most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information. The internet allows people to acess millions of websites and light speed. Every second of the day their is someone on the internet searching for date that they would have to go to the library to get. Computers are a key part in society and we depend on them without them we would all be lost. They provide an easier way to life that us lazy @CAPS1 need to survive. The internet keeps us updated and informed on whats going on all around the world without even going there. We need the internet and we couldn't acess it without computers. One of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research. Computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date. Recently I was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for @CAPS2 a process that would take a human weeks. They also help us be different and more creative people. With the computer came smaller more compact computers till they were able to fit in the palm of our hand. They have lead us to think we can do greater things in life and keep our earth safe and to stop damaging it as much. They're lead us to research the unknown areas of the world where @NUM2 years ago a scientist with a pad of paper didn't have dare to even think about. Computers have linked the world through communication and information and have exelled us to greater heights in understanding how we came to be. Overall society needs computers and they have and overwhelming positive affect on society.

Many computers that people have they use it everday right? Most of them be on it from the time they get off of work or out of school until it's time for them to go to bed. What I think they should to is find some other activity to do instead of sitting on the computer for six hours and not doing nothing with their life and plus at that when you look at a computer for so long you can mess up you eye sight. Why be on the computer all day when you can go outside and get some fresh aire? Why would you wanna be on the computer when you have family and some friends you could be spending time with and taken care of? You don't want to be lazy and not do nothing for yourself. You wanna be able to go for a walk instead of being cooped up in the house on the computer. Why would you even wanna be on the computer when you could have fun going out to eat or to an place you always have wanted to go your whole entire life? You can't always depend on a computer when you wanna go out and explore something new you have to try it out yourself to really see whats the whole thing about. You don't want to have a boring life now do you? Cause that's what it seems like by you sitting around on the computer everyday looking of a bunch of @NUM1-since you wanna do what you want to do and have fun by doing what you like to do. It's not easy finding a job or planing to go out far away by looking on the computer because you have to click a lot of numbers or pictures to go threw what you wanna get to when you can go and do it yourself by looking for better and other things to do.

Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do comently. People will be doing much better things, such as exercising or spending more time with family and friends. Both these things are better for people's body and mind, and one more useful later in life. Please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on computers. First, exercising is an exellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer. By cutting out at least some @ORGANIZATION1 these hours, people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 says that "@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone." @CAPS2 some free time being on the computer is taken away, people will reward themself by taking care @ORGANIZATION1 their bodies. Moreover, I tried not using my computer for a week, and it was a great experience because in that free time I learned how to do a back flip in gymnastics. There are so many possibilities in exercising @CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much. Second, @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on the computer, they get more experience with social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 says "@CAPS2 people spend time with family and friends, they gain necessary social skills for later in life." A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick-thinking skills. Spending time with people's family and friends in stead @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer is exremely beneficial. I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them. Clearly, it is better to spend less time on the computer, and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends. Some people @MONTH1 say people can talk to people online so this is social skills, but in fact people gain better social skills from person-to-person interactions because they must use quick thinking and their emotions too. Altogether, I strongly believe spending less time on the computer is the best way to stay heathy mentally and physically. Thank you for considering my opinion.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 recently has been brought to my attention that computers have been affecting peoples daily lives. i do agree with this because with our countries of obesity. More people need to exercise more, interact with freinds, and to just enjoy things that don't involve technology. Some people are just super glue to computers, but let's see if @CAPS3 doesn't start wearing down after this paper. Many individuals are spending too much on their computer and less time working out or exercising. People need to start spending more time on exercising and less time on their computer due to the facts that more and more states obese percents just keep rising. Yes, you @MONTH1 say I will just go on a diet ino! Diets don't always work and many people have tned them. Even a simple one hour walk with your dog is better than lazily browsing the web. And if you wanted, you could even join the local gym for @MONEY1 a month. Buttle only way this is going to happen is by you wanting to do so. Now you know how to fix your problem, get going! More people need to interact with friends instead of going on their computer. Interacting with friends or family will help themm be better with their social hucs in all. Yes, maybe your friends and family out and hungry with your friends most likely you will have more fun exercising then you have on the computers. By interacting with friends and family will help youn later in life by being more social and ready any job interview to meet you less nervous. F inally, enjoying things that don't involve technology is good to know because many people don't have as much fun out in the real world. You have to mete @CAPS3 fun. This can be schevered by asting a frend to go on a compy trip with ypu or spending a little diugh to enjoy yourself. The ourdoors and nature consists of many beautiful and awesome things; but the only way to realize this id to have fun outside or explore whats the great tourst. In conclusion, many people's lives are being manipulated by computers and destroying their daily live. but maybe due to these essy tips; excrsing more, by soul.

@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online.

The use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented. Although there are some upsides to computers like doing research and interacting with people, there are @CAPS1 more bad aspects then good ones when it comes to computers. Computers negatively affect the way people live outside the "virtual world." @CAPS1 people end up overweight or obeise from spending too much time in a computer chair and not enough time outside exercising. People also tend to interact with people on the computer that they don't talk to out in the world, or that they don't know at all. People also give out personal information to people they don't know, which leads me to my second point. Thefts happen everyday across the globe, whether it's robbing a bank, a store, or even someone's identity. Using a computer can lead to @CAPS1 thefts. There are people that hack into people's banking account, which has all your personal information on it, and withdraw any sum of money tha they like. Millions of people have all of their information online, for anyone to see, and this is very dangerous. That is another downside to computers. My final point that is to be made is all the costs that come with computers. @CAPS1 people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time. Some people even must pay for rehab. There are people out there who are actually addicted to the internet, so they have to pay thousands of dollars to get back to health. As you can see, there are @CAPS1 more cons than pros when it comes to computers. Any of these things could happen to you so I advise you not to use a computer.

Studys have shown that @NUM1 out of the @NUM2 have improved hand-eye coordination. Also it help kids @CAPS1 that it stimulates the nerves in the hands and brain for kids that have had sergery on there hands. Last years study has shown that @PERCENT1 of kids have improved hand movement faster than regular therpy. Secondly. The importance of computers have been commucation like email or aim. This @CAPS1 great for penpals because it saves time for responses from mail and money because there @CAPS1 no mailing to places and when you email them there will be a fast responce. Also this will help people that are shy around people. A study has shown that @PERCENT2 of shy kids have increased the talkative skills in school. Also most talkative skills will help kids today with there confidence. Finaly, the computer @CAPS1 a helpful knolage tool to use.

Dear Newspaper I disagree with the hole computer thing I think it's just a wast of money and it's a wast of time for kids. That will be the kids will get fat and kids will never want to go out side they will want to play video games, eat junk food. If you stay on the computer for to long, it can make your eyes week and it sometimes can give you canser and you can die from canser or you can get really sick and not die and you will hike @NUM1 sick year of pain. Mostly kids stay on the computer for mores playing stupid games and they will never go out side and they will stay in side for days and never go out side and play with there friends. When they get sick of there games they will want to try and hang out with there friends but they wont be able to they will be to fat and slow. My aunt died from useing a computer to much she had brain cancer and she died she lived for @NUM2 year with the cacer. I felt so bad for my cousin he had to watch his mother die all because she used a computer everyday cause that has her job. Therefor I state that computers should not be used for more than @NUM2 houre a day

Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top @NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of @LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to american history.com to find good information about @CAPS1 alley @CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from @CAPS3.C @CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There was my @NUM1 main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, online schools, and online shopping stores. This can help people understand computers.

Dear @CAPS1 news editors, @CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the technological item to have over the past @NUM1 or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! However some experts believe that people spend to much time on computers, and that people are not as active or healthy because of it, and. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are employed as of @DATE1, and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs, or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work (or school) much more work can be done, with programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 people can type reports, and with programs like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2, and iCalculator, workers can calculate taxes faster, so they have more time to work. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! You can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell, without raising you phone bill from calling the brokers. Laptops make work possible on the go to! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs, and other skills you @MONTH1 need times in life. You can learn typing, work programs, and programing which are all needed in some lines of work. Computers increase math skills and hand eye coordination to! And you can read your favorite books via online scans!, now you @MONTH1 be wondering why not pick up a real book? Well, you can’t online scans, and some are free! Not only do computers teach skills and work, they are very fun too! Between @CAPS6, twitter, email, googleBUZZ, mySpace, ooVoo, skype and gamesradar, there are lots of ways to talk to friends and meet new people. On @CAPS6 I can have up to @NUM2 people talk to whenever I want! Why not talk to real people? you ask, well the answer is simple, maybe it is a lazy @DATE2 and nobody wants to go out anywhere, or maybe your friends want to talk right before bed time. Talking to real people is important, but can’t be done all the time! Online gaming has become an sensation!, and not only an @NUM3, @NUM4 and @CAPS8, @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 can “game” too! So many people are gaming now, that if your not, you are missing out on an amazing experience. Some people think gaming is a waste of time, but the same can be said for any indoor leisure activity, everybody needs a fun activity they can do anytime! Besides everybody likes having fun! Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making @LOCATION1 into fat, lifeless losers, but, it is opposite, you can socialize online and meet new people. People (like myself) can balance computers and games, with exercize and sports. With computers you can efficently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are posotive if used correctly. I hope you like this artice, thanks for reading.

Dear sir, I belive that computers are great for society. There are lots of benefits to having a computer to use. You can talk to people online with instant message, it is a lot more dependable than a telephone or cell phones. Lots of time people don't answer thhe phone when you need them. With a computer you can send a message from the computer to the persons cellular device. You can lern a lot from a computer, suc as things about the world, people around the world, yo can lern things from the internet youre teacher can't even teach you. Then you can study and expand youre knolage. It is a problem if your on the computer more than you exersize but with techology today you can get exersize wile useing a computer. You can play music from it while you workout, of what moivie while running on a tredmill. Even though people go on the computer to much ways to exersize and use the computer at the same time. So there is ups and downs but in the end, it dosen't matter how much you use the computer, you can get exersize at the same time thats why I think it is a benifits to have computers today.

Recently, there has been debate about whether or not computers benefit society. Although each side has its own reasons, computers do have a positive effect on people and on society. Computers are beneficial in several ways. With the use of computers, you have the ability to research and learn about foreign and local places you are able to communicate with others and the help people complete everyday tasks. At one point in everyone's lives, you need to know about local or even foreign places. It is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about. This is where computers come in. Over the internet, you can research everything from the main staple of the diet in @LOCATION3 all the way to the day the new year in @LOCATION1. You learn about things in the comfort of your home, or of your home town. I rember once in @NUM1 grade I had to do a research project on @LOCATION2. By going on the computer, I learned all I needed to know and they some. The project was a breeze, and I got a perfect score. Also, you can learn about local upcoming events, and about the world around you. During childhood, every kid has many questions, some their parents might not be able to answer. Using the computer is a quick and easy way to get these answers. Computers help educate the minds of people and without them, we might not know anything. Communicating with people on the other side of the world is difficult. Mailing a letter could take weeks to reach the recipiant. Computers provide us with a imediate method of communicating with others whether they are local or far away. Last year, my uncle moved to @LOCATION3 for work. I never got to see him.We communicated with each other over computers, and when he came home for christmas, we were as close to each other as we were before he work. Computers kept our relationship healthy and I do not think it would have been that way without them. Scientists say that about @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 have communicated with someone at least once through computers. They also say that @PERCENT2 of these people regurally use this method of communicating. Although we still use phones and "shall mail", I do not believe that our society would be able to function socially without the availiable use of computers. Everyday, computers are helping people get through their days with minimal problems. People get things done quicker, giving people more time to do what matters most, interacting with their families. Without computers, everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life. @PERSON1, my neighboor, said "@CAPS2 and banking are so time consuming. I do not know that I would be able to handle it without the ability to do my banking online." In addition to takes and hancing, computers help with everything from shopping to woking for the perfect phone company to use for your new business. Having the ability to shop and browse online takes away ariving, walking and checkout line time letting you relax and take your time throughout the rest of your day. Typing also gives you hand-eye coordination without it, you wouldn't be able to do everyday things such as opening the door to playing sports outside with your children using computers helps people get through their lives easier and more efficiently, I could not even imagine life without them. Computers benefit the people of society in every possible way. By helping them obtain knowleage, purifying and strengthening relationships through constant communication ability, and helping make their everyday lives easier, they have a purely positive effect on people everywhere. Computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study. I think that people don't spend a lot of time on the computer. And even if they are it's for studying learning of catching up with old friends. Here are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. Most kids use computers to learn about things they are doing in class. And they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on. Also there are games on the computer that can help you with math. Now onto my secod reason. You can also use the computer to send emails to friends that live faraway, and also you could use things like facebook to find friends that had moved away. And you could also use a video camera to video chat with a friend or if you are a business man or woman you could videochat with clients all across the country. Now onto my third and final reason. Computers also have applications like microsoft word which lets you type things such as essays or term papers instead of having to write them out by hand. Also there is an application that lets you make a powerpoint if you need to make one for a project. And there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures. Those are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. If we didn't have computers the world would be very different like kids wouldn't be able to search things for projects or type essays. And you wouldn't be able to keep contact with someone who moved away. Also you wouldn't be able to make power points for projects. And that is why I think computers have a good effect on people.

Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think computer are one of the most @CAPS3 inventions ever. They help education make everything @CAPS4 and traveling is @CAPS4. It helps education because @CAPS5 always use computers to help kids learn important information. for example if we have to study for something there are websites specialy made for studing. Also there are sites to teach little kids how to read or write. Allmost all @CAPS5 have computers these days. Some @CAPS5 even give computers to kids so they can use it to study. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 in the @CAPS7.S use computers more than textbooks and get high test scores. Thats why computers help education. A second reason is it generally makes everything @CAPS4. For example instead of writing an essay for school and having it take hours than your hand is and to findout its filled with miss-spelled words. Instead you can type it quick and use spell check. I have never heard one person say that the computer hasn't make life @CAPS4. Another example is if you had to find some information on you new dog. Instead of goind to your library spending minutes.You can simply open up you internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds. That's why the computer make every thing @CAPS4. The last reason is that one. Traveling is such a without a computer With out it you have to go to to buy tickets. In fact I don't even remember what it was like to not @CAPS9 online with a computer all you have to do is go to the parts websites and then but it from there its so easy areselfs to places but traveling mail to each other also. I haven't sent a @CAPS8 card in years. Instead I @CAPS9 email. It quicker, @CAPS4 and more reliable. That is why traviling people and mail is @CAPS4. Over all the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgraing daily soon it will be even @CAPS4 to do things. While too much computer is bad and people souldn't @CAPS9 interact with internet. The computer games in handy almost all the time. That is why i think the computer is @CAPS3.

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1. There has been lots of talk and arguments about computers and wether they benefits the society. I belive it does benefit society. One reson is because you can communicate with others. Another reson is theirs many things to do on these computers or even the world wide web. Haveing computers is always handy. You can talk or web chat with friends. This one time online I found my old friend from @LOCATION1, that I havened seen in five years. Whenever I come home from school I'll go on the computer and talk to all my friends. The computers a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies. My next reson for why they benifit society is theirs so much to do. It's like an at home amusment park. The internet is a wonderfull thing. either to do home work or play games. even some @ORGANIZATION1 I'll just sit down for two or three hours and just play a game. But, i still exercise daily. yes, computers can get addicting but, its always good to go outside and exersise. Many people say over @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS1. population has a computer, and @PERCENT2 check email or go on the computer every ten minutes. yes its not heathy but its their dissition. In conclution I belive computers are indeed benifical. I have stated many resons why. such as, They are great for communication or @CAPS2 up with some friends, also theirs an infinint amount of things to do. So if you don't have a computer go out and get one. They will be worth your wild.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, The average american uses the computer at least once, everyday @CAPS2 machines definetley beneffit society, with then people can easily learn about faraway places, learn whithout having to carry heavy books and papers and chat with people all over the country and sometimes even the world. First of all computers can teach you all about the world without you having to go to a library appart for a book free sites like wikapedia provide fast knowledge and most anything, you can use @CAPS2 sites for essay, trip planning and just to satisfy your curiousity some people believe that computers @CAPS13 people from excersizing and enjoying nature however computers promote exercise and going out to look at nature computers provide quick and easy access to travel agencies, as well as information on popular tourist areas, in any reason, They also bring advertising sites for gyms and ideas on excersizing at home, Computers don't hinder workouts and nature walks, they make @CAPS6 easier to do them. But computers make other things easier as well, @CAPS3 can be much easier with the use of computers, @CAPS4 of dragging around heavy books, @CAPS5 can carry a small laptop; @CAPS5 also can @CAPS13 worrying about keeping track of papers. Everything can be saved to a laptop. Computers organized files so even a messy student can keep organized, another advantage is that anything typed on a computer is neat and easy to understand @CAPS9 some handwriting, @ORGANIZATION2 in @ORGANIZATION1 is an example of how schools can be simplified with laptops. Each @CAPS5 is given one to use @CAPS4 of books, "@CAPS6 is so much easier" said one student. @CAPS3 is very difficult for some kinds. Computers can make @CAPS6 simplier. My last argument is that people can talk to anyone using chat sites. if someone has a cousin distance country they can still keep in touch @CAPS6's the sam for a friends who moved. @CAPS10-mail is a lot faster than @CAPS7 @CAPS8 mail carriers taking a @CAPS10-mail from one person to another is almost instantanious @CAPS6 is also more private, @CAPS9 mail that is just sealed with give, @CAPS10-mails are pass word protected, there are also other sites that are for socializing, @CAPS11 messages also for People talk with one another, This can help people learn about culture in other cities, @CAPS12 and sometimes even Different countries, @CAPS2 sites can help close the gap between cultures, They can help get video racism they can help make the world more ideal. Computers make our comunity better, They let us learn about faraway places, make @CAPS6 easier to enjoy @CAPS3, and enable us to talk to other people from almost anywhere, so, @CAPS13 anything about, You'll realize computers @CAPS14 are benificial to our society.

Computers are the future. Computers are the best technology we've created. They allow us to improve our hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway people and places and what with our friends. Computers improve our hand-eye coordinations typing is a good way to improve this vital skill by not looking and knowing which buttons are where. Using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand. This can improve foster writing, because you are moving the friend in your hand the same way you would move a mouse or type. This can also help driving, because you can't look at the wheel, you have to keep your eyes on the word, and in order to do that you most know how you're moving the wheel. Computers can help hand-eye coordination which can help with writing and driving, with typing and and moving a mouse. Computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places, and people. Cultures come in a variety we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home. We can also learn about nature from our home. Learning about different cultures can teach us many things. Like what kind of clothes they wore, food they ate, place the, lived in. This allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others. Learning about new places can help broaden the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation. Lastly, computers allow us to internet with friends from our chairs. Chatting, and e-mailing and video chatting are all great ways to interact. With a webcam you can even see the other person as if you here face-to-face with them. You can also e-mail important files, such as pictures, docucuments, and even videos. This can help with someone's job. In conclusion, computers can teach us hand-eye coordination, can teach us about faraway places and people, and lets us interact and share with friends. Computers are a very important part of my life.

Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology belive that computers have a positive affect on people like me. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they even allow people to talk online with other people. I will tell you why we should benifit these computers. The first reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination. You can learn how to type really fast. Without hand-eye cordinatoin how are you supose to hit a ball coming at you with a bat, how are you supose to catch a ball with your hands? The second reason is you can learn about far away places and people. Like how we are in the @LOCATION1 and we want to learn about @LOCATION3 or say that we are in france and we want to know about the german people are look it up we dont go all the way down there jest to see the german people we look it up. Now think about it you jest going to fly there and come back the same day. The last thing is you can talk online to anybody you want from africa to the us all the way to @LOCATION2. So you see computers are really speacial becus you see you dont want to write someone amillion things it is not right so we need computers.
<START>

Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend to much time on their computers. I belive people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death. First of all there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer to much. When they are out with their family they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a non-stop amount of time. In a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say, "I had one child come into @CAPS3 office and he had the hardest time seeing". He asked the kids mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, "@CAPS3 son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer." The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses aare really expensive. I have read about children and adults deing from using the computer to much. They have fried their brain from using the computer to much. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking in homes, killing people, and high sacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you trun your computer off so that you are not temted to go back on it.
<START>

To the @CAPS1, I have recently heard that some people think that computers don't benefit society. However, I disagree with that. First, it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. Also, it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends. And lastly, it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can't go outside. Some people might not agree with me. However, I believe the computer wasn't a waste of thought. I think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world. First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and, other things. People, professors, historians, and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday. That means everyday someone can learn something everyday of their life. When I do research on a important person in history, I learned things I never learned in school. The computer is the best way to allow people to put info they've learned for other people to see and gain knowledge of each other these are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can learn on a computer. Also, the computer allows family and friends stay in touch with other family and friends in far away places. If there was computers and someof your family moved to a diffrent. There wouldn't be an efficient way to stay in touch with them. The computer allows you to send e-mail to a families computer or celluar phones. The computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away. My brother is in @LOCATION1 and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video chat with him. If there was no computer, I wouldn't be able to chat with my brother. Lastly, the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day. Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public. When I can't go outside because of the weather I get on my computer and play video games. The games keep me company. I can never play with other people with online multiplayer. Some of the games are educational also. The games teach you different things about history. 
<START>

Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike it. On the hand, I believe the computers put positive effects on people. First of all, they are a great way for kids to have fun: @CAPS1, people can learn very interesting facts. Lastly, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family. These are a few reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with on a computer you can have a lot of fun by playing games. The computer saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you bought a game system it would cost well over @MONEY1 but on a computor you can find and play games for free. Not all games have to be like "@CAPS2 of @CAPS3" or "@CAPS2 of @CAPS5" they can be games about sports. Supose one student broke his leg and he love playing soccer. He could just on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can @CAPS1 learn various facts right from their computers. The most important thing that computors are made for is to learn new things. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if every one put what they know into the computer than people can get learne any thing from them, I remember @CAPS6 my friend once told me about some guy named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me, @CAPS6 I got home I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him I knew more than my friend about @PERSON2. If he ever have a question in class and our teacher can't answer it he/she always tells us to either "@CAPS7" it or "@CAPS8" it. They both are search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers you can @CAPS1 communicate with people from different countries. What if @PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be me right now? Anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it @CAPS9 or @CAPS10, or whether its @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS11 all are a great way to communicate with people. With tele phones it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the roputer it is absolutely freen. You could be living in @LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @LOCATION5. You could live in @LOCATION2 and email someone in @LOCATION3. Communication every where is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in @LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. @CAPS6 we use the computer it is even better because they can even see our fare throught the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negitive at all for all I know is that help people around the @CAPS2. They help kids have fun with the games we can play. @CAPS1, it teaches children and adults various now things. Lastly, it is a great communication strategy. I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so every one can see how computers have a positive effect on people.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers? Computers are one of technology's greatest and are sweeping the nation, as well as the world. As you can probrably tell, I believe that computers have positive effects on people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and create the ability to learn and research quickly and efficiently. And don't forget get that they offer ways to chat online. Have you ever played a game of baseball where you just can't seem to just hit the ball? Well, sounds like you need to work on your hand eye coordinator. Studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people that use computers have an increased hand eye when doing activities like sports or games. So if you use a computer, you'll be hitting homeruns, not striking out. After you've won your baseball game, it's time for homework, and guess what? Your teacher assigned a project that's due tomorrow! Don't panic, get online! Computers help you learn and research, which is faster than going to the library and getting a book. Say you need the date olympic gold medalist @PERSON1 was born, google it! Finally, once you have your information all you have to @CAPS2 is your source. Ok, now your homework is done and you want to talk to your friend about your plans on @DATE1. Computers offer numerous ways to chat online. There's @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, woVoo, @CAPS7, and many more. So you sign into @CAPS7, and talk with your best friend. Now your not bored anymore. Computers are a great way to decrease boredom, just by talking with friends online, but you better go to bad soon because you have @ORGANIZATION1's in the morning! As you can see, computers are incorporated into our daily lives. They're everywhere! I believe that they're changing society, mostly for the better. They teach hand eye coordination, help you research and learn, and let you chat with friends. Additionally, if you don't already have a computer, then get one!
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, In my point-of-view, I think that computers are positive and can give a lot of information to us humans. Even though some people say computers are sometimes used way too much, computers help the world get in touch with relatives and family from arand the world, job findings in different countries and states, and also learning about the whole world. I'm going to explain to you why I think computers are positive for humans. To start off, I would like to say that not everyones families & friends live close by to each other. They @MONTH1 live across the whole other side of the world. This is why we have webcams and chatting on computers. How could anyone expect us to see our family in friends if there is no webcam? Okay yeah we have cell phones but not everyone can afford them. People can go to their hearest library and use the computer there for free! The next reason why I say that computers are important is because when you get tired of fired from yar job, you can't just sit home and expect live in your house for free, you have @CAPS1 find another job. You can sign up for jobs right on your computer. How much easier could it get? Now you don't have to borrow your mom's car to go to the interview. Furthermore the last reason I would like to commit is that learning about the world is very important for the young and old. You don't think that every single teacher visited somewhere else and that's how they know about the world? No of course not! Teachers also use computers to look up information on a certain subject. For me I like to learn a bout crocodiles in @LOCATION1. I live in the @ORGANIZATION2. Do you really think I would go all the way of @LOCATION1 to learn about crocodiles when I can just turn the computer on and get-lost in the crocodile world? No of course not. It would be fun though to traver to @LOCATION1 to see that but I don't have that kind of money. To sum all this up, I think you can see my part of the argument. I really consider leaving computers to what they do best, helping humans. It's one of the best inventions ever made. Wouldn't you agree?
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us regularly? Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computer allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also website such as mapquest & yellowpages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleages instantly. What one does, is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are ease for our everyday life. So, don't spent your life on the computer but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine. Stop writing on that pad, get up and type it on your computer!

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you probably have seen there is a lot of controversy over wether computers are helpful or harmful. I for one agree computers are helpful because, they help you learn about new things, talk to people around the world, and try new things. For instance have you ever wondered what the capital of @LOCATION6 is? Well with the you could find that answer in the blink of an eye, that's because the internet gives you unparraellel information that no book has. The internet seally lets you see what is happening in or world because there are various news sources, and blogs on the internet, @PERSON1 do you remember the earthquake in @LOCATION4 well I sure do, because I found it out on the internet. You can also find directions to places, sports stats and about different places. Well whats a better way to find out a bout those than talking with people who live there? I don't think anything is, seriously is it better reading about @LOCATION5 or talking to someone in @LOCATION5? Thats the beauty of the internet is it bonds the world together into a tighter realationship, I remember chatting with people from @LOCATION3 while the gold medal game @PERSON3. Sure some people would say that you could meet someone in person from a different country, well how would you meet someone from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1, because I never have. People could say go to the place to talk to the person and, with the internet, it's very possible. Have you @PERSON1 wanted to go to @PERSON4? Well with the internet all you need is your credit card and you could be there tomorrow because the internet allows you to try new things. Have you ever wanted to try pingpong, it so you could or does a set offline and have it shipped to you in a couple of days, I always wanted to go to a zoo but, I didn't know of any, so I used the internet and see school for zoos near @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 and before I could move the results for @PERSON2 zoo were right infront of me. That is why the internet is very helpful. To sum it all up the internet is very helpful to people who use it correctly, but I agree that the internet can be inappropriate. With blackson the not needed sites the internet can do almost anything.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, Advances in technology, while amazing, don't always have a positive effect on society. That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, "don't talk to strangers," when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In @DATE1's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology is advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the @LOCATION1. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in @DATE1's world.

Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a great piece of technology. Computers are great for many reasons. Three of these reasons are pleasure, convienience, and education. I believe that these three reasons are the main reason we use computers today. One reason we use computers is for pleasure. On certain websites, you can talk to friends, see what your friends are doing, you can even video chat with them. Also, you can watch movies, @CAPS4 episodes, and videos. In addition, you can listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. I strongly beleive that pleasure is one of the main reasons we use computers today. Another reason why we use computers is convienience. Most people in @LOCATION1 have a computer in their home. Computers are convienient because you pay bills on the internet. You email co-workers about jobs. In addition, computers can help people create websites so their their buisness is more noticeable. As you can see, computers are a very convienient piece of technology. The final reason why we use computers is education. On a computer, you can learn just about anything. You can learn about @CAPS5 history, sports, you can learn about current events in the world. Computers can help you study, take notes, and helps do your homework. When I have a project, I always use the computer to find important information about the topic. As you can see, education is the most important reason why we use computers. Now, I think you understand how computers are important in @LOCATION1's education, pleasure and convienience. I hope you listened to my opinion on computers and I also hope you continue to tell people how great and important computers are.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is my belief that people are spending too much time on computers. Now a days you can do anything on a computer. Such as, talk to friends, play games, even turn off your lights! But, what are they taking away from us? There taking away communication skills and is same uses creating cyber bullying. They also don't let us enjoy the beauty of nature and exercising. One out of every @NUM1 teens spends more time telling people on the computer then face to face. This way of communication prevents children from learning valuable social skills which come with conversing face to face. This makes @CAPS1 more difficult for children to make friends, or even to do well is work intencies. Studies say by each upcoming generation the communication skills are decreasing by @PERCENT2. Eventually, if @CAPS1 continues to drop at this the will have a world that went. This style of communication has ever a new type of bullying. What have we do to people? You waste over @NUM2 days a year sitting in front of your computer. in this wasted time you could be out going for a jog or walking the day. in fact, the percentage of people that have computer is much greeter than the percentage of people that do not only you exercising for yourself. The computer cant do @CAPS1 for you. Sitting in front of a computer does nothing for your body. You physicaly have to get up and move. Its good for your health, got fresh air. Coming to a point about fresh air @PERCENT1 of people who use computers at home are more likely telecom sick than people who doesnt leave you set seem for sometimes. Seeing nature like never before, I dont think. Yes you can look us the green spotted tree from on the internet, but its nothing like in nature and @CAPS1 is real life. Discoveries cannot be made about new species on the computer, a computer cant find @CAPS1 for your find @CAPS1. People are and less about the environment does to computer. They are seeing a picture not the healthy. After writing this I can te the that I was about myself and personal, which scared me the most I realizes I am becoming more and more dependent on computer each day. I dont seeing friends as. I dont go outside as much, and I don't as much. This true for must people whether you realize @CAPS1 or not I personaly ongoing today and out on time computing you will te. Computer are to much lets for from there hold and deo something more with there lives. This well improve our. So this brings to my final that computers are a bad influence on human and we should use less of them and for ourselves by doing not seeing. Thank you for your time.

Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers. I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's to @PERSON2 who is our presiden now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing. They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it. Thank you.

Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is "internet". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!

Dear Readers, I understand that some @MONTH1 think computers can effect peoples' lives. This is because it causes them to not go outside excersising and enjoying nature. My point of view is that people have the choice to go out side, exercise, and enjoy nature. Computers give so much information that it could give people ideas of fifferent activities people can do outdoors. Computers also have abilities to download videos and other soft ware that people can look at and perform excersing with them, and learn techniques. In my life my mom and dad, and many other people im my family, look online at different websites to see what activities we can do on the weekends and seasonal activities. Computers are very important and are life changing. If it wasn't for computers some people wouldn't be able to get an education. Doctors, police officers, and banks use computers for thier job and it helps us go through are everyday lives with ease. From what i see and understand i that computers have a positive effect on our lives. Computers can be negative but it all has to do with self control and how you use it.
<START>

Computers are becoming more advanced everyday, almost everyone owned, or owns a computer. I think, ther benefit society very greatly. One of the many ways is, they teach you hand eye coordination. So even @CAPS1 your playing games your hand-eye coordination @MONTH1 be improving. With hand-eye coordination you @MONTH1 need it to play sports like baseball. When do you need hand-eye coordination the most? I use it most, when I'm playing hockey or, baseball. So next time your on a computer, remember your hand-eye coordination is improving. Another reason we benefit from having computers, is we learn about far away places. @CAPS1, you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can't travel to, use a computer to gain some background knowledge @CAPS1 you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it, what do you do? I know! get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is, @CAPS1 you have to fly out to @LOCATION1 and don't know anythin about it, use a laptop on the way over there. @CAPS1 you do that, you'll have some schema about the place. As you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries. Finally, computers are great for learning a new language. You need to learn spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? Download a free language learning app. @CAPS1 you don't know a lot of french and need a few words but don't have a dictionary. Use a translator. When you are talking to someone from @LOCATION1 and you don't know there language use an english to african dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have a great translater applications that are free so, @CAPS1 you don't know a language hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, weather it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computer benefit society greatly.

To the editor of the daily newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages. Computers these days are being used way too much for useage of priveleges that we already have. While people are using the computer for random activities, they are not having any physical activity. Also emailing and facebooks are great websites to communicate with but people are checking emails all the time instead paying attention to when their parents get home from a long day at work. With this people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side tracked and forget to do homeworks. Computers are great invention but with todays society there are to many issues that aren't always being appointed. In the first place, people aren't getting the exercise that they need because they are playing on the computer or video chatting with a friend. About @NUM1 of america is obess so excercising should definitely be a priority but with these new websites and activities on the computer people are getting held back. With this, kids and adults are communicating in high end ways that waste too much time. The computers have so many stupid activities that are not needed which make us not excercise because many people think that the options and webpages are important and needed. Indeed computers are a technology that is needed but people are taking advantage of it too much by having their whole life in the computer instead of having it toward other things such as excercising and being healthy. In addition to computers taking away from excerscising they are also taking time away from your family. For example, @TIME1 when my dad got home. From a long day at work no @CAPS1 truly a bear hug that he was longing for because everyone was so interested in their email or what my sisters friend just said on facebook. Family is the most important part of your life and if computers are getting in the way, computer use absolutely has to be changed. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still talk to your family and give them hugs but when you rae talking to your sister through facebook eventhough there just in the next room. It is lobvious needs to be done. Computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than @CAPS1. Finally, computers take away family but also schoolwork and works. Most kids spend so much time on the computer and they to do their homework. This is unexeptable and can be away, kids and teenagers are always playing games, facebooking friends and video chatting making them realize at that they need to start their home work! A girl from @PERSON1 said, "@CAPS1 time I was on facebook for the whole afternoon and then I realized I never started my @CAPS2 essay!" This has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain. Moreover, yesterday I remember that I was video chatting my friend for @NUM2 hours and didn't start my homework until @NUM3! The computer evryone that goes it which is uneceptable. Without computers a negative affect people. off people exercising out with time in the computer which is unbelievable and terrible. Also they cut communication with your family making it rare to truly bond with them. With this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework. Overall computers are that make life that much more stressful. Thank you for listening.

In myopinion computers are a good sorce @CAPS2 imformation, camuni-cation and business computers make things easier. @CAPS2 example, instead of going to the libarary to get information on something, you can you use a computer. Computers are one of the most advance technology, you can search anything in the world. computers are also a huge help on a project @CAPS2 school or @CAPS2 work some peoples jobs, they are required to use computers. Computers are even good @CAPS2 learning about things you've never even heard of. Some people even take classes online. Computers could also be helpful to plan a vacation. computers are often used to comunicate with others, family, and friends. if you own a computer, you mostly likely have an e-mail, homepage, or @CAPS1 to keep in touch with people. There are even sites to meet newpeople. In my opinion, I think computers have a positive effect on people computers can be used @CAPS2 many things, they are a good sorce of technology. Computers could take much time off your hands, @CAPS2 example, you have a @NUM1 page essay due tomorrow, I'm sure it'd be way easier and faster to type it out than to write it and mess up, @CAPS3 typing a letter or paper, computers have "@CAPS4 @CAPS5" so if you mess up on a word, it will shaw you where you made your mistake to save more time.

Dear newspaper I think that there are many reason why computers are good for people. Compters are good for people because they help keep friends conected. Reason two is that they can be great knowledg   for people. @CAPS1 third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with teamworks and team building skills. Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect. First of all, I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a colledge far away, or move because of a job you will most likely, if @CAPS5 is further away, loose connection with you friends. But, using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like @CAPS3, twitter and myspace you can simpily look up your distant friends from  you previoulsy lived and have contact with them. Youi can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, end maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer. Experts also say that @CAPS5 is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a scoial networking site has reconnected me with a @CAPS2. When i was younger I had a @CAPS2 whos grandmother lived  to @CAPS1 dad. After a little over a year of  him being good friends be moves to @LOCATION1, I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year I also moved to a different town, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 searched me on @CAPS3 and we got connected again, I have found out he moved back to where I use to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are @CAPS4 good for people. The second reason, @CAPS5 is that computers can be great knowledge scources for people. If you ever need to set information   that not have to  through the  of book,then, a computer is the thing for you. As long as you than  to find an accurate and reliable scourse than a computer. Is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on @CAPS5. Statistics show that you can find @PERCENT2 more information on a computer than a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolite and computer will rain  as knowledge scources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills. What I  by programs is yes of course videogames. Almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features. Withins the multiplayer universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. In the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is @CAPS1 third reason why I think computers are good for people. In conclusion, I think that computers are good for people, they help to reconnect friends, , knowledge, and build teambuilding skills with programs that are out for @CAPS5.

In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more that @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. "@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution," says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. "The more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl. She woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @NUM5 out @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make.

Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things, you can also find a relitive you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends, another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's and other devices. My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us alot of things. If you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things on on the computer you can look it up and find out. Another is you can find a family member you haven't seen in along time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer. Also alot of people @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again they cannot find them and fill close to them again. And they can find you if they relly need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friends releaves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and alot of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers their's no point of music. In conclusion I think computers have a good effect on people.
<START>

To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 concern, today people of all ages are useing computers. Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you @MONTH1 have needed to know. Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper. Teacher have troble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful. The near by libarry will always have extra computers students can use to write a papper. If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you @MONTH1 find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives. Some of these relatives @MONTH1 live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that home work. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information. Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there. By going on one of the search engines they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo. In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 & how it is in a @CAPS9. Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope you will look into what I said.

Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes technology, especially computers can bring people together and computers are very benificial to @CAPS5. Also computers can save you time and money now. First off computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! and I don't get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop. and if I didn't have that opportunity then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together. It is wonderful experience. As I said before computers can be benifical to @CAPS5. You might be thinking "@CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes. com, if that was have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very benifical! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered offline. You can get things from food to cloths and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, @CAPS5 with homeworks, family and friends and adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, "@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me." @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in "amazing nature parks" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, "I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday." I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. "The best way to get members," @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated," is to create a website online." @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. "@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?" I asked. "@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?

Dear @CAPS1, I am aware of the current debate about technology, however more spacificly computers. Computers are a helpful interesting & even fun peace of technology. Computers open the world to new people & places & limmiting that is uncalled for. Computers are keys to inavation & creation. When @ORGANIZATION1 did a study on the use of computers @PERCENT1 of people said they got their news files & even planned threw the computer & now @PERCENT2 of creations are being done through the computer. This illustrates the power of computers allowing people to do things that were once impossible. Now humans are capable of spreading info around the world in seconds. Computers also business grow through advertisment or work softwares. Computers are the key to help open the world to new possabilities & options not possible @NUM1 years ago. I understand my oposition is not only against computers but wants to limit there use. That is unfair & possibly unconstitutional. They argue that people exercise less due to computers, however @PERCENT3 of people, when asked has computers negativly impacted your exercise said "no" & one man stated "because of computers I learned new workouts & even found a great local trainer." @CAPS2 you can understand computers are not just about games & toys, but allowing people to grow & learn more to help them find plasas to travel & assist in their exercise. Computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication. Emails, @CAPS3 and other softwares allow people to communicate accross the world. @CAPS2 the world begins to inovate itself communication is key. People are capable of spreading news in seconds, infact @PERCENT4 of news is now done through the computer. New @CAPS4 times & the wall street @CAPS5 have moved their news mainly to the internet allowing people across the to see them. Work is also primairly done through the computer now. People are able to send files, ship & even order online. Even important business meeting are done throught the computer, where all the people can be at their house. Computers are neccesity when it comes to communications work & news. I hope you understand & put to use my opoinon. Computers are needed to grow @CAPS2 a world solving problems comunicating & expanding that is why I belive there is no problems with computers.

Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1 I am writing this letter to inform you that I think computers are a smart investment for a couple of reasons. The following are some reasons on why computers benifit society, they allow children to do homework with some help, children can talk to other friend and when children are board they can play games music on it. UGH! I don't get this sometimes I am sitting at the kitchen table tring to do my history homework but I don't know the year the revalotionary war was. @CAPS2 I go in my room turn the computer on and @CAPS6 there I go to google and look up what I need to know. This also benefits parents too because if they are doing the bills or something they don't have to be bothere, the kid could look it up and know it is @CAPS6! Finally all my homework is done but my computer is still on I'm going to see who is online that I can talk to and make sure I didn't miss any homework. Talking to your friends online could help you stay in contact with friends in other states or just people you don't see very often. This can help make new friends or make friendships closer and cause less problems. Alright no body is home or online @CAPS2 I think @CAPS3 going to kick back turn some music to kick back turn some music on and maybe take a nap. Or I can play the new counter strke game I got ! YEAH on playing counter strike. Least death on my team that game! Alright thats enough of counter strike for the day I think I'm going to turn same music on and lay in bed. Now that I have told you all of the benefits of computers You @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6! keep in mind that it can help with homework, talking with friends, or just having some fun.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your motabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone. Even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights. Many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a survey an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and about an hour with family. The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind, ask your self how useful the computer really is. Sure it's good at researching things quickly but its also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glassses and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all.

How do you think the world would be without computers? I think it would bring us back a couple of ages. We need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn. Without computers our country would be nothing. People say you don't get enough exercise and don't enjoy nature enough. Well there are ways to do that too. Communication is one of the greatest things about computers. Teenagers love to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 eachother when there at home because its so fast its like really talkiing to them. @CAPS1-@CAPS2 is another thing people love to use. Bosses of companies use @CAPS1-@CAPS2 to send @CAPS10 to everyone so they're all on the same page. There is also a new video chat were you can talk face to face with someone and see them from the other side of the world if you wanted to. You can also learn all you need to know on computers. They have dictionary sites, history sites, encyclopedia sites, etc. You can find any certain time in history and have a whole site on it. Or a site called wikipedia you can look up a certain thing and get a whole web page dedicated to the info of that object or person. Schools also use sites to help students have their knowledge. They have math sites, english sites, @CAPS3 studies sites, and (a science teacher favorite) @CAPS4 @CAPS5 for everything you need to know about science. They also have lots of websites for help with a new language. There is a recent program out caled @CAPS6 @CAPS7 that is on the computer but teaches you any language as well as any human teacher. Some people still say its not enough. They say you still need exercise, nature, and time with your family. You can still do all that on computers. You can look up certain workouts that you might want to do. You can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live. They have websites (like @CAPS8) were you can @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @CAPS11 pictures, play games, and video chat with your family members who @MONTH1 be living across the world from you. But you canstill do it. Even though I explained a lot of reasons why computers are a great thing to have, there are still a ton more. The teach hand eye coordination and many other things too. You can check sports scores from the night before or check sports score from @NUM1 years ago. You can do all this on the computer and more. This is why computers have a positive effect on people and everyone should have a computer.
<START>

Dear, newspaper writer I think the computer has a posative effect of people because @CAPS1 helps people around the world learn to speak a different language, @CAPS1 helps people talk to their friends around the world and @CAPS1 helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to write a letter and send @CAPS1 out to people they work for or to their bosses that need the report in by the end of the day. Those are the three reason that computers have a posative effect. @CAPS1 helps people learn to speak a different language without spending a lot of money like using rosetta stone you have to spend @NUM1 us dollars but online you dont have to spend a dime. the best part is that @CAPS1 is free. The slogan for rosetta stone is "I have spent less money than months of formal classes." I think their new slogan should be is " we have a better learning company than anyone else." That is why @CAPS1 helps people learn a different language. @CAPS1 also helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to talk to their friends you can aim, web cast, and ever text to make @CAPS1 easier @CAPS1 talk to friends on the internet. The reason they created that is so people dont have to travel to far away places and spend money to tell a friend important news that is only one thing. So in conclusion you dont have to spend a lot of money to tell a friend something. The third reason that the computer helps people is that people san e mail theor boss that they are faxing their final repoet to the big interview for a new position in the place where they work, @CAPS1 helps your boss by making @CAPS1 easier to read and @CAPS1 better because you could be in japan and your boss could be in florida @CAPS1 will take like @NUM2 minutes to get to your bosses computer. That is why @CAPS1 is easier to send messages to your boss. The three main reasons are that you can learn a different language without paying a dime that you can talk to your friends easier and that you can send messages to your boss easier that calling him or her. Those are the three reasons that computers are posative.

To middlebury paper, @CAPS1 the article on wether or not computers benefit society, my opinion is that they have lots @MONEY1 pros to make them a worthwhile thing to have in our towns schools, homes and businesses. They can help more than they hurt, and can you honestly see your life without checking e-mails and keeping up to date with our society? Computers in schools help to increase the amount @MONEY1 learning our children. @CAPS1 example, @PERSON1 can study their math facts online @CAPS1 math or learn about the skeletal system @CAPS1 health classes. It also is an advantage is conserving money because instead @MONEY1 having to pay @CAPS1 your son or daughter to fly to @LOCATION1 to learn about the collisreum, you can let them learn about it on the internet first, to see if the trip is actually worthwhile. Also an essential thing needed to life is hand eye coordination, and a way to practice that is playing exercise practice games on a computer. Thats help install the coordination your towns children will use @CAPS1 the rest @MONEY1 their ! Educational benefits will only increase as technology, so cutting children from it now is a big mistake! With computers, communication is a . Students can get homework through their e-mail. Saving time so they have more time coming up. The cost effectiveness computers because instead @MONEY1 paying @CAPS1 phone bills and tutors @CAPS1 your children and cellphone bills, you can just talk through e-mail and potentially save @MONEY1! Keeping in touch with families is simplified also because in just one e-mail you can catch with all your family members! Speeding up communication with computers clearly has benefits no one wants to miss out on. So why would you make that mistake. @CAPS1 addressing you can't place the blame on computers @CAPS1 why people don't exercise people as much. People choose how community they exercise, on the computers. Computers don't control wether you family or not. If anything they help together! Spending time in nature is that particular persons. Choice no one elses. All these cons can't be blamed on computers, because its the people that decide how much they're used, not the computer. All in all, I think keeping our use @MONEY1 computers where it is now is the best idea, because without it communication and education will decrease and with that, who says exercising will increase?! Overall the choice is the computers user, not the computer, so when used in discretion, computos contribute greatly to society.

Dear @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS1 has come to @CAPS2 attention that certain members of our society believe that computers are not beneficial. This position comes from lack judgement and a closed mind. Computers are lifelines to buisness workers who use them to complete all of their work, these tools also enable news of disaster or weather to spread efficiently and effectively. These technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends. In todays society computers are vital and getting rid of them would be like stopping oxygen from making its way to the body, being accompanied by multiple severe consequences. First and foremost, about @PERCENT1 of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers. These works of art aren't just handy-dandy toys , rather @CAPS5 essential to the working class @CAPS5 a # @NUM1 pencil to a student taking a cut. @PERSON3, an owner of a small buisness, agrees. "@CAPS2 company designs software and uses computers @NUM2. Many of @CAPS2 employees work from home and have to own computers." The growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon, rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others. By ripping our computers from lives of workers chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences. Adults aren't the only ones whose jobs consists of computers. Nowadays students' homework is mostly online, computers decrease the amout of time needed to write an essay and are glare to students of all ages, @PERSON4, an eighth grades at @ORGANIZATION1, is an example of this dilema. Every night she has at least three hours of homework and usually one hour be @CAPS1 requires a computer, however, this isn't a problem because @CAPS1 cuts back the time @CAPS1 takes for @PERSON4 to do her homework. She can quickly type up an @CAPS3 essay or research a science topic instead of doing @CAPS1 painstakingly slow using an old fashion method. Moreover, computers are doors into the real world, especially for residents of @LOCATION1. Whether some people like to believe @CAPS1 or not, @LOCATION1 is a bit of a sicludded area where people aren't aware of what is going on outside of their closed off town. Computers cause news to spread like electricity and open @LOCATION1 residents eyes to national and global problems @PERSON2, another student at @ORGANIZATION5, states, " @CAPS4 the earthquake took place in @LOCATION3 @CAPS2 friends and I were all at lunch, @CAPS5 we came back to class @CAPS2 teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the white board" @CAPS6 computers were taken away a stream of knowledge would be cut off from adults and children. Most importantly, computers create communication between friends and family calling up to talk to someone isn't always an option, so computers are the better choice. Families can connect with each other no matter @CAPS6 they have cell phone reception or what area of the world they are in, @PERSON1 is a senior at @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION1 who agrees. "@CAPS4 I go to college next year I am going all the way to @LOCATION2 and want to be able to talk to @CAPS2 family, via email and instant message I can contact them even @CAPS6 its inconvenient because they don't have to respond right away." @PERSON1 brings up a good point computers serve the luxury of communication, which is vital to keep @PERCENT2 of healthy relationships, @CAPS5 shows a study at @ORGANIZATION4. In conclusion, computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away. The are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world. Computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate. Therefore, I urge you, readers of the @ORGANIZATION2, to raise your voice about the benefits of computers, so they aren't taken away from our society.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1? Are you there?" "@CAPS2 you hear me?" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necesity to an average person. Computers help everyone, and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but @CAPS2 they always prove trustworthy? Computers are alwasy reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others...that are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you @CAPS2 choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personaly preffered option is @ORGANIZATION2 email. I myself have family in @LOCATION1, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be through the roof! How else am I supposed to keep intact with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families in @LOCATION2 say they have relatives that are far away. That is @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their famly. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you @CAPS2 interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student of @PERSON1, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far away colleges or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could visit a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are killed for them. Computers are the easy, environment friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that @MONTH1 be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible @CAPS3. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. "@CAPS3 are only powerful if you let them be, and let them take control," says @CAPS4, an expert on the subject. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today, and tomorrow, know what is out there, and how to stop the minor @CAPS3. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn now things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. What are safe even if some don't agree. It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes computers! I see why you might think no, they should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and t.v. will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers, and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to!"

More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society, are right. I feel this way because people need to start exercising it more, and interact with family and friends. Also, should enjoy life. Please read on to read in detail, as to why I feel this way. Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more, they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. Also, some of them don't even exercise at all. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much. Those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer. When you fight with people you want to gey away from it so you go back to the computer. It's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time. Lastly, they should enjoy life. See the world through their own eyes. Party with friends and family. Go to college and do something with their lives. They need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers, ipods, or even cellphones. In conclusion, the reasons I feel this why are because people need to exercise more, and interact with family and friends. Also, they need to enjoy life. I hope you understand as to why I feel this way.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are benefitual to society. This because computers do tasks such as helps research, communicating with others, and has fun games and websites. Computers are really great sources for whatever you trying to do. Honestly, a @CAPS2 without computers I wouldn't know what to do. Computers are like digital encyclopedias, which has just about all the information your looking for. Computers have databases or websites design to have with research just as the do. Say that you have a essay due tommorrow and you need quick and valid information you can simple go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which is a computer database. Your end up with saild facts to help with your final draft. So, you wouldn't have to go that far to research. Communicating is something else the computer helps with. For example email and @ORGANIZATION1 is a way to communicate. Email is where you can send a message and a wait a reply while on the other hand @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is where you get @ORGANIZATION1 replys. The latest thing in the communicating @CAPS2 is video chating. This where the person your chatting with can hear and see exactly what your doing. This is useful for families who life a good distance from each other. Computers play many roles and being used for fun is one. the @CAPS5 has many fun gaming websites such as @CAPS6.com miniclips.com, and @LOCATION1. This websites help take your mind off a bad day. You can also buy computer games for your computer. A very popular game is The @CAPS7. This game is base around your charater and the life you chose for it to live this game can take you to mother place where all your stress just fade away. So, computers betters society in many different ways. A few include research, communication, and to have fun. The computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich ones life. Computers take on difficult tasks and usually succed. So, computers are truely one thing we need.

Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you know long of time spent on technology could result in cancer? ever since they were invented, computers have been advanced more and more even years. People, especially children, forget the risks of physical health. Family and friends and even mental health. Obesity rate is over to @LOCATION1, the highest it has ever People wouldn't even know technology is to blame. @CAPS2 you know the average @CAPS3 teenager spends at least @NUM1 hours on the computers? Think off all the calories that build up without exercise. If people could limit their at risk for diabetes. Diabetis is one of the most common disease involved with technology besides obesity. @NUM2 @CAPS4 are diabetic which means we are not at a safe health rate. If you limit computer use to @NUM3 hour a day, and work out atleast @NUM4 minutes a day, think of how healthy you will be you will have more healthy you will be you will have more energy, and mental focus, sleep wont be an issue, and you will be more physically attractive. Computers also lead friendship torn apart. cyber bullying is also a problem. @NUM4 of students are cyber bullies. This means that friendship will wont see each other if they spend all day on the mental health when they turn on the computer. @CAPS2 you know some forms of cancer are caused by the radiation of technological devices? Radiation eats away the brain causing altsimers, and other mental disease that snew at old age. Young adults in school also got used to texting. @PERCENT1 of students text and @PERCENT2 get used to terrible spelling, thats @PERCENT3 who accidentally write "thru, lazy, or even native @CAPS5 during school." This is the mental if of technology taking over. So as you can tell computers affect health, socializing, and even mentality. So don't be part of the problem, please, stop overuse of technology.

Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game "@CAPS3 of @CAPS4." This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, "Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting." The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more.

Dear newspaper I hear the more and more people use computers and I think thats so awesome because people talk online with other people. @CAPS5 they teach you how to use a computer. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Computers it the more advanced technology so its @CAPS1 the people is using it. I love to be in the computer all day because I always enter to @CAPS2 and talk online. @CAPS4 example some people like to talk with a family member the is not in the @LOCATION1 so they communicate from the computer. Sometimes I talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2 because I have @NUM1 years I dont see her. So I think talk online or using the computer is important. @CAPS4 example even grandma have @CAPS3 and she talks online with her family members. I think the using the computer is not a bad benefit because it helps you be in communication with your family or friends. That is why I think the people is wrong saying the or is not. Secondly, it teach you hand-eye coordination my grandma is old but computer and @CAPS4 example my grandma a nice hand eye coordination because when she goes to the letters she just ress and all she is correct. think computers have a effect on people. It @CAPS5 helps people write better and better. @CAPS4 example I love and when it write I dont need to go to other I write king of @CAPS5 the helps me with my eye and hand @CAPS6 is the it helps you find faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example on @ORGANIZATION1 you find what ever street you want. It @CAPS5 help you find in the computer about people. @CAPS4 example if I have a project I find the information on @ORGANIZATION1 about people or places. The computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people. I think is a positive effect on people. Finally, I think the computers are great benefits society. One reason is the you could talk online with people. @CAPS5 it teach you hand-eye and the helps your brain and sight. It @CAPS5 helps you at your hand movements. @CAPS6 reason is the give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example I have a project in @CAPS7 and I have to learn and search about forensic doctor and I search everything on the computer. I think the computers help your brain think more and computers are advanced technology. So I think their benefits our society.
<START>

I agree that computers have a bad effect on people because they will spend less time exercising. To much time on the computer takes away knowledge and takes away time with family and friends. So, please listen up so I @MONTH1 explain why I feel this way. My first reason to this situation is people will spend less time exercising which can lead to drowsiness or laziness if you stop exercising. Another reason is that it can affect your ability to run or even stand up because @PERSON1 says that, "people who exercise a lot will be able to do work but if you don't you won't be able to do nothing." @CAPS1 of all you'll miss out on the fun while you are to be to lazy to come. My second reason to this situation is that it takes away knowledge. For one you might forget what you learned. Seconds toturing @MONTH1 be needed because you couldn't focus. @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 even forget the people you know even where you live if you spend to much time on the computer. @CAPS1 reason to this situation is that it takes time away from your family and friends.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student I believe that computers have many bad effects on people. Most people think that computers are just new helpful technology, but there is more to it than just that. There are many things going on in the cyber world. Computers are quite helpful in school research, work and other important stuff, but there are many bad effects too. Kids these days are so attached to their computers almost all day after getting home from school which means that they barely do homework, projects, and important assignments from getting too distracted by the computer. There are some parents who get tricked by their kids that they are just doing homework, but reality is that kids these times are meeting tons of strangers through social networks such @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 @NUM1, @CAPS6 and other networks. Once that they decide to meet in person with these strangers many things go wrong because not everyone is @CAPS2 nice @CAPS2 they @MONTH1 seem through the internet. It shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much. people such @CAPS2 young children, pre teens and teenagers are able to view many harmful and inappropriate things anyone their ages shouldn't be viewing at all. Another concern is how people spend all day on their computers probably eating any type of junk food and then they don't exercise at all and they gain weight and not well fit physically which becomes a health issue for kids @CAPS2 age @NUM2 to much older people such @CAPS2 age @NUM3 and much older too which turns out to be a bad health life for people. From people spending nearly all day on the computer, they aren't able to go out and discover new things, exercise, hang out with friends or just have fun and spend time with their families. I also do strongly consider that the computers or laptops should not stay in a kids room because then they lock themselves in their room all day and they even stay up till really late even past midnight and then it becomes a real issue for kids or adults to get up early in the @TIME1 for school or work and are usually late. This pretty much shows how computers are not so great for people all the time. In order for people to be able to use their computers and have a life they can plan out a schedule of how long to use the computer and it might help them out a lot.
<START>

I believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family. If you are on the computer and one of your friends ask you to go outside you are most likely to say no because the computer is grabing your attention more than going outside. That hurts your health and your relationship with your friend. If your family is going to a movie to have family time maybe you will stay because you would stay home on the computer. That effects the relationship with your family. Most people rather stay on the computer than spend time working out. So that effects your health because most of the time your on the computer for a long time your going to end up hungry and keep eating and eating and since your not working out you get fat. Now your not working out and you just keep eating. So since you are not working out and your mind is always on the computer you can get sick. Thats why most people are not healthy because of computers. Computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes your friend can ask you to go outside or to work out and you say no because your on the computer that messes up your relationship with your friend. Or your family can be having a movie night and your on the computer while they leave. That is messing up the relationship with your family. Being on the computer you can go nights without sleeping. I your playing a realy good game on the computer and it comes time for you to take a rest and since the game is so fun you don't sleep. Then after a while you get addicted and won't stop playing. So you won't get sleep and if you have school you won't be able to concentrate you will to busy worried about the game. So thats why computer aren't so good. It can mess up your health. I can mess up your social life with family and friends. You won't get a lot of sleep and won't be able to concentrate.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1! Get off that computer it is @TIME1. But mom I don’t want to im in the middle of a game. Does that conbersation sound familiar? Of course it does. Every kid likes to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer @NUM1 is not a good thing. In this matter experts are definatley @PERCENT1 right because kids and adults are spending too much time on the computer. These people can do other things like excersising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up. Every years my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dash, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to @DATE2 then my dad does another assment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excersises are bench pressing, squating, and dumbell curles. There are more challenging excersise but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that trainign and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrls to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excersise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their families insted of being on the computer @NUM1.

One girl sits by her computer doing homework. Another girl with her computer, talks to her friends. Those girls are doing activitys that make our world more productive. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help people with hand-eye cordination, learn about faraway places, and talk with others online. This is what computers can do to help our socity become better. Firstly, the computer can teach us hand-eye cordination. By playing games , we can use what we learn in real life. A boy can play football on line, then take what he learned and use that in a real football game. Hand-eye cordination on the computer can help us to learn new things about our society. We could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to make the community, as a whole, . These skills can also help us do more things at once. Multitasking is a difficult task to and with hand-eye cordination and computers it becomes easier. A second productive task can help us with is learning . Some people dont know going on in The computer can direct us to news The computer is literally like one huge look of use . Another positive effect that computers have on people is communication. Many people have a twitter, facebook , myspce, etc. and all those websites can help . Products like skpe, video chat , aim and email allow people to have a conversation online. Email is something that there are so many new ides. You cannot only talk you can do business, send pictures, invitations, and announcements. Schools, offices, and companys all over the world use these products and it doesn't only make society better it makes the world better. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people around the world. They can help with hand eye cordination, help you learn about far away places, and they help people communicate. That one girl doing her homeowrk get an A and the girl talking on her signs off to be with her family.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe computers and excelling technology benefits society because it can help with hand eye coordination, it will be an easy way to learn about faraway places and cultures, and your able to save and use your time more wisely. First of all every person needs hand-eye coordination, if you didn't you would either thore a ball in the comlplete other direction or you'll get hit in the face with it. Computers benefit childrens education too, they can help you discover and learn about far away places. For example if a student is studying @PERSON3 @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class or maybe @PERSON2 in music class, instead of pulling out the old, dustty biography book it would be easier to look them up on a search engine. Lastly the computer benefits everyday working or stay at home parents because if you have to get in contact with a cetain person or business quickly you don't have to take the chance of having to go look in the phone book and the person or business isn't in it, just go to to @NUM1.com type in a last name or business name, so your all set. Also if your child is being a nuisance screaming and running around the house you can just set them up with an educational game so you can get your house-hold chores finished. Those are three of the most important reasons why I think computers benefit society. They are hand-eye coordination, learning techniques and saving everyday people time.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think Computers have a bad effect on people for three reasons. One they can really hurt your eyes, two it is not safe if you have little kids in your house. Finaully three you will never see your family or friends if your on the computer. The first reason was computers have a bad effect on people is it can really hurt your eyes. If your always stareing at a computer screen all the time you can go blind. And with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes. The second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home. Like you can be watching adult movie that little kids are'nt aged enough to see if can have a bad effect And it has a bad effect on people because you will have no and if you have a little kid in your house he will always be in and he will probaly hear something really, really kid like music, @CAPS3 if you have a kid house The reason was computers have bad effects on people is that if your always on a computer you will never see your family and @CAPS3 if you are always on the computers you will miss out on the And will never you never see and don't @CAPS3 a rent on on the computers. @CAPS3 what you look And keep the little kid with you in the house. And last get off the computer and go see your family and friends.

In todays day in age, computers are a key part to business, education, and recreation and they benefit our society. First of all, you can get a better education learning from them, also, it is a great way to communicate with people. Finally, it even teacher hand-eye coordination that you could use in your everyday life. My first point is that you can get a better education using them. For example, the textbooks that we use in social studies at our school still refers to @LOCATION3 as the @LOCATION1. Computers are a great way to get up-to-date information about the world. "With our outdated textbooks in school, the @CAPS1 is our number one recourse to get information." @CAPS2 @PERSON2 eighth grade teacher. With computers, you can learn about far away places without learing the comfort of your own home. In addition to getting a great education from them, computers are an eyelent form of communication. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade and my father was across the world on a business trip. Our phones couldn't call long distance so we relied on computers to communicate with each other. This helped me get over my father's absence. When you use a computer to communicate you are also saving money." You can save over @MONEY1 a year. When you use the @CAPS1 to communicate over a cell phone." @CAPS2 @PERSON1, electronics expert. Finally, the use of a computer increas hand-eye coordination. With all the typing you do on a key board, your hand dexterity increases by the second. In fact, "@PERCENT1 of computer users are more coordinated throught their day, opposed to people who don't own a computer." @CAPS3 a recent pole in the @LOCATION2 times. And in this day in age hand-eye coordiantion is a neccesity. Besides wouldn't you like to have the ability to have your hands work without having to look at them? So as you can see, computers would benifit society and everyone who uses them. They are a great benifit that @CAPS4's need for their education and buisness. Thank you for listenging.

Dear @CAPS1, People like computers, @CAPS2 a known fact. They are very much like a dry, addicting and irrestable. Despite what people believe though computers are very good for our daily lives. You can communicate play @ORGANIZATION1, listen to music watch movies, even learn a language on the computers. So in all ways, the computer is anything but bad. @ORGANIZATION1 are fun. They help us relax. In todays age, @ORGANIZATION1 just don't give people the joy they experienced when younger. Computer @ORGANIZATION1, they are the replacement. Imagine playing baseball with a friend who lives miles away from you, while still being a kid in @LOCATION1, or set in your exercise adventure. Computer @ORGANIZATION1 broke the border giving you a higher level or "You got mail". Many people hear that sentence more than once everyday. By many, I mean millions. @CAPS2 a alert saying that someone sent you a email. @CAPS4 are messages. Sent over the @CAPS7, faster than any service. Instead of waiting @NUM1 days for a letter, In a matter of minutes you can have a message sent to your friends. Microsoft @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and other electronic messaging systems are a superior form of communication, these let us speak to the world! Although it sounds silly, @CAPS5 you wanted by you could send a message to anyone with a message box. Lets say you went to watch a certain movie, but you don't own it. With a computer with a dose drive, you can watch any @CAPS6. Better yet, you can download the movies media are available @CAPS7, with you able to watch them with the click of the mouse. Computers are filled to the top with gadgets & accesories that make our life easier. @ORGANIZATION1, movies, @CAPS4 anything you is not likely on a computer. They are the perfect tolls in modern society.

Dear @CAPS1: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. I for me I belive computers help society. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, give people, and even allows computer to chat online with other people. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer, you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I like it. Another thing I like are sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball you need to have hand-eye cordination, this will help you swing at the ball more accuratly. When a pitcher throws the ball you have to had the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing if kids used computers and become good at hand-eye cordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join travel team. Do you like to travel? I do, and are why I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before, so when I looked it up I found out that they had many torist attractions and "packages" that let you swim with dolphins, I was very excited to go and when I did, I had a biast, and to think if I didn't look it up I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! No wonder so many people like computers! One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online one main attraction online is @CAPS2, everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. One night I was chatting with a friend we were laughing having a great time, and then she reminded me that we had science homework due the very next day! I thanked her and then completed my work. You see if kids chat online their friends can remind them of important nescesitys such of homework. This could impove grades by @PERCENT1! So you now see why society needs computers and if you have forgotten let me remind you: computers teach you hand-eye cordiantion, let's you learn about faraway places and people, and now allows you to chat online. Just think what would society be like with no computers.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever used a computer? More than @PERCENT1 of the population Computers benefit society and have gotten people all over the world smarter and advanced. Computers help people learn things keep in touch with family and friends! They @MONTH1 also tad addicting but people know when to stop. Computers have brought us a long way! Computers are a magnificent tool for new things. The great websites for example search engines, dictionary even @CAPS1 all virtually encourage us to learn about the "riches" the tropical @LOCATION1. By computers letting people easily access tools that help us gain knowledge can become more advanced in many of our lives. For example by on the computer, scientist can develop new theories did uncover things! Computers also have websites and programs that can help you cannot will family and friends! "I have last touch with many of my friends from high school," @PERSON1 explains "the computer through email and facebook, is a great way to stay in touch with them!" Computers of websites including facebook, and myspace that can help people stay in touch/find family and friends. It has came to my realization to find that many people would live long, lives if they could not internet will friend. But with the help people are lively and happy including with friend! Although computer are good for this they @MONTH1 be addiction. I have people that @MONTH1 be able to have computer addiction. But on the other feel that the if he can make their decisions in what is right. If people want to spend countless hours sitting in front of the glowing technology then be it. Not one person. Computers anyone it is simply unconstituional. Most people including understand that computers are a benefitful and fantistic source of technology. @NUM1 out of @NUM1,000 people in the world are addicted to computers. There from the small we are able that computers are for from addicting. In conclusion, Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach help stay in touch and are not addicting. Therefore they very beneficial to the world, its people and technology.

If you ask me, computers are going to soon be a big problem in our lifestyles. Computers are just another material thing everyone has and seems to be benifiting from, but they aren'@CAPS1. This technology is taking away peoples freedom and will and they don'@CAPS1 even notice it. It is pretty clear to me things need to change. To begin, the computer is yet another distraction to our daily lives. I think that it is safe to admit that we don'@CAPS1 need this. Distractions like these keep us from doing the things we need to do, such as excersise. Every wants to get their extra weight off, but they can'@CAPS1 because the want to check website or talk to their friends. So its pretty much a lazy distraction. Would you really want to give up your health beacause of something so materialistic? If we keep clicking, more then @PERCENT1 of the population that are fit and healthy will become obease. I think we need to reform this problem soon. Like not promoting websites on so many @CAPS1.V networks, or have a computer shutdown week, anything that will get people to be outside enjoying life as they should. To continue, have you ever found yourself asking your kids on how to work the computer? Dont you see how sad that is? Our future leaders are already glued to the games, email and instant messaging of the net. Its plain to see they are already spending too much of their time online. This is concerning fact because more and more kids each year turn in less and less in school work because they  have better things to do such as chat with their friends or watch funny video online. Its a scary though because these children are our future leaders. This is a critical point in their lifes. They need to learn about things now so their futures arent hanging by a thread. Instead of making a habit of going online everyday why not make a habit like try to get all your homework done each night? Things in childrens lifes need to change before they pay for it later in life. To sum it up, many things about our lifestyles need to change. Wether it be in schoool work or losing weight. So I think it would be best if we took out, or lessend our computer usage to lower the distraction and more on in life without revolving our world aroud a click.

Proven by @PERSON2 the best @CAPS1 major over @PERCENT1 of children either have desktops, laptops, or some type of internet access. What so you think about this? Well I the computers are takeing up people time (like children) and not letting them get their work done. Also, computer are not only letting people talk to their friend, but its causing @CAPS5 bullying. Finally, @CAPS1 are also just maken parents more stressed out because the have to pay another bill for internet. Children now and days come home change and log right into the computer and start talking to friends and lisening to music all this sounds good intell their report cards come back and they see they are failing half there classes. I remember when my friend @CAPS3 would go home change eat and log right inside the computer. As days went around the end or the year was she noticed she had two problems. She was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes. She noticed that getting on the computer was not neccesary so for the next mouth and a half she cut down on her time on the @CAPS1 did her homework and started this pushed me to beleave that children have @CAPS1. Proven by @PERSON3 the syber bully that over @PERCENT2 of children have bin syber bullyed or @CAPS5 bulllied someone. All this happen when children are not being watched or get bored and to pick on someone. What should we do people ask @PERSON1 and she says well take away the @CAPS1. I remember when I read about the year old girl on new channels.com and it was about @CAPS5 bullied but never. This shows that children all over the world can be getting syber bullied of any moment.

Dear local newspaper, Computers are a waste of time! People that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse. Some people say they are good for research and talking to people. Both of these things you can do without a computer. Computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper then using the computer. In this economy why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same thing also on a computer you don't really talk to the person you are really just typing word to them. This can be very dangerous. Who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think. Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercize. If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obecety is already rising with the number of fast food places and computers are making it worce. And the worst part is parents don't care some children go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day and there parents don't encorige them to go outside. Children need encorigment to get moviing or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this or before you no it @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obeise. Another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this @MONTH1 be true there are other way you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also not everything on the internet is true so you might have false information. By getting a book you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them over night it @MONTH1 take a month or two but if we act new we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without then very easily, and without them the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer. If you are stuck on a computer for @NUM1 hours a day you will never have any family memories. All you will remembor is when you were on the computer, and who wants that.
<START>

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you think that children spend to much time on the computer. The issue that is going around is @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books @CAPS2 the same thing. I know alot of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more to on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk it was said that, "In @LOCATION1 people are alot over wieght", and it was also said that the number of over wieght people in the world was the of @LOCATION2". So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye. You could be out side learning hand eye coordination. Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around haveing fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're finsh the start playing games or the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can @CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your disicion. @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exerciseing the they @CAPS2 on the computer. Now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know. 
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. First reason is they give the ability to learn about people and places in the world. Another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world. Last reason is it can help you be organize and get a job. Now I will move on to give more details on my first reason. When I have a school project on a famous person or somewhere in the world I know that the computer will give me more information than a book. If I am doing the project on a place and I want to know how far is it from where I live to there or whats the weather of that place all I have to do is type it down in a search engine and the computer will give me a bunch of websites that will answer my question. Now, if you can't draw a picture for your biography project go on a search engine and type down the name of the person you're doing and don't for get to type down pictures or photos and you will see a bunch of pictures of that person. Now I will move on to my second reason. Computers bring unity in the nation and the world for example think about these social networks like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 these networks has millions of people on them that you can talk to. And what about the @ORGANIZATION1, webcam, where you can talk to the person face to face. Just recently there been earthquakes in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3 you can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need. Now I will move on the my last reason. Computers are everywhere there's never a job that does not have a computer. That means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, Computers lately have been considered a distraction and unessasary device. I personally think that they have many things to offer everyone each helps us and understand things and subjects we couldn't understand before. Also computers are now sad to make people lazy or physically unfit but that depends on the person. They could easily go to play and talk with family and friends if they wanted to. Computers are also not becoming a important and learning, making informationeasier to before. The most popular and common of a computer now is communication. Websites are invented on the main idea of communicating. Computers are a important part of the future life that isn't harmful or unnessary. Resently we have been able to use computers in so many helpful ways. Learning and studying new and important things. Researching and collecting data to cure a desies to working on a machicene. They are now a important and useful part of jobs people have now. Almost anything published or shown to the public went through a computer. So people 's jobs on computers working and learning. Like a job you print out a paper every week or day even. You use computers to edit and put together your paper before printing. So basic computer skills are important for people to have for new jobs and common ones you see everyday. Computers are rumored also to be too time consuming and unhealthy for a person. Computers are a optional thing for people to use in their own time required to do. The person could go out and see friends and family. Go to the gym, a vacation without a computer. Yes they are fun to use they have a lot of things to do it isn't needed like air or water. You can live without using a computer for us a week. You can take a walk, read a book, go hangout with your family and won't be pressured for computer time at all. If your worried about it take a break from it for a while. You can do things without a computer. Learning with computers is thing lately, in @CAPS2 they're going in the computer lab learning to read on or other programs. Studying or writing essay in my grade mostly. Researching for a class and making a project. Computers are useful in school. You also read about new subjects and learn new things on computers possibly helping you in your classes or. The biggest use of computers now is communication through many websites like youtube, facebook, myspace and many others. They allow people to communicate their ideas and opinions. Talk to far away friends and family without high phone bill. Seeing politics and daily news to the weather. Almost all means of communication can be done with a computer. So now you see computers are a vital and useful of daily technology we have at reach. It is not unhealthy or time consuming unless you are allowing your computer usage to be that.

Letter to the @CAPS1 I disagree with the so-called "experts" that claim that computers could have negative effects on people. The idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a pathetic arguement. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 allow @CAPS22 with all your friends @CAPS4 and other online games help you met new people that could be hundreds of miles away from you! Twiter is good when you just want to say something quick like "@CAPS5 to @LOCATION1". @CAPS18 allows you to talk to friends, comment on their videos, and subscribe to them, plus it provides hours of entertainment without a fee. Computers also can provide fun games and entertain users. There are many free games, like @PERSON1, that have endless possibilities. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 (made by @CAPS6) claims to be the most popular @CAPS7 (@CAPS8 @CAPS9 Online @CAPS10-playing @CAPS11) on the web. You can level up combat skills: attack, defence, strength, ranged, and magic. Or you can level up skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. @PERSON1, like most @CAPS4, has quests, with varying difficulties. For example, for one quest you have to kill a demon, but for another, just find a missing cat. There are over @NUM1 quests, and there are never fewer than @NUM2 people playing at a time. Some other notable @CAPS13 games are @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15, @CAPS16 of @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1. As you can see, the computer has an impressive list of entertaining @CAPS11 for all ages, not to mention sites like @CAPS18 or addicting games. Computers don't really affect exercising. That's a personal choice, so you have to choose between @CAPS2 or the basketball court. It's like saying that before we had computers or video @CAPS11 consoles, that a @CAPS20 board stopped kids from exercising. The computer doesn't actually stop us from exercising. It's our minds that do, and our judgement. If you have bad judgement, you'd stay inside all day tweeting and @CAPS21. With a good strong mind and willpower, you can overcome a bad decision and play sports or go to the gym. All it takes is good judgement. Just to recap what I've said, @CAPS22 is plenty on computers and there are many choices on how to do it. Many sites amuse us, and we should make use of that. Not to mention you can buy games like @CAPS16 of @CAPS17 or @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15 for your @CAPS13! Computers don't actually hinder exercising, all it takes is good judgement to get off that chair and exercise.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 having everything known to man at your fingertips. @CAPS4 having an endless source of information in your own home. Wouldn’t you want all of this all the time? The question then is, do computers have positive effects on people? I strongly believe computers do benefit society. Firstly, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. The main way is by typing. When you type, you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys. Also, computer games teach hand-eye coordination. If you weren't looking at the screen, would it be possible to win the game? When computers teach you hand-eye coordination, you can use it for other things too. For example, you definitely need it in sports or more. Specifically, baseball. If you didn't have good hand-eye coordination, you wouldn't be able to catch the ball or be able to hit the ball when you swing. Hand-eye coordination very important. Secondly, computers give people the ability to form about places and people. When people are deciding when to get vacation, they go in the internet. What there is in do. Why would you travel in a place is you back. Many use the internet in research other countries. When the eight grade did reports their information. Eighty seven percent the internet. Finally; some people say computers take away from interaction with family and friends, but computers actually allow you to tell with other family and friends around the world. Wouldn't it be wonderful to with your loved ones in a different state of country? The main way of online communication is @CAPS5-mail or @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These allow you to send someone a message faster and easier. It is much easier in remember someone @CAPS5-mail address than it is a phone settle for just talking, when you can actually see the person? It would be like them being in the room with you. Computers are a great way to talk to someone. Why wait any longer? Computers are a great way to refine your hand-eye coordination skills. You can research Faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe. Most importantly, you can communicate with family and friends online through @CAPS8, @CAPS5-mail, or @CAPS10. Definitely, computers benefit society. So go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive.

Computers do not have a negitive effect on people. They keep you in touch with family, help you do work for school, also allow you to play video games and look up music. Computers can keep you in with family and friends. Find locations to where the live. How their doing and what have they been up to. It allows you to e-mail and lets you see friends that moved far away. Computers also help you to work for school. They help you find answeres to questions a teacher could ask. They help you write reports or reports in general for any subject. Also, there many site that you could go to; to help you with a book.The sites could also bring you to your schools website. That way, if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check. Even if you were absent most papers I questions are on the internet so you could make end to the homework. Another common thing computers are used ten is to weecth movies. Rather a old movie or a new release. Computers also do the same thing for music. Anything from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country and back can be. or new @CAPS3 shows and music all be find. Video games are also popular. Many people play these because; people can friends. Talk to friends that they havent seen in a long time. They to not be bored. If it's raining out and nothing to to the here games. And if you one to talk to thiers always someone there to lister to you and maybe become your friend. So computers are not a waste. They can keep you in touch, you new friends get rid of find an serches everything in @CAPS4 shows, music and movies.

Dear, Local Newspaper I think that it would be better if people get outside to get so exercise and enjoy nature to interacte with there family and friends. If you get out with your family and friends maybe more teens and adults would be in better shape and more healthly. Say we jump out of bed, gets some breakfast and head to the park to gets an excrize with your family and friends. Alot of family and friends i think spend way to much time on the computers or there labtops because if they are on the computer to long then they will not want to go outside and get excrise with there friends. More and more people use the computer. But not everybody agrees on this statement. What I think it would be better to solve the problem and have everybody get outside and get some freshair with family and friends. But some people don't think that is the right thing to go. People that think those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Well I don't think that is the way to go because you need to get outside to get some. Freshair with people. But if you want to go on the computer you can but I think it should be only for a little bit then because some people have a bissness that they have to work on when they are at work. Sometimes people have to work on there computer every day so if that is the case they I think they should be alouded to use the labtop or computer. But if you are a teen you should only go on if you have to f you needing the internent or writeing a paper. But if you going to go on to just go on to just talk to friend then that is a waste of time in somebody life. Well at least my life it is. I think as a teen you shold be to work on studying on doing your homework instead of being on the computer because I think it would be better to make sure your grade are not making you fail in your school carvee in life. So that is why it is best to make sure you aren't on the computer all the time talking to your friends on the computer all day because it could make you fail in life. I would only go on for a little bit to talk to your friends. That is why I think it is not right to spend all your time on the computer. Jump outside and in goal the outside weather with friends and family meabers. I hope teen and adult get outside from now on because it would be better for allof us and everybody would be heathly. If they tri this program. If you tri this program it will really work to all of you tri proise it will work and you will be heathly and not feel bad about yourself.

Dear to whom this @MONTH1 concern I know everybody that dont uses computers are why are people effect by the computers. Well i think computer is better then newspaper, on news papers you could find the news, well of course but wheather, houses for sale, tv casting, jobs and others just the same way as @CAPS1 but instead it like virtual. It benefits society for certain reasons it depends. some times computerscan be a negative effects on people but it also teach people how to read, write, type, learn and other. What I about we can talk to others we can see pictures of people whom we no we can google into about things we need to no, it helps when they need to find they way around the mapquest. A negative issue with having computers with internet, certain websites that are not age able. Kids be on website thier parents dont bout, looking up with boys they meet over the @CAPS1, People dying making plans with someone the next day the person is gone missing. I think if experts take away computers must kids well be mad and upset and there will be nothing more to do but play video games and go outside and these are my opinions.

Computers are helpful in everyone's life. New things can be learned from them. They can provide a way to contact others. And they make writing a lot easier. Overall, they have a good effect on the world. Technology lets everyone explore new topics. If something is typed into @ORGANIZATION1, results will pop up within seconds. Click on these, and information that is needed is displayed. The computer is also helpful for research papers. The internet allows a more elaborate final draft. Learning benefits a grade in school or in work. It is always good to be able to contact anyone who is wanted. With the computer, people are abel to @CAPS1, talk on @CAPS2, or even talk to a loved one on a webcam. On @CAPS2, pictures be added so anyone who wasn't able to be at an event can now see what is was like. Webcams hooked up to the computer let people talk face to face with someone else they might not have seen in months. These are all good examples of why computers have a positive impact on the human race. Writing out papers can be a hard, tedious task. On the computer, it is possible to type out words and not have to get out on eraser for an spelling mistakes. These are picked up by spell check. This way, no points are deducted for wrong spellings. Sometimes people @MONTH1 have sloppy handwriting. These dificulties can all be solved by a typing program on the computer. Therefore computers must have a positive effect on people. They teach new things. They allow people to contact others who are far away. They can also make grading a paper easy. This concludes that computers benefit the society we live in today.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has been brought to my attention that why on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside. The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers, rather than enjoying the day. Computers are negatively affecting the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutley crazy if nothing is done about this. For one the @LOCATION1 has the most obese children in the world. Generally children should be running around burning off their calories; even some people in their teen years should. Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such. Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day. The whole screen thing brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain, what computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child ceizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer, with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that everytime you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk. The longer youre on the more and more and more radiation is going to youre brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself, it could almost be called suicide because if youre reading this than you've been warned. So we've basically covered the effects that computers have on your body physically. The computer can also effect you mentally and socially. When @DATE1 comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose @PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school. Its been proven that computers cause memory loss. So what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on, frustrating isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could've gained knowledge rather than using it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer, would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. Its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you.

Dear editor, Computers are becoming more and more prevalent in the @LOCATION1. Peolple are spending too much time on computers instead of on other activities, an effect not beneficial to society. Because of computers, people have lacked exercise, missed enjoying nature and other parts of the world and forgotten about interacting with family and friends. Computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives. First of all, computer users receive significantly less exercise than those who do not use computers. According to a survey done by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only @PERCENT1 of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week. In contrast, @PERCENT2 of non-computer users (non-frequent computer users) reported that they exrcised at least once every week. Can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user? Nearly everybody would be overweight, lethaigic from lack of sleep due to hours on the computer, and unworldly. Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone's life, and lacking it could be deleterious to one's health. Hopping off the computer and instead getting exercise, would make for a healthier and more fit country. Not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise, but they also prevent people from enjoying nature and other parts of the world. By traveling to @CAPS1 and unfamiliar places in the world, one is able to experience and learn about other cultures. Going on the internet @MONTH1 be a decent way to learn about other places, but actually feeling the ambiance and environment of a foreign place is allows for a much more profound understanding of another place. For example. when I went to @LOCATION2 for a vacation, I learned about the differences in traditions and culture. I saw the separation between the poor and the rich when I lookes from humble sharks along the river to the portentous, eregant edifices scraping the sky. It was an experince I could not encounter on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer, but through the screen of one's eyes. Lastly, computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends. From my personal experiences, I tend to ignore friends and family. Speaking, playing, and generally socializing with others is a critical part of everyone's life. Without this basic necessity people cannot be happy. In summary, computers should not be used in excess. This sort of use could read to people getting less exercise, not fully experiencing the world, and closs of interaction with friends and family. To make a better country and nation, the people of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce computer use.

Dear Newspaper I think that computers have a positive effect on people, here are my reasons. You can get in contact with people, if you have a question you can look it up and you can do your job on a computer. I think that these reason will have you positive too. Many people like computers and have one. My first reason is you can get in toch with friends and family. I think this is a good reason because if your grandmother lives in @LOCATION2 you don’t want to drive there every time you want to see her when you live in @LOCATION1. You would use the computer to live chat with her so you wouldent have to drive all the doun there. If you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her. You would use a computer to get in touch with friends. If you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it. That is my first reason why computers have a positive way on people. My second reason is if you have a computer you can look up questions that you would have. If you needed to know some thing for a big report and none of your friends are up you can look up your computer. Computers can help you so much if you need an answer. If you didet hav a computer if you would be so hard to do stuff. That is why I think that computer can answer your questions. My third reason is you can work on the computer. If your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances. A lot of people work on the computer to save the envirment. When I grow up I’ll probaly work on the computer because it is easer. That is why I think that you can work on the computer. The reason I picked were you can get in tuch with family and friends, you can look up a question that you might have, and you can work on a computer. I hope you have a positive way on computers they help you out. People might think that they not your brain not they don’t help and knoledge you. Many people like and have one. I think that you should have a positive way on computers too.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at my school sit on there computers after school. They don't go outside and enjoy nature. Visit with family and friends or even exercise. @CAPS2 people are affected by this. Going outside can enchance your knowledge, you can go on a walk in the woods. When you are on your walk you @CAPS2 find interesting new species. Also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings. @CAPS2 times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids, you can start a pick of game of baseball. You can also build new things. You could find a big tree and build a treehouse or tireswing with your family. Going outside leaves you with a lot of fun activites. When kids sit on the computer they don't interact with there family or friends. During the @DATE1 you can go to the beach with your friends. It will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner. You @MONTH1 also find the oportunety to go to a different state for the day. Or you could go acros the country to see your sick grandma or your newly named cousin. Going on a picnic will give you time to get to know new people. You could invite friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to met. You will also have a lot of tasty food and who wouldn't want that? Going places with your family and friends can pad to a worth wild experinse. @PERCENT1 of kids chose to go on the computer than to exercise. Kids will become overweight. When on the computer @CAPS2 kids will eat. Eating for hours each day to not a good idea. You can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country. Once you are on the team you will make new friends, and get your exercise for the day. When you are on a team and exercising you will learn @CAPS2 life skills. You will learn the benifits of working as a team and by yourself. So getting your exersise is a very important role in your life. Why would you choose the computer? You wouldn't be able to enjoy the outdoors. Or spend time with family and friends. You would become over weight and unhappy. So, don't choose the computer, choose another activity!

To @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS2 I have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly disagree, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Having computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about @CAPS3 and faraway places and even allow people to talk online with friends or family. Don't you want your children to grow up with great hand-eye coordinatio? More than @PERCENT1 parents voted yes. As shown in many statistics, adults and children that use the computer for an hour or more a day have better hand-eye coordination than a normal adult or child that only uses @CAPS6 once a week. By using the computer for more than one hour a day your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase. Not only does typing quicker effect your computer techniques but @CAPS6 also helps you outside of your home like in sports. For exsample, if you play the sport baseball, the speed of your pitch will increase over @PERCENT2 if you use the computer for over a hour a day! If your a batter your racation to the pitch will also increase by over @PERCENT2! Just by using computer. Is time running out for your @CAPS3 project to be do? Without computers, you wouldn't get the information you need quick enough. Dr. @DR1 from @ORGANIZATION1 state "You can get the same information on people other countries, and @CAPS3 from the computer as you can . By using the computer you get the as a book and easy. In addition, you have to buy books to get their information unlike computers where they dont you look up the you and in expensive, dont settle for less get the best! Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with. By having a computer you can chat with them through your webcam! Instead of calling them up or sending them an email you could chat with them and still see them in the flesh! Several computer owners say, "@CAPS5 like your actually hanging out with them!" @CAPS6 takes over @NUM1 days at least to recieve a letter back or an email from them if they live faraway with computers @CAPS5 instant ! Wouldn't you like to talk to friends and family every day instead of waiting around for a call, email, or letter? I think yes. All in all , having computers is a great investment. I would also like to point out that without computers you wouldn't beable to talk with friends/family online, get better hand-eye cordination, or even have the ability to learn about @CAPS3 in just a click of a button! Isn't this what you want?

Dear Newspaper editor, Have you ever been working on a paper, or reading something and theres that word you've never heard before? And you just cant figure it at? There where a computer can help you. Yes, some people do waste all their time, online but they have issues. Computers help us with all of our school projects and get research. You can @CAPS3 reconnect woth old friends that you havent sen in years, learned many good things with the internet and computers. First off we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers. @CAPS1 us school projects, I use @ORGANIZATION1 word and powerpoint all the time. Our teachers prefer us to do that instead of handwriting evert thing. Getting information on the computer is so much faster and easier I mean the time it would take, you to look up the word "elephants" the encyclopedia is probably @NUM1 times more that it takes to it in can google. Plus there about @NUM2 1/@NUM2 seconds google call all up millions of websites just what "elephants". Another reason way computers are very beneficial is you can reconnect the old friends you havent seen or talked for a years. You can @CAPS3 meet new @CAPS1 us dating and facebook especially is three things and theres websites like twitter where you can follow celebrities and @CAPS2, computers are internet gives great information people. Some kids take online @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that does recieves around computers to do really have a choice. So in conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to lets of people I know its not a good thing to sit there all day and play cmputer games, but we lets of things accomplished, like school projects, or any project really. Its @CAPS3 nice to meet up with someone you havent talked to in a while sometimes. We have learned many great things from the internet. I hopre you consider my opinion.

Dear editor @ORGANIZATION2 the source, @CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers. This is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health, safety and education. To open my statements, overuse @ORGANIZATION2 the computer con lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1 and plays games, goes on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely gets any excersize and he almost never sees daylight. @PERSON1 @LOCATION1 gained @NUM1 pounds, which lead to obeisity and heart problems. He even wears wooden teeth because his general hygene declined as well. Another common health problem that developes from excessive use @ORGANIZATION2 the computer is arthrietis. Dr. @PERSON3 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION1 told @ORGANIZATION3, "The massive amounts @ORGANIZATION2 typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthrietis, and other joint related problems." In fact, a study that took place from @DATE2 to @DATE3 to see the long lasting terms @ORGANIZATION2 computer overuse had some shocking results. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain. These health risks are a concern, but peoples safety is on bigger issue. When people excessively use the computer they put their safety and well being at risk. People have had serious injuries and scams placed on them because @ORGANIZATION2 the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2. She met a man on @CAPS4.com named @PERSON6, who persuaded her into meeting him at an airport. From their she was taken to @CAPS5 and held from ransom. Every time people use their computer, they put themselves at risk. Dr. @PERSON4 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION2 claims, "I @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 internet-related kidnappings & other crimes. The victim was a person who overused the computer and frequented the internet. Safety is one @ORGANIZATION2 the most important things in life. But peoples education is also effected. When people overuse the computer they can impact their education. The internet hold false information and can be a waste @ORGANIZATION2 peoples time. When students are working on a report, they very often use the internet to get information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are most commonly used. This can be a big problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 information on the internet is wrong? Thats more than half @ORGANIZATION2 it! The internet can also be a time waster. My bro, @PERSON2, had on assignment to do @DATE1. He stood up @NUM3 hours using @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay. He recieved a zero on that grade. In closing, overusing your computer can cause health problems, put your safety at risk, and hurt your education.

Dear editor, Have you ever used a computer? Odds are you have, which means you know how convienient and positive computers are. Did you know @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 use computers regularly? These technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn, showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people. Who hasn't ever played a game on a computer? Computers provide many forms of entertianment, such as games, music, and videos. I once has to drive @NUM1 hours to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer, that I played games and watched movies on. Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities. Of course, try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling @NUM2 @CAPS2, which is computers positively affect me. It was @NUM3 on a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was just about to have a baby. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were there to witness this baby coming into the world because the all live on the other side of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS3, this minor set back did not prevent them from seeing the @LOCATION1 baby, and thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer many ways to be social, such as social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born. there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convienient for all. Last but not least, computers are not only a fine tool for school, but are necessary to succeed with your education. One snows day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. Too bad I didn't know one thing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to take out some books for my report but due to the snow, the library's power went out and therefore they were closed. This was not an issue, though, beacuse I only had to spend @NUM5 minutes on a computer searching for information, instead of spending hours browsing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many helpful purposes for people. These marvelous machines can provide entertainment, socialize with people around the world, and even provide information on any topic you would like. @ORGANIZATION1 readers, now you understand why computers are positive for your lives and everyone elses. I encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone, so they know all the benefits to using computers.

For most people education is very important to but since kids don't stay in school @NUM1 they use the computer to teach to kids kids can learn about other places. This benefits us because we're learning something and growing out our knowledge. Also kids can do their projects. For example writing on essay, their science fair project and so on.

These have been many advancements on computer technology and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it. In against it and ill you why. You spend less time exercising which you'll gain weight. Spend less time enjoying nature which means youre lost with anything natural, an spend less time with friends and family which probbaly prove you, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 not saying the computer is a bad thing but to much of it certaintly is. First, you spend less time exercising. you don't exrcise you gain weight, you could do most of the stuff you could of , and you risk health. This is a bad thing because your not yourself anymore and if it goes to far you can't even a move. So if this sounds scary plan your time on the computer, so it doesn't happen to you, time is so limited that we waste it on stuff in computers so think before you go on the computer maybe you can go for a jog outside. Next, you spend less time playing nature. Nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing. There are only a few hundred maybe they said of us these truly help the environment, and if you think then few hundred of thousand people is alot . @NUM1.billion people of earth. Its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die, while most of us do nothing to help. Finaly, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most important reason of all. The main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world. Your friends important them. Your family might leave you if you your life to the computer if you they you so be carfully. Your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh. have good times and cheer you up when you upset. Just don't forget that as be gone. Well, there you have it my three reasons for being against work on the computer and they all sound like a good reasons so lets recap it all shall we. First, spend less time exersing, very important. Next spend less time enjoying nature, very important. Finaly less time with friends or family the most important of all. So hoped you enjoyed my essay and you've learned something . So remember to much of good thing is bad and I'll just leave you with .

Dear editor: @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION2 have comuters? These computers are definatley benefitting society. People need computers to get updated on important issues, contact others and learn new information. Computers are neccisary for everyday life. It's very important that news gets around, and one way for it to do that is by computers. Average people like me and you need to know the weather, global issues and many other important topics. If you use the computer to get updated on important issues you will be able to acess the information right away. For example there is no need to wait for the weather to come on the television when you can find out the weather for your local area withen seconds. Just recently there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and million of civilians died. if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in @CAPS2 people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated. Not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues but it is also a great way to contact people. My relatives live very far away and we can't afford the long distance phone call charge and so we e-mail them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people contact far away friends and family by e-mail! The computer is also a great place for friends to contact each other through social networking sites, such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. People need to interact with other people and the internet is a fantastic place to do that. Finally computers can also be used to learn new information. If children need to find inforamtion for a project or essay the can easily search the internet and find an answer. Kids need to acess the information that is neccisary for school on the internet. Computers are useful for adults as well. If adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer. It's so much easier than going out to the library and finding that information in a book. @CAPS1 you know that most adults use an online dictionary to find the definition to a word? Computers can find every answer to your questions. In conclusion, computer are really benefitting society. Computers can update you on important issues, help you contact people, and find out new informatiuon. These avandces in technology are good for human society.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 home computers is a good thing for many reasons. One reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people. People can also use computers to type and save paper. Also, people can use computers to talk to people living close or far away from you. Finally, computers can save paper by replacing books. One @MONEY1 the most important reasons why people need computers is because computers can help you learn about and research other things going on in the world. If a student needs to research a country and write a paper about it for school, it is much easier and faster to use a computer than to look through a textbook.Computers are also better and faster than a textbook if you want to know more about a person or a culture. Using computers to type are also faster than writing a paper. Using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper. When you are typing a paper, you don't have to worry about @CAPS1 handwriting or breaking your pencil. You also don't have to worry abut spelling something wrong because computers can check you spelling and grammar. What you are writting a paper you have in about all @MONEY1 these problems and more. You also have to spend money on pencils and other writting suppplies. Computers also saved people @MONEY1 becase they didn't need to buy paper to make textbooks. Computers also evolved how people can communicate with each other. Before computers were invented, you couldn't talk to people in other countries unless you paid to use a phone or sent them mail. Now, you can send instant mail which saves days @MONEY1 time and paper. You can also use webcams to talk to family members and people you don't know. That can save you a lot @MONEY1 money because you don't have to pay money for postage stamps, phone calls, or plane rides to visit them. Those are some @MONEY1 the best reasons why @CAPS1 a home computer is better than not @CAPS1 one. A home computer can save you time when you want to research a country, person, or culture. They can save you money because you don't have to buy postage stamps, pay for phone calls, or pay for plane rides to visit someone from a different state or country. Computers also help save paper because you no longer need to make large textbooks or use a different price @MONEY1 paper when you make a writting mistake.

In my opinion I agree that it benefits society. The reasons that support my decision are lots of buisnesses use computers to work, fast food resturants use computers, and schools use computers. Computers are all needed just for those reasons. My first reason is buisneses use computers to work. Workers use computers for designing, filing peoples names, and to type papers, and essays. People in the designing industry don't use paper and pencil anymore, because they use designing softwares to work. Instead of filing in a cabinet people and workers use computers to put their patients, clients, and workers. Computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can. People also type papers and essays for work. For example, news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish. If workers in buesness were to need to use computers to file, type, and design clothes and games. My second reason is that fast food resrurants or even resturants use computers, instead of using cash registers. For example @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 use technology to type in peoples orders, and amount they pay. Back then they used to use cash registers, in order to get money out they need to click a button, but now the have all locked up using computers. Every resturant has at least a touch screen computer in it to use. So resturants need computers to survive the world. My third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports, file the students name and grades into it. Students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work. Teachers need computers to file the students name, grades, and information, instead of using a cabinet. Teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word. So schools use and need computers for students and teachers use. In conclusion I agree that computers benefit society, because buisnesses need them to work, design, and file, and fast food resturants so they can take peoples orders and to use in schools for students and teachers use. So thats why it benefits the society.

Dear @PERSON1, Computers are necessary and benefit our community. They do a great deal to help make our lives easier. There is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another. The benefits of our computers are they connect us, the spread news, and they make every day objects work. Computers connect us in so many difffrent ways. Where would businesses be without computers? Most modern day businesses are run by computers. Owners can now have businesses all over the world. With computers a business in @LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @LOCATION1. They can have live video chats together. With the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world. Even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers. Now a days we do a lot of online shopping. This is an example of how stores connect to their customers. Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations. This can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop. The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. With all these computers many social networking sites are born. The most popular right now is @CAPS1. Students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries. We have a live chat on @CAPS1 or even @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is instant messging which is, well, instant. With a simple click people are connected no matter how far apart they are. Therefore, computers conect people. Computers also broadcast news. Without the computers most of us would not no about world news. This includes the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 they would be in alot more trouble. They would not have all of these donations. Also computers even broadcast national news. Almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too. Anyday now they will be completly online. This will drastically change how we learn about news. It would just be a click away. What would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds. Science also benefits from computers. Phones now can be personal tws, inernet, and messaging devises. Phones are just a tiny version of a computer. Cars also have computers put into them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Also, in cars there are computers to run just about everything else. So, there is not a day where we do not incounter computers. In conclusion, computers benefit us in so many ways. They conect us deliver news, and are in almost all of our technology. Could you imagine life without computers?

Do you know that square box with a screen on @CAPS11? Or that rectangular snaped objected with letters on @CAPS11? Or that other rectangular box where you put a disk, a usb, and you turn @CAPS11 on at. All that is a computer. Yes! @CAPS11 is fun, you @CAPS3 play games, go on internet, watch videos, and check your mail. If you had a computer everything would be easy but @CAPS2 nor. @NUM1 reasons why is if you have kids and they go on your computer you have at home @CAPS11 @CAPS3 cause them addiction, @CAPS11 @CAPS3 be inaproprite, and @CAPS11 could be exspensive. Pleases near my reasons and give me a fighting chance. The first reason why computers are bad because @CAPS11 @CAPS3 cause addition to your child. @CAPS12 a problem because your child bother you and say, "@CAPS1 or @CAPS7 @CAPS3 I go on the computer pleace". And you say yes and when you let thom on they will be happy when you say. "@CAPS2 time to act off the computers" they will say "@CAPS3 I stay on just for a little longer or I dont wanna act off @CAPS4 in a middle of a game." @CAPS5 when they finnally act of and thir nexted day they will ask you again "@CAPS6 or @CAPS7 @CAPS3 I go on the computer" and if you say "@CAPS8" they will cry and throw a temper And the more you let them on the they will wanna stay @CAPS9 if you say, "@CAPS8" you will get a The second reason why @CAPS2 a bad thing to have a computer is because @CAPS11 @CAPS3 inaproprite, @CAPS11 @CAPS3 be inaproprite because you child is growing up he or she will go ento the internet and lat a things like nude pictures or videos about a or a that world to lead your child having sexual intercorse. There you will but at the age of @NUM2 to @NUM3 years old and you they of inaproprate a computer @CAPS3 do. @CAPS9 last but not least the last reasons why a computer is bad because they are computers cost about @MONEY1 more a days and you @CAPS3 broth your computer and @CAPS11 will cost you a lot get @CAPS11 fixed or to get a new one and they will be on @CAPS11 even more or they @CAPS3 press @CAPS11 up trust me I know. @CAPS5 @CAPS12 why a computer isnt always a good thing. Now that you hav heard my reasons I hope you take this info consederations and think about @CAPS11 you really want a computer or not they are good and easy but they also have some bad side effects. All the facts are true ans I say about @NUM4 people in the world go threw computers every year @CAPS5 think hard. Do you

Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely usefull tool in this modern age. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. Therefore, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master. Without it they will have sloppy handwriting, absolutely no chance at sports, and much more. Computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees. And because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster. Computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places, people, etc. People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. Now that information is only a few clicks away. Say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps drippy but you dont want to pay for a plumber. You could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. Finnaly, Computers can allow people to stay in contact with friends who @MONTH1 live far away. It is more convinient than using a plane because you dont have to have something in your hands the whole time. You can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message. It is also very usefull for people such as buisnesmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @PERSON1, author of buisnes magazine tells us in an iterview that it is nearly imposible to run a succesfull buisnes without a computer. How people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, I dont know. But I hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necesary.
<START>

I think having computers are good because you can use it to find places. Another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer. You can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework. That is why computers are good and we need them. First reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us. Also we could look at places we never saw before and if you want to get some where you can go the computer to do that.
<START>

There are over @NUM1 students at @ORGANIZATION2. & out of @NUM2 students have computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. Students who use computers are more skilled than kids who don't by learning all the software and hour to be safe when online. Computers teach kids hand eye coordination, which can come in handy when playing sports. Also they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Finally it allows people to talk online with other people. Computers make people develop hand eye coordination. When someone plays a sport live baseball or basketball, hand eye coordination is definetly needed. say your a catcher, and then catch it. Almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it. Hand-eye coordination can also be useful to people with jobs. If you work with computers for a job, it is helpful to be well known wit the keyboard for fast results. Mostly any job along with sports requires hand-eye coordination. Some people have the gift that they have hand-eye coordination when there born, but for people who don't practice is the best thing. Learning about faraway places/ people is always facinating. On computers towns can put up webpages with pictures, information or even ways to help you plan a vacation. Theres also @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place. Computers even give you the abilty to plan or visit a loc location by buying tickets online or maybe you just want to read what the place is like, you can do all that. Finally, computers can be taken any place with you and say you go to @LOCATION1, and you don't speak there language, well you can go to a translating site and figure out what things mean. Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, all of these sites make it possible for you to talk with other people. Personally, I have a facebook, aim, and even a e-mail. A lot of the time I will go on facebook and talk to my friends from school and even my cousins that I don't get see a lot. Talking online helps you interact with other people that you might not see in school or around town, and also your friends that might not have a cell phone. It helps you learn social skills that everyone needs. Computers give you all that. Its easy and free way to talk to anyone you know whenever you want. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. Almost everyone uses computers, and they aren't difficult to use. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best things that has ever been made.

Dear editor, I have read your past article about how computers can take too much time out of some ones life! time they could be cseing to exercise or on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This is completly untrue and in many ways actually benerfits society. The internet is d fast d simple way to shorten the time spent doing activites we would already do. Instead of sending d letter to someone to invite them to the @CAPS3 you could just email them. Letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly. Also what if the movie sells out or is canceld, don't worry with the internet you can reschedele and buy tickets online. So that doesn't happen again. Suddenly your phone rings, its d call from your best friend saying to turn on the news, but you have to leave to pick up your kids in three minutes. Instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and , you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early. Have you been dieing to talk to someone haven't seenin a long time. Well with one of the many free websites like @CAPS4 and facebook go can do htat in d heart beat. You can talk to that person and find many race. Also if you've been feeling lonely, like you can't find the right person. With dating sites you can find the perfect person and maybe go to the @CAPS3 with them. Not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically. Acording to drishnig at @ORGANIZATION1 people who use computers for at least @NUM1 mintes a day have d @PERCENT1 increase in hand ey corodination relaction time and accuracy. Although home say it's bad for your eyes that is a lie, it was proven by @PERSON1 the @CAPS5, bestead of health who has @NUM2 degres in science and health.
<START>

To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside. However, it has kept kids inside instead @ORGANIZATION2 on the streets causing trouble. Computers have become a part @ORGANIZATION2 our everyday life. Some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends. Experts say it's bad but the @ORGANIZATION2 gives us a computer class in @ORGANIZATION1? We learn keyboarding skills. @ORGANIZATION3 techniques and how to research any topic. @ORGANIZATION1, itself has influenced computer use. If we could travel back in time, we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets. Now-a-days, kids spend a lot @ORGANIZATION2 time inside, on the computers. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I bet you, or your parents, or maybe even your grandparents used to hear @ORGANIZATION2 gangs or fights going on in the streets. Now that computers have become an important item in many people's lives you don't hear those types @ORGANIZATION2 things as much. I'm not saying they don't happen but you don't hear your child come home and talk about gangs and fights. Therefore, being on the computer isn't that bad. In history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to @LOCATION1 to get away from their ruler. Well, not everyone was able to come. Some people have family in another country. Due to time difference, it is hard to stay in touch. My mother came over here when she was @NUM1. The rest @ORGANIZATION2 her family still lives in @LOCATION2. To stay in touch they email or @CAPS1 chat. The five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call. The invention @ORGANIZATION2 computers has made it easier to catch up with family! Most importantly, the use @ORGANIZATION2 computers is influenced in schools. My @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, has a computer class, where we learn how to skillfully type. We are also taught how to correctly cite and research work. This is helpful because if we don't know this information we could plagiarize and plagiarism is illegal. Frequently, teachers give us projects that ask for computer use.. Either we have to look something up for specific, accurate information or we have to type a @ORGANIZATION3 document. As well as using the the online @CAPS2 book instead @ORGANIZATION2 taking it home. After reading all the facts, I'm sure you will agree that computers can benefit society. Students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home. People won't feel like they've left or lost their family. Schools influence computer use to help us learn. Certainly you cannot disagree with me!

Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 people believe that computors are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend to much time on the computor. Computors are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic. Not only does the computor help communication but it also helps us gain information on modern day society like the news to stay up-to-date. This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out. One main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have ocurred like an incident or an up coming event. @CAPS2 experts like @PERSON1, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obeisity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone. Online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life. A computor can give us certain information like news and whether report. These days every smart person would go search information on a computor for not only missed news but for future forecast on whether to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computor can send data to a computor to conviently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computor. The computor can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture. You could send that file and listen to it on another computor. Now is the time to decide if you should support computors. The computor can help you talk to long lost friends of one touch of a button. If you need certain information than you could find it on a computor without ever leaving your comfortable home. last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work. So go and type that letter to a representative to help people see that computors are good for our society.

Computers. First of all. I strongly beleave that people should not use computers all the time. Staying up to late, like on a school day and your tired. Your eyes look at black & white words that can make your tired, forcing to stay up, and drinking red bull monster, or any other energy drink when your not suppose to. Second of all, almost the hole school use's the labtops, and the computers like @PERCENT1 use's them. The othe <@PERCENT2@NUM1> is students and adults write on paper, and that has good hand and combination. the @PERCENT1 is like all people go online, facebook, youtube, games, and google. The @PERCENT2 is all people use to write on their paper, and doodle on the back round. Third of all. In other state's people don't have enternet service, or they can't use computer. People have to write their work on a piece of paper. Some kids, youngadults, adults, and students sometimes have bad hand writing. I think all people should not have a computer.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers are good for people. I believe this because many people get to see things that on their daily basis wouldnt. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that many people now a days work alot so they might not have time to remember little things such as going to buy newspaper or they might not even have time to watch the news on tv, but because of computers they can read or see the same things but in less time. Some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working. This benefits sociaty its own way. I believe computers are very useful to everyone. C omputers can help people get in touch. They can keep in touch by using webcam and etc. It could also let them communicate. Computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world. It gives people a chanve to see the people you couldnt see from afar. In my opinion people can also learn from computers. Computers have many positive effects that are very important. They give people a chance to learn things. This can benefit sociaty because the more knowledge people have the better it is. It gives people who didnt get a chance to learn what they wanted to actually do so and learn it. Computers do benefit sociaty lets take @PERSON1 for example he says that @PERCENT1 of kids believe that computers have helped them in their own way. Many people can be bored at times but because of computers and the fun things it has such as games, videos... etc.. People get to actually spend some time doing something like @PERSON1 stated kids believe computers are helpful because by playing those games it can give them hand eye coordination and help them in different ways at the sametime. (takes away boredom and lets them get good hand eye coordination) Computers also benefit sociaty by letting people has such technology. Many time technology is needed in everyones life. Technology has helped many people and still continues to. Computers is one of the technology that helps people. Technology can teach people things that they do not even know they could do. In conclusion I believe computers have many great positive effects on people, and it also doesnt only benifit people that use this technology it benifits others in a way too. It gives everyone a chance to learn about things, and do them so I believe computers are a great thing to have.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 a world without computers. Where would we get all of our information from? Would we have to religh on television or magaziens, where information can be changed? Or how would we ever get any reports done for work or home work? I know many people who don't write neat, how will any one read it? Basically, computers effect our lives so much in a good way that it would be chaos with out them. Computers allow people to learn how to type which can improve all around skills such as hand eye coordination, they let us connect with places we are not familiar with and see family members, and they allow people to have an online education which can help with the economy. Computers effect us in a very good way and they change our every day lives, @CAPS2 children these days cannot type. A recent study done at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT1 of kids older than @NUM1 already know how to type on a keyboard. Computers have such a big effect on us with so many skills that people don't ignoledge enough. Because all of thoes kids know how to type, they can spell better too. I remember one time when I was in the middle of writing a report online. I got @NUM2 a word I didn't know and had always had trubble spelling it. So I took my time and typed it out one letter at a time, and it was correct! This example shows that computers can effect everyones lifes, even younger kids. The way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move. For example, when babies learn how to walk the religh on their brains show them how it's done. This is just like how when there is a natural disaster, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 we religh on our computers to show us and tell us what is going on and how something like this could happen. Computers can effect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them. Computers effect families everyday lives by giving them online educations. My @NUM3 year old cusin told me that she was happy her mom could go back to college from home because then they could spend time together. I know you might think that computers can make families get further apart but they actually bring them closer together. There is only one choice and that is that computers effect all of us in a good way. They can help us learn how to type, connect us with our world and bring families closer together. Without computers we wouldn't be the same as we are today.

Dear local Newspaper. I think we should keep improving technolgy on computers. Some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside. I personally think that the computer is important, if people don't use it none stop. There are many reasons wht the computer is inportant. First of all there are many places in the world that not everyone can go to. The internet is a good way to find out about a place. Also if you are going on vacation and you would like to know alittle about the vacation spot you can just look it up on the computer. Another reason is the computer can help you study a place too. Also if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer. If you are disagrreing with someone than you can find quick and easy information. All you do is look up something and you can find it. And you can learn new things that you have no clue about. Most of the time the internet is very helpful. One more reason is communication. On the computer there are many ways you can communicate with other people. If you have friends or family far away then you can keep in touch with them without leaving your house. Also if you are not sure about homework or something like that you can just ask a friend to find out. And you can send pictures or videos to people in order to keep in touch. Sometimes people use that feature for bad or inapropriate things. But you can do something about it so you don't get those bad things. The internet can help you alot in your every day life. You can learn about new places, you can do research, and you can communicate with friends or fumily. If we keep improving technology you will be able to do alot more than you can do now. The internet will be able to help you alot more in your every day life. Now you can see that the internet can help people and its not just keeping people inside that is why I think we should keep improving technology.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, I personally believe that new technology is a great thing. That’s why I think that computers have positive effects on our society. Some of these effects include developing skills to help people for present or future, getting a better education and helping people to become more social. Computers can help people in so many ways you just have to realize it. So come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use. My first reason of why I feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one has and @MONTH1 not realize. For example a teenager @MONTH1 say while typing a paper that she really likes to write. So, she @MONTH1 go on the internet start looking at different styles and maybe she could become a famous journalist. It's all from the skills she got going online and searching what she enjoys. Another situation could be that a man applies for a job and then the employer' says he has to know how to use different softwear, so he could go on the computer and look for a tutorial on that specific softwear. A computer @MONTH1 help people build skills now and for their own future. My second reason of why computers can have positive effects on people is that it can help them get a better education. Any adult who hasn't gone to college and wants to can take classes online and earn their degree way. The education is just for adults; kids can go online and research history of different places they live and want to go. The great thing about you is you can find the information fast and easy. Computers help people learn more and get a better education for themselves. My final reason of why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social. There are so many ways to connect with family and freinds. You can send an email to someone and wait for a reply. Or now, you can even instant message somebody and talk to them like there in the same room. There are also websites, such @CAPS1 facebook, where you can get together and talk with old friends. Computers can help everyone connect with anyone @CAPS1 you can see computers have so many positive effects on people. They can help you build social skills for now and for our future. They can also help people get a better education. Plus, it is a great way to connect with past and present friends. Hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people.

On today's society many new technologys have been released. Such as the @NUM1 player, cell phone, video game counsels such as xbox @NUM2 but probably the most popular and most used is the computer. The ability. and search information in just a couple of clicks. Some people are with technology that they almost get addicted to it and use it every chance they get. Is this good for people is what there doing affecting there health and physical activity. Yes, people these days are affect by the internet greatly. Such websites in once the addiction highly such as facebook, myspace, and youtube. These are probably the is for school. In the @NUM3 years sence facebook. the level increased dramatically and so have the high pressure level! Dr. @DR1 says. This online behavior must stop people are getting addicted and gaining wait from the lock of physical activity. As you can see the online internet can be very use but not something that should be used non stop it can affect you helth and bring other dangers.

Hi! I am writing in which computers are a bad thing to the society or good thing. I think that computers are good thing to have around. They help us in a lot of way and they also help us find new friends and new updates. This is going to be my first opinion. I think that computers have effects on the society in a good way because people can find @CAPS1 of the latest updates on the weather, society and country's. It helps the society in a good way because people don't have to look though an old Newspaper. All they have to do is click and there there reading it all and probally seeing pics and stuff of it. This is my second reason why computers are a good effect on the society they help us in a lot of ways on which meeting new people and staying in close good with them and talking with them and sending pics of stuff and you. My last opinion for computers are a good effect on society is that @CAPS2 you have a buissness or anything you can sell any of your merchandise, keep buiness plans, And also you can make a website for your business after a while @CAPS1 of people will know about it and it would make a really big inpack on your buiness. That was my three opinion on which why computers are good effect on the society and I think that computers are really good effect on the society.
<START>

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think that computers have a positive or negative affect on people's lives? Well if you think it is negative I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand-eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. First, computers teach good hand-eye coordination. While you use computers you are improving your hand-eye coordination. One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger, you move the mouse and click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand-eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all. In fact the are the best bet for a better future.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one? Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have good effects on people such as letting people talkto family or friends that live faraway. Computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world. My first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world. This helps you if you are going on vacation to foreign country you can learn where the test historical sights are and you can also learn where the best hotels are. If you have a project due on a foreign country you can search it up and it will give you all the data you need about it. My second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live faraway. This helps you keep in touch so it doesn't seem like you don't know them any more. Computers can also let you talk to your friends that live faraway and if you want to hangout it would let you talk about which days are good for you and them.

Advancements in technology are very practical and have a positive effect on those fortunate enough to have a computer. First, computers help reach people to have better hand-eye coordination. @CAPS1, computers make it simple to learn new information about many things such as people and places across the globe. finally, computers allow people in different places to communicate instantly for the reasons above, computers are very helpful to people all around the world. One of the ways computers help people is through improving their hand eye coordination when a person learns to type and look at a screen at the same time. They will be able to do sample everyday asks much better. Is a person does not have good hand-eye coordination. They cannot ever make on the ones of a paper properly! This also, with focus, and people with better focus excel in school, work and their social lives. Hand-eye coordination is very important to learn and computers help to teach it to people. The @CAPS1 reason that I think computers people to learn about new. I myself and through have know many proces. My now lucky I to be able to realize how, and the research is because of computers. Computers are aducating. Finally, computers handy because they telephone. One way communication in computers is my instant. This is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation, but free of charge. The final and most popular way is video chat. Video chat is when the people use cameras connected to their computers and can talk to each other while seeing each other's face! All these ways of communicating with people around the world are very beneficial to many people, especially those with family or friends living in another town. Without a doubt, computers benefit people in society in many ways. They teach them hand eye coordination which is very important for simple, everyday tasks they also help people everywhere in the world learn about that they couldnt learn about with books. Last but not least, computers people are world in communicate with each other. In all these ways, computers help people everywhere and.

Dear local Newspaper, I hear you are whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. In my opinion, i think that, yes, they do have a positive effect on people. I think this because @NUM1. Computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. Computers are often helpful to those with special needs, and @NUM3. The computer allows you to connect win people who @MONTH1 live faraway with out having to travel to them. I really enjoy learning about foreign places and culture. I know that from my own experience that the more knoledgable you are about foreign places and culture. The more smart you become overall. Without the computer, many people would not be able to explore these places and learn about them. The computer is basically a big encyclopedia that supplys important information to those who are unable to travel across the world and visit these places. Without computers, people would be less educated about the people, cultures, and the world we live in . Places such as pyrimids in in @LOCATION1, and . Don't you agree? In my school there are several students with special needs. I, personally, can't even begin to imagine how difficult it must be for them to learn. But one thing i do know is that the computer is a very helpful rescource to them. The computer supplies pictures, sounds, and interactive activities that really help kids out. Since some of the kids in my school who have special needs have a hard time reading. The computer helps by reading it aloud to mom. Where would those children be if they didn't have computers? I love keeping in touch with my distent family and friends. Don't you? It used to be that it would take days and days to send and recieve a letter from relative. @MONTH1 because of the computer, hard task can be done with a simple click of the mouse. But thats not all. Besides sending virtual e-mail to people, because of the computer, you see them face to face! Some computers have webcams that allow you to see someone through the screen of your computer, isnt that great?! So, why waste money flying to see someone to deliver a simple message when you can deliver it personally in almost less than @NUM4 seconds? Becaose of the computer, people talk more and are often brought closer together. So, as you can see there are many important positive effects that computers have on people. The reasons being @NUM1. computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. computers are often helpful to those with special needs. And @NUM3. computers allow you to connect with people who @MONTH1 live faraway without having to travel to them. Thank you for listening.

More and more people use computers everyday. Computers are a great help for projects, email, vacation spots, and so on. However, some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer instead of excercising, or taking a walk. I think that computers are an important part of a persons life because the information found on a computer is very useful. It can be useful to you when you have a report coming up. What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do, you don't have time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and get all the information I need. I would also use a computer to learn about far away places, or even famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it. Like, you could find where the best resturant locations are, the best holers, and even the best tourist spots. Computers are also helpful for chating. My grandparents moved so I don't talk to them that much anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick e-mail saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! Thats a lot of work to write down! At some works, the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything thats going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an insentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with. Playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax. Computers are a great help for reports, vacations, chatting, information to help you study for a test. Also to play games on. A lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs. I think computers are an important part of a persons daily life.

In my own opinion, computers are great addition to our world. Computers can help people with schoolwork, communication and entertain you in a safe way. Those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world. First of all, computers help with a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world-wide-web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can't find in books. In addition if a student forgets, losses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be @CAPS1 neat @CAPS1 possible. That is hard for some students,  typing it is neat, and everyone can do it. @CAPS1 you can see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are a great way to communicate and keep-in-touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send some thing to him, he could easily e-mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, the could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up an conference, the teacher could e-mail the parent a time and date. That is why computers are great can easy communication. Lastley, computers provide a safe, fun way or entertainment. Many companies make kid-friendly websites that  go on. For instance, my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kindergardeners who go on these websites, do better in first grade compared to those who don't computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide east communication, and provide safe educational activities, @CAPS1 you can see, computers are a great addition to our world.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people think that computers are used too much, and are helping people become over weight, and even obese. This is maybe true, but computers also teach hand eye coordination, give people the oppertunity to learn about far away places, and people can even coordinate on them! Over all I think computers effect people in a positive way, and these are some reasons why. Computers help teach hand eye coordination. I know your probably thinking “huh? How do computers do that? All your doing is staring at a screen.” But to your dismay computers do teach hand eye coordination. It does this because while playing games, people watch the screen, and click with their hands. They don’t just stare at the mouse while they play these games. By doing so, it teaches hand eye coordination. Scientist have provine that people who own a computer and use it at least @NUM1 hours a week, have better coordination that people who don’t own a computer by @PERCENT1! Just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone. Hand-eye coordination is a thing. It helps you play better in sports like baseball, and not only that but it helps future jobs. As you can tell, @CAPS1, without computers out hand eye coordination. People think that computers are only used for games, but in reality, they teach us @CAPS2 things about the world. Without computers people would know about nearly anything that’s going in other countries. For example, the other day, my mom was checking her email and came access the stay of a young, starving. That are story changer her anyday life because takes food for granted. Without computer my mom would have more in other countries. Because we live in the @CAPS4.S what’s going on in other countries. Are less fortanite, but computer help remind and teach us what’s going in the world everyday. One of the main advantages about computers is they allow people to communicate through them. Even my grandmother said the, without computers, I wouldn’t be as close to you as I am today. “@CAPS5 and my grandmother use the website skype.com. This websit allows you to not only talk to the other person, but to see them too! Because of site like these. I’m allowed to stay in contact, and be able to see my grandmother who lives faraway. Without computers this wouldn’t be possible. Not only do computers let you talk to people far away, but people close too. I often find myself asking friends over the computer, what the homework is, or whens the next test, etc. Computers make it easier to connect to people near and far. In conclusion, computers help in all different ways. The world would be upside down without them. They give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, teach hand eye coordination, and allow people to communicate with each other. Computers have @CAPS2 flaws, but they also have so @CAPS2 positive effects too that I think they shine over all the tiny flaws. Thank you

Dear our local newspaper, Computers have a huge effect on people in a negative way. It could change does lifestyle dramatically. For example, people who sit there all day on the computers spend less of their time exercising, enjoying nature socializing with friends and families. Therefor, computers affect us greatly. One of the reasons why computer once horrible, is because people spend too much time on their computer and don't exercise. It's always important to stay fit and healthy. This could be @PERCENT1 of people who live in the @CAPS1.S is obese. This could a leading of obesity. I can connect to this because i had a relative, who admitted that he gained at least five pounds. for being on the computer @CAPS2, not exercising could. Is it really worth sitting in front of the computer all day eating? There are better entertainment active and will keep us healthy and exercising. Another reason, is that. it seems they're far more in technology you greatly, This will not improve your social abilities. You could lose self confidence in yourself and not be as open as outgoind. None like to be a loner. The feeling could be devastating. @CAPS2. this would make it very difficult to interact and make new friends. It's always a pleasure to know that you have so many lovind people around you. You could lose them with snap of you fingers by spending more time focused no the computer, rather than your friends and family. Lastly, it could be bad to get though life without your friends and family. In conclusion, people who spend too much time on their computer spend less of their time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with friends and families. The computers are like by matter the most in life, to being more focused on them. Computer affect us in a negative way that can change the course of our life.

Dear editor of @LOCATION2 @CAPS1, @LOCATION3's society is being ruined, ruined by computers of course. They are so time consuming that I am afraid they are causing more people to be obease in @LOCATION3. People are afraid that they are limiting themselves from interacting @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, and spending time enjoying nature. I feel the exact same way and someone should put a stop to this! An average american goes on a computer for about @NUM1 hours a day. With going to work or school, and sleeping, that way leaves a litle @NUM2 to go out and explore nature. Our national parks @NUM3's have been decreasing in their numbers of customers at a fast rate. I visited yellow stone last week to find out if as many people have been goind. The man who works at the entrance was saying that "since the start of @DATE1 alone about @PERCENT1 less people have been to @LOCATION1," I believe that the reason for that is because of computers. They limit people from goind to parks or to zoo's, by consuming the public time with all of the "new fashion" or the newest game on miniclip.com. Also, I believe that the public is spending so much time on computers that they are not able to go out and exersize. With the newest "sims game," how are kick supposed to stay fit and healthy? I did a study on how many hour kids spend on thier computer and out of the people who said more than @NUM4 minutes. @PERCENT2 of them could legally considered obease. Is that now we want our next gerneration to be out next president and lawyers, and doctors? @CAPS8, we want them to live life to the @CAPS4 by taking care of themselves by exersizing. Computers are getting kids so consumed that is not ok. Lastly, with computers, families and friends don't really talk to each another @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, or interact with each other at all i mean sure, parents come home to thier child on the computer and give them a kiss on the head. But is that enough? I do not believe it is. I asked a friend of mine's child about how much he interacts with his family and friends? @CAPS2 to @CAPS2 he said that well since he got his new "@CAPS5 @CAPS6 with a @NUM5 gig hardrive", he hadn't been talking to them a whole @CAPS2 to @CAPS2. However, everyday we went on "chat" "for a good @NUM6 hours", to talk to his friends. And only occasionally would he get an @CAPS7-mail or two from his asking how his days was. I do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life. That is what @LOCATION3 has come down to computers. They limit you from interacting to friends and family, give you less time to exersize and limit you from going out and exploring nature. Who knows, maybe at this time in @NUM7 years, @LOCATION3 will be run by computer. Do we want that, @CAPS8! so lets put a stop to it now. Thank you very much!

Dear editor, I believe that computers are a great and fun tool. But I also believe people can spend to much time on them. The computer is excellent. People can use them to type papers or reports, makes graphs, and other important things for us. Schools are using computers more and more now. Schools have websites for students to go to findout there homework, classwork, projects, reports, and extracredit. The school has even started doing something very new, allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online. Not only do the schools help students, but also everyday people help as well. if a student has a project but doesn't know how to start it then he or she can google there project and ways to start it. Computers can be real great and easy to use as you can see, for schoolwork. Computers are not only great for academic purposes, but also for leisure purposes. Before computers and internet, there were only these ways to have fun during boring times in the day. One was watching tv, reading a book, or going outside, if you could. What do I mean by that last sentence? If you lived in a city, then it would be harder to go outside because maybe you lived in an apartment or somewhere not a comunity. Then you couldn't go out; and reading books can become boring after a while, and maybe there was nothing on tv for you to watch. But when computers and internet cameout, people sould play games, watch videos, and talk to cousins or family who live far away. Computers are also good for social networks. Not all familys live close, but are a close family. But in this ec onomy we can't always afford to visit them whenever. So by using computers we can @CAPS1 them facebook them, ,myspace them, and even video chat with them, which as I said is great far away family. But at times people can become to obsesed with them. Some people spend all day on one website, particulary facebook or youtube. Do not get me wrong, these websites are fun and cool. But not cool enough to not go outside and have free, natural fun. I remember I logged into facebook and saw a girl on, I logged off around an hour later and she was still on, then I logged in again around @TIME1 and the same girl was on! That is just to long to be on one website. Computer are a great tool for humans to use for business, education, and leisure. But to much is not good.
<START>

Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well @CAPS1 not this article gives you information about all of this. First, alot of people don't like computers because they say ther're to confusing. Actually computers are'nt that hard to work you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to it. Also, computers can make things easier like typing. why should you right @CAPS1 you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper. Secondly the internet is very easier then books. All you have to do is go to @ORGANIZATION1 any other search engine type what your looking for in and in a split second you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also @CAPS1 your planing a vacation the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web. Also, you can back hotels and look at live pictures with more than just . So when you back a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts. I remeber the time when I bought @MONEY1 shoes @MONEY2 online. Also it usually ships to your house in a couple of days . Lastly going on it alot isn't bad. I go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too. I can do this because at night when one one can go outside I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What @CAPS1 your mom or dad wnet on a @NUM1 weeks buisiness trip. You could use your webcam and talk to them and see than like @CAPS1 you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so @CAPS1 it is that helpful and easy to work with.

Dear newspaper company, More and more people use computers each day. But not every one agrees it benefits society. Some people say the people that are on computers dont get exercise or play outside. Then when they get off the computer their eyes hurt and they cant see as well. But will all that said I agree with the benefits of computers is very well used. The reasons why I agree with computers have benefits is that. It gives you hand-eye coordination give people info on faraway places. They can also rent hotels movies and games. You can even talk to people online from around the world! What if we didn't have computers though then what if a serious crime happend then we wouldn't be able to find the criminals name or his records! Some bad reasons for having computers is a big issue right cyberbullying! Kids might get picked. On and he will. People get called names all the time. Another big problem is online they seem freindly then they try to. There is two big problem with computers its called plagarism. Plagarism is when you take some ones work and put your name on the. It can be also be when you steal and say its yours. The second problem is stealing music getting it for free. By downloading from the internet like lime wire. Then the the song dont get the money from the albums. That is why I agree with computers give you benefits. They give you bad ones to careful when your on a computer.

Dear all computer lovers, i do think you are all spending too much time on the computer. yes, it is good to go on the computer and learn new fact, watch funny videos, and also basicly everything is on the computer these days. But most people spend to much time on the computer. you need to be doing three things, enjoy nature spending time with family and friends and most importantly, exercise. In this letter I will be explaing why you need these things, wich you cant get on the computer. First, i will be explainig why it is important to enjoy nature. Sometimes, enjoying nature can be difficult but if we all look closer it can be really fun. Some examples of nature are trees, grass, the fresh air. But I am sure all of my fellow teenagers would agree that, that is very boring we would all rather sit and watch tv. Some examples of making of making nature fun is instead of looking at a boring tree, you can climb the tree and maybe you can go outside and play with your dog and lay in the grass. One example of my favorite things to do in nature, is when I say up all night I run outside very early and lay in the grass, breathe in the fresh air and watch the sun came up. Secondly, and every importanrt that you get off the computer and spend time with family and friends. Fa mily, can do @MONTH1 things with you and I know that I am very happy when I am with family because they always make me laugh and most importantly my family loves to party. Partys are always fun ecspecially when your are with family. Freinds are also great to be with because they make you laugh have adventures and are always there for you.

Deear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a @CAPS1 thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what person are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a @CAPS1 effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. They just sit there playing games also about @PERCENT1 of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are probally pating well their on the computer which that is why some people @MONTH1 be fat. Most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @NUM1's and @NUM2's some are in there @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Just sitting there on the computer will get you. Where in life. It will not give you a job or school education. By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side. If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. Being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college, kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends you could get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours, the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eles. Well all of the kids grade through @NUM7 grade should go out a play with their toys and people @NUM8 grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like I sometimes go on facebook. Other people go on facebook, google, games looking up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is youtube and listen to music and watch veidos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people shoud be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and probally will get to fat. So the effect of computers on people is @CAPS1.

Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard over @CAPS2 @NUM1 @CAPS3 that that people believe comuters have different effects on people. To the past computers have caused problems with the human body. Amny @CAPS5 are becoming to on computers. So in my question I believe computers have a neagtiove on. First of all computers have caused @CAPS5 to not exercise and become unhealthy. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS5 have said they are their @CAPS5 are spending to each time on the computer. @CAPS5 need to realize that sitting on a computer @CAPS4 is a danger to their health you don't want you @CAPS5 to have eye problems in the do you? To the to be on the computer to much and just for work, but for playing games I realize enough I need to stop and go out and exercise to keep well-balanced health @PERSON1 says, "@CAPS4 technology increases the more and more people we have given glasses too." @CAPS5 need to make changes to what they do during the. So @CAPS4 I somputers because @CAPS5 are not become unhealthy. My people do not spend @CAPS4 much time with family and friends. In the pase my mon used to yell at me. @PERCENT1 of people believe is very important did you know that. Computers keep your divorce could have from computer. People need to within families because it decrease interaction with. My last reason is that people are not. @NUM4 ot of @NUM3 people enjoying nature you a chance to express your thought. Many people need time to think about what is happening in their life and they cannot do this our internet. TO the past stressed because I never had a to just relax and think about things I computer doing something or homework. @PERCENT2 of people who have to much going life believe that they. Do you now see that nature can be helpful? So @CAPS4 you can see computers have a negative effect because people don't get enough time to enjoy nature. To conclusion I believe computers have a huge negative effect on people. The reasons why be people would be less active, people will not interact @CAPS4 well & people enjoy nature. So I strongly you to vote being a negative effect.

Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, @CAPS1 my name is @PERSON1. I'm go to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1. I'm in @NUM1 grade. I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion if technology believe that technology have positive effect on people. My opinial is that computer are good. Keep reading to change people lifes in <@NUM2 @LOCATION1</@CAPS2>. My first reason is computer teach you hand eye coordination. For example when I was in @NUM3 grade I would go to the libary in my @ORGANIZATION1. She had a website named @CAPS3 To learn. It to help you to learn how to learn without looking at the keyboard. My second reason compute give people ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example when I was in @NUM4 grade in @CAPS4 @CAPS5 I had to write about @CAPS6. And I want on @ORGANIZATION2. I found wonderful pictures of @CAPS7. And I saw how they live. I watched a @CAPS8 specail like @NUM5 weeks ago it said @PERCENT1 of people would use @ORGANIZATION2 to look up people number and mor personal things. My third reason give people the ability to learn about faraway place and people. For example when want to talk to my cousin that live in @LOCATION3. I would go on the internet and talk to them on webcam. I clould talk to them. I read in a artice like a month ago. That @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to chart with people. In conclustion, some people might say some experts are concerned people are spending to much time and less exercing enjoying friends and family. However, being on the computer is way sdfyer than go outside. More kids or people would be salfy. Next you should post this out on you news paper.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, ect. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloose you to draw or biuld. I bet the even help young children became smarter by biulding things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad econimy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and bretheing you can find broken bones or tomors, you can biuld briges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most importen and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camra for or save a life by fing were they crased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. You can do lots of stuff with computers such as help people learn new things almost about everything. Also, there are some programs on the computer where they allow you to talk to other people. Also, for adults, they can take care of some finances and bills online and some taxes. I think computers definitely have a positive effect on people. A lot of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people. Nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new. Also, kids in school use computers all the time for school work and to learn about new things. Kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world. Computers definitely have a positive effect on people when they learn new things. Another great things about computers is that there are programs that allow you to talk to other people. Eight out of ten people talk to another person almost every day on the computer. This is a good thing because they’re able to talk to friends and family from a long distance and enjoy themselves. It is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer. Another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also. Seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer. This is a good thing because adults have to do it by hand, now they can just do it on the computer, which is definitely a positive effect on a person! I think computers definitely have a positive affect on people in many ways. They help people learn new stuff about things and. Also, they allow you to talk to friends and family over the internet. And finally, they allow you to do finances and pay the bills online instead of by hand. There are many ways still computers have a positive affect on people, I’ve only stated just a few of them. I hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive affect on people.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you keep in touch and @CAPS1 do computers effect your job? Some people are using computer to often and arent able to enjoy the outside. World. Some use computers for other things then to some times just waste time. I believe with computers having a strong a positive affect on people. You can keep in touch, you can learn, and you can have fun with computers. Computers have a big role in our society, and I know you'll have the right decision on whether or not computers are used to much. You can keep in touch. Not only can you keep in touch with relatives, but also people in different countries, or states, and even people like your friends who live next door. E-mail is a great and healthy way to communicate with others. There are also other websites like facebook and skype were you can actually post pictures up about yourself and family and be protected. @CAPS3 if you live miles and miles away you can easily show your friends the things you've been doing or your new baby boy. @CAPS4 also shows things about your personal info. You can make friends with people and plan @CAPS1 your going to hang out this weeked. Yesterday my @CAPS2 emailed me a picture of a cub bear in a tree outside of his cabin he was playing in, in for. He's over @NUM1 hours away and I can still email him back saying, "@CAPS2, did you make a friend." With in seconds he can respond saying, "I even got a bear hug =)!" @CAPS3 I talk to him while he's away and were almost together. I bet you use email as much as we do to get a of printers and. @CAPS4's a fast and easy way to communicate. You can learn.. Computers are a very big part in the learning experience. Teachers, students, parents, and grandparents learn everyday with computers. There are educational websites to learn about things. In our school yesterday on "quiz.com." @CAPS4's a website for schools were you can take quiz instead of paper. If your a busy parent, with kids, you can work online. You can get payed for the work you do with, websites, and. You can also go to school online. There are people are very busy and dont have time to go to college classes can take classes. They can learn and even interact with. The computers teach you they dont hurt you. Everything. Security, jobs, bills, school, contacting, games, everything. Most people, schools, catch their buisnesses with out a computer. Computers protects you and help you grow. You can have fun with computers. A lot of people go online and play games on numerous websites. These game can past time and the player some fun. @CAPS4 might not be running but its fun. You can do @CAPS3 many things on the computer to have fun. You can play online games, download music, skype, browse, shop,, and even meet people. Meeting people is a big thing. A lot of people these days are using. way to meet and interact with new and interesting people. My cousin is now @NUM2 and he used online dating and met this really sweet and pretty girl that lived nearby. @NUM3 years later they're maried and are more in love than imagined. See @CAPS3 love can be found out on computers and a lot of fun too. You have read my reasons and you have realized what the computer does for the world. Most everyone owns a computer and almost everyone needs one. This an easy way to communicate or keep in touch, you can learn from, and you can have fun with the computer. Many more things that are in good use. I have now convinced you that computers are very positive for people.

Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 @CAPS1 after @CAPS1. Oh, how much you want to just relax in the natural free air, but with all the advances in technology you feel it's your job to always be updated. I believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people. People aren't exercising interacting with family and friends in person, or having the ability to enjoy nature. Exercising means getting your hear to pound, your body to sweat and me because of endorprimes that ultimately make you feel better. @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all @CAPS1 does not support you with the natural urge to exercise. People who support advances in technology say, "@CAPS3 are able to teach you hand-eye coordination." @CAPS4, coordination is important but your body as a whole should also be put with account as well @PERSON1, voted # @NUM1 cardiologist in world says, "more and more people are suffering from heart disease & attacks every year!" be goes on to say, "many links have been theorized to this on going problem, But none seem to up as well as my theory. I believe peoples lives have been overcome by technology. More and more cases have samt to the people being addicted to their computers. Its unbelieveable but, @CAPS5 individuals have a @PERCENT2 higher chance of developing heart disease!! There are many healthier things you can absorp yourself in. Like tennis for example In tennis you have to develop hand-eye coordination in order to hit the ball. Correctly. Tennis also increase your heart rate & burn fat cells, to help you lose weight. Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis have actually made them more confident. This is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and head healthier , they feel they can can over the world. Isn't this the attitude everyone needs? Nature is all over and helps us are even if @CAPS4 don't notice. Like trees, they take in @NUM4) and release oxygen. Oxygen is key to life. Trees also are home to many living organisms. Like the saumel woodpecker or even owl. They all rely on trees to survive. But, if you are on the @CAPS3 @NUM5' hours a @CAPS1 @DATE1 you @MONTH1 not realize the nature and . Nature is a beautiful thing that over @PERCENT3 of peoploe say they enjoy relaxing outside, listening to birds singing morningsongs or a dear minding their own business feeding with their young watching. But, advances in technology also ruin this time belance of nature. Technology needs a power source, google, for example states to the press that," our business surely enjoys nature but needs to also run their corporation". They go on to say."we get our energy from oil and coal" @CAPS5 according, to scientists like boy say that , oil primary source for big corporations. It is for but they don't keep in mind the fact over a million each year because . And ! that deplleats me protection we get from our ozone layer. Speeding the development of climate change. "without advances in technology we @MONTH1 have a better and safer earth generations to come. Oh sure, says sue sarcastically. But since you texting her you don't know what and ask out her . If not for advances in technology people could make me right decisions. @PERCENT4 of texters say they have miss interpreted others texts. this means bad decisions all accross the world. @PERCENT1 also say have particifated in same of sexting like ther sending peictures a language. Underage children are participating in illegal activity because of advances in technology chief crimes head of the police department in @ORGANIZATION1 says that ever since the invention of the cell phone with the ability to send pictures & text he has need @NUM6 more cases on child pornography. @PERCENT5 of @CAPS5 people are under the age of without me advances of technology for cellphones this wouldn't even be possible for minors. Advances in cellular device has also kept families farmer & farmer apart. @PERCENT6 of parents sya that their children have had me some appreciation & lease that they had before they recieved cell phones. And @PERCENT1 of kids wine have cell phones say they don't think they need their family interaction anymore. Do you believe this is the message to be school to future generations? I thank you for reading this article and I hope you are now experiencing the other side of the debate children need to interact with their families more, enjoy nature and start exercising. This is impossible to do with the advances of technologe.

There are all kinds of computers, but they all do the same thing. Computers help people with anything they need. Such as, you can go online and chat with people, you can buy and sell things, you can go to college, you can learn anything, and it helps you type up your homework neatly. I personally think that computers are very helpful and we are lucky to have them. Going online can give you so many opportunities for anything. From going to college online when you don't have the time to go in person to just talking to your friends. You can learn just about anything on the computer and it's just so much fun. The computer to most people I know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones. Going to college online is so easy. There isn't alot to it. Alot of people in the country online for college. For instance, parents that want to go back but can't go in person or someone who has alot of work but cant fit in the time to actually go to college. But they can go online and take classes on their free time. Also, talking to friends online is fun too. When you arent at a friends house you can chat with them online. Maybe you can go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 or even your email. There are many ways to do it on tha fabulous computer. The computer is also jam-packed with loads of information that is helpful to anyone in the world. You can learn about different countries, people, or even the recipe of apple pic. Who knows what you can learn. The computer has things for every person in the world. Since we are all different. Some of us like to buy or sell things on the computer or do our homework. Maybe even just a fun computer game is nice. Every person in the world is different, but we have one thing in common. The world knows we need computers and computers are the smartest thing since the calculator. Buying and selling things on the computer is easier than it looks. All you have to do is put what you want to sell online or look online what you want to buy. Then you buy it or sell it. There is more to the process like the @ORGANIZATION1 people bring or take it to or away from you. But that just the basics. You can also do your homework neatly on the computer if you have a messy handwriting. Therefore, the computer has so many things that can benefit you and the world with everything it has to offer.

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1. My name is @PERSON1. I have written in response to the letter sent to me on the topic of electronics. Computers, to be percise. To me, computers are helpful, yet extremely vile. These chunks of metal are expensive, unhealthy and degrading human learning capabilities. Computers have too many negaive features for me to cope with. Dell, @ORGANIZATION1, and so many other computer companies sell computers at ridiculously expensive prices. You buy one on sale and when you need your computer, @CAPS2!, malfunctions and problems assalt you. Now you have to call a repair man who will charge you even more money! Did you really spend your hard earned cash on a faulty hunk of trash? This is ridiculous. I went onto my computer yesterday and what do you think happened? It crashed! My six hundred dollar computer crashed! Computers are too expensive to have to keep. When I get rid of mine, I'm not getting another. Have you ever sat at your computer so long your eyes watered? Horrible to endure, that's not the only problem your computer can cause. Your health is at stake! When you sit at your computer working or playing instead of going out for a jog or exercise, your health degrades. Gaining weight, pink eye from staring at the screen, do I have to go on!? The very computer you @MONTH1 love can harm you. I say, get rid of that computer. Visit friends, family and aquaintances. Be active and stay healthy. Not for me, but for you. The next point I am about to say @MONTH1 shock, surprise, or scare you. Your computer is making you stupid. I can't say it nicely. Don't call me rude because it's true. I'll give you an example. A student receives a classic home work assignment. Define these three or four words. Easy right? Wrong, I'm afraid @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids surveyed go home and use computers to retrieve the answers to homework. What if your child is cheating? What will happen to then? They could drop out of school early and live their lives as people who can't learn for themselves. Is that the world we want for kids? No! We should destroy the computers. Thank you for reading my paper. It was a pleasure as always to write to you. Have a nice day.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers are bad because you will be wonign to do no homework because people are playing to much computers and they are getting aditivf to the computers and it is dayise because you mit be talking to people that you don't now on thr computer and it is the vary dagis because it is the sam thing as haveing a myspace on teh computer it is vaery dangish because ther are dad people that be going on the computer and people be pating bad stuf on the computer.

I do not agree that computers benefits society. There are threes big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and arent spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people arent getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day. People would gain weight might ever get dabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten tov used to all the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk, with friends. People should al least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. So this is why I think this is bad for the societys benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart. Thank you!

Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. My neibor, who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. So I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad.That is why computers have a negative effect on our society.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 the world has changed so much, for the better. Technology has become so advanced, there are new cures for for different diseases. Computers are one of these great benefits. They let you communicate quicker. You can keep up with family members and old friends. You can also talk to different people who live in another state, country, or continent. These a quote that says "communication is key." I'll put that into more details in my next paragraph. I remember one time long ago, the only way to communicate was by letters or you would have to walk. Now wih computers with just one email or an instant message. Someone can get your messgae in. By sending a letter it can take a while. Even if you and call some one they @MONTH1 not be home or answer. But you can get emails and instant message ways. It also doesn't cost to send long distnace. Which will be bring yo my next topic. A profressor at @ORGANIZATION2 once said "Computers are taking time " But, if you think about it what it's actually doing is reconnecting with family members and old friends. For example, you @MONTH1 move and not be able to see them again. Then, you get a new phone number and forget other people number. If you have a computer you go on this great social networking side called where you look up some old friends name and distant realtives and you find out that it's really them. Than they you to other family members and before you know it you all to other again. Now, I'll bring to you my @DATE1 topic. The world wide web is a big place were peolple from all over the. On the world wide web you can meet some new people who not live in your state, or country. But, you find that you are starting to click when you meet this person they @MONTH1 be of a different rare. Thats ok you can learn new thing about a different cuture. While you two @MONTH1 have something in common you can share other things you like to do which you can try, so you're learning something new while having fun at the same time. Now you'll see it's time you get a computer rather than never have the experience. With a computer you can communcate quicker. You can reconnect with distant relatives and old friends. You can also talk to different people who like you.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you dont even need a keyboard. Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. We'll computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the vireses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parcore. Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They to, might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a buisness that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more.If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us suesede is great.

Dear readers, On the current debate of the effects of computers, I believe they strongly benefit all people. For example on some computers a business software can be incorporated, allowing a meeting to be help over the computers. Not only is it convienent, but this saves money. Also, computers come with built in programs that can help keep track of you expenses. These are simple and save lots of time. Plus, computers also help you stay in touch with friends. Even if they are @NUM1 miles away you can click a button and have a live video chat! First off, the business software on new computers are out of this world. You can make a brochure of sales and expenses, all with an easy stroke on the mouse. This is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer you and all you clients can hold a conference call. Doing this allows you to relax and multitask while your computer is feeding you coverage of the call in crystal-clear sound. Normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free. Another time where computers are handy is at tax time. Tired of running around your house to find you car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1, taxes can be calculated in along with their name, so when you take the taxes to tax consultant, everything is organized. Using these tools cut down an stress and leaves you less frustrated. And even better, you can buy a tax program for you computer, so you never have to leave your couch! Think about, paying somebody to count your taxes year after year, when you can save a fortune and do it yourself. Above all, computers help you connect with old friends who have moved away or parted ways earlier in life. Now, the internet contains many social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 where you can reunite with lost pals. These networks also offering access to photosharing and chat, so everybody can see how your family is and vice versa. Along with this is video chatting, where you can have face to face conversation with somebody even on the other side of the world. This is totally private, so it isn't dangerous to say names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an amazing tool! To conclude, the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives. Not only can we see who man the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also has interactive business softwares as well. Never again will work be so difficult. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you on top of your game. Finally, it is also helpful for all the tools that can be used to interact with friends thousands of miles away. I believe the computer is critical for success and happiness in life. It's a new age, let's adapt to it.
<START>

To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 your life without a laptop or a desktop computer. It would be hectic right? How will you keep up with your email or type of the articles for this very newspaper? Even though some people @MONTH1 believe that computers are taking away from exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends, computers do have a positive effect on us. The list of reasons why is endless but three that stand out are you can communicate with people in other states or countries, it's more interesting to learn from a website than a textbook, and eventually @CAPS2 will be computerized anyway. Am I right? Have your old teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country? If yes, didn't you have to, write letters? Then, you had to wait at least @NUM1 weeks before your pen pal wrote back. If you had used computers, you would've gotten a response back within days. I know many parents and other adults @MONTH1 think that e-mails are a waste of energy but actually they're faster than letters will ever be. Has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring? Yes? No? That's where computers come in. It's much more interesting to use the internet than reading from a book. I understand that some students can read from a book and retain all of the facts that they've learned from that one book but various students learn differently than that. If a student learns from the internet, they're more likely to remember it because they won't be put to sleep by the boredom of a textbook. Many people have mentioned and some statistics show that by at least @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be computerized. Do you seriously want to be the last one left behind? I wouldn't I understand that you are a person who likes to keep up with the current events so why not use your computer more often? When they say @CAPS2, they mean @CAPS2. They even have @CAPS3 tools on computer. So I want you to take a survey of how many people find computers effective and you'll be surprised. Many people will say the same that I've said. The choice is yours, which side are you on? Thank you.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in the @NUM1 grade in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 In @LOCATION1. I'm writing to you because I heard that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In @CAPS1 opinion I think it benfit society. If you keep reading I will fell why it benif society. @CAPS1 first reason that computer have a positive effect on people. For example, when I see @CAPS1 older brother go on the computer he look much smarter on it. That @NUM2 out of @NUM3 member of @CAPS1 family learn thing from the computer. @CAPS1 second reason that it teach hand eye coordination. For example, when I play games in the computer @CAPS1 hand are the ones doing every thing for me. (@PERSON1 example is that we I wacth the game @CAPS1 hand are roating) @CAPS7 @NUM4 of @NUM3 of human play games in the computer and let their hand do everything. @CAPS1 third reason that it give people the ability to learn. For example, when I was using the computer use too teach so much that I'm go on most of the time. @NUM6 of @NUM3 student study in computers and they learn about thing that they never knew. Also they have the ability learn more on the computer. Some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer. However, I said that computer help people learn about thing that happen in the word. For example, they could larn about the war that going on and how people are risking their life for this cause. In conclusion, In @CAPS1 opinion it benefit society. Computer have a positive effet, I theach hand eye, and it give people the ability to learn. I think you should put all you support in the problem.

Have you ever had someone move away and you wanted to keep in touch? Well having a computer allows this to happen. @CAPS4, it gives students the to learn different places. People and much more. But why do some people not hire them? First computers allow you to talk online with friends and family. For example using email, @CAPS1 and video chat for example I have a friend who moved away and now we email back and forth to keep in touch. @CAPS1 allows people to chat instintly and upload pictures and videos. For examples my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 pictures of my baby cousins so people can see how their growing up. Lastly, some buessnesses use a webcam to talk to other people. Say the boss on a the but to see how he employees were doing withness him he could hook up a web cam and have a conversation with them. That is how computers allow people to the @CAPS4, computers @CAPS4 people to learn about things, for example if a student rod to make a topic they could type the topic a website like bring or google and they could find all the answers they needed to help them with their project. @CAPS4 if a family wanted to go on to see they could search for it and find a hotell and sites they might want to see that is how computer allows people so that the reader can read their hand writing. @CAPS4 they help pay taxes. For example, turbo tax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and it remembers every tax you have paid. So if some company sends you a notice saying you havent payed a bill you can go on turbo tax and check. So reader these are some ways why people should enjoy computers. They allow people to talk to friends and family by email, @CAPS1, and @CAPS4 by webcam. They @CAPS4 give people the ability to learn information faraway places and people. Lastly what is so bad about having a computer? They allow people to pay taxes online and @CAPS4 type papers. Computers are needed in this day and age or else some people would not be able to survive without them. So reader these are some reasons why people should easily computers.

Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that more people should start using computers. They can offer things that just writing things down or a pece of paper cant, like being able to learn about things that aren't taught in school, you can talk with friends online and you can keep everything in one. The first reason I think more people should use computers is that they can learn about things that arent taught in. Such as current events, the history of our nation and how our government works. Now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on @CAPS1 or a newspaper. But the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video. Also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on @CAPS1. Another reason I think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet. This is great because there @MONTH1 be people you havent seen in awhile because they moved. I had a friend who moved to pitsburg when I was @NUM1 and when I got u @CAPS3 account I was able to find him and talk with him a while of him visiting. Or you can just keep in touch with friends that so to a different school. The last reason I think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures, videos, document and contacts on your hard time. This is important to because I am not very well organized when it comes to school. But I started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer. This helped me be less clutteres and keep all my work in our place. It also means you can email that walk to a teacher or notes a friend who might have missed school that day. So in conclusion that or why I think we should have peple we computers more. They can help you learn, let you talk with friends, or let you keep everything in one place. That is why I think more people should use computers.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Thanks to computers people arn’t being active as much, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. One reason this is true is because people are not exercising, they're too busy playing on the computers. People are gaining weight, which is already a problem in the @LOCATION1 because of unnecissary technology. There are plenty of sports that could be done, such as soccer, baseball, football, and so many more. People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them. Another reason computers don't have a positive effect on people is because they don't go out and enjoy nature. People spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park, even by the beach and you'll see loads of animals. Not to mention, the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home! No computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often. Thirdly, a reason why computers arn't positive on people is because they're not interacting with other people. Some people are too busy on facebook or myspace, e-mailing or @CAPS3-ing each other. Sometimes they arn't even talking to who they believed they were, it not only dangerous but unhealthy also. Whats wrong with giving someone far away a call? You can actually hear their voice and know its them on the other line! Its rediculous how people will e-mail a friend thats down the street. It would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house. The two of you can chat and take a walk, or play a game, not just sit infront of a screen the whole day. Computers make interacting with other people, in person, a lot more difficult. With computers people are not active enough, don't enjoy nature often, or interact with others as much. They simply are not a positive effect on people. You should also agree and let computers stay to perfessionals.
<START>

Dear editors, I was planning on taking a trip to @LOCATION1. I found directions within a second using a computer. Computers are great, people friendly pieces of equipment, but as technology evolves, people are beginning to rely on their computers for entertainment. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, but there are many outdoor activities that are more healthy then sitting around on the computer all day such as socializing, the great-outdoors, and other on sports. Familiar with @CAPS1 is a great program for socializing but there are many stronger dangers. Did you know that anybody can view your profile which contains personal info? You don't always have to chat online. Call up a friend and hang out at maybe a local movie theatre. Many people, and I agree, think seeing a movie with their pals is alot more entertaining then playing online chess or any other virtual game with a friend a fan of movies? No problem! go on a walk or a bike ride or walk your dog while riding a bike! There are so many. @ORGANIZATION1 park. What an amazing place to spend your vacation camp outs at @TIME1, bikes during the day, its a wonderful part of nature and the best part of you a park anywhere in the world! Camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends. Hiking is a popular part of a parks and can be performed by all ages, so go out and spend a weekend in the great outdoors! Not looking at a computer screen. Soccer, baseball, basketball and lacrosse. These are just come of the many fun sports. Out there, and yes, they are certainly fun and healthy. Every town I know about has sport fields where many kids and adults of all ages use. it also a great way to make friends! Get to know them in person and not over the internet. Daily exercise while having fun beats just having fun on a computer. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this article and go out and meet new friends. Visit a local park or play a sport for fun. If I were to name everything to do other than use a computer, it wouldn't fit in this entire newspaper. So go explore!
<START>

Guess what! Do you like to use computers well I do and I think it benfits society for a couple of reasons. It is good to use to get information on things, to meet people and just to expose the internet and if you keep on reading @CAPS1 ill tell you why think that. One reason I think it benfits society because how in this lifetime you need to know what is going on in the world. So instead of you always watching the news or reading newspaper. You could go on the internet and see what is going on from the internet. Thats why I think it benfits society today. A second reason is haveing a computers poeple get to talk over the web and meet new poeple. Being able to talk online to people like faimly and your friends. That you havent seen or heard from in a long time. And you don't have thier number you will tot alk to them during they are on the internet. A third reason is haveing a computer and is always on it. You can explore the internet and get facts on poeple, things, and places that you never knew about and from you going on the internet you learn more things that tou never knew before. A fourth reason is by haveing a computer you can go to school on the internet. And you dont have to leave your house because you can go to school from there and by doing that most poeple could stay out of trouble because there not leavinf there house. Unfortunally I ahve to end this letter but has mush reasons and details I gave ou on why I think haveing a computer is a good idea. You will agree with me and why I think that.
<START>

In my opinion i think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow you to communicate will people from anywhere in the world. You can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book. Also many more jobs want people with computer skills. It is also fun and educational. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, lets say @LOCATION1. It would be a lot harder, dont you think? Well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer. Many teachers enjoy doing activities with penpals. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. Also, if you were looking for specific information about florida it is alot easier on a computer. You just type in what it is you are looking for, rather than reading through tons of books, in which case you might not even find what you are looking for. Also the computer has millions of iinformation. The computer also has various pictures which is also good. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper. For example make animated movies and video games. These things have evolved over the years thanks to computers. Finally my last reason, its not only educational its also fun. Sure you can research information and do you rhomework on the computer, but you can also play games. Computers can do all sorts of different things. Computers can be programed to have simulations for jobs like policemen ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers our country probably wouldn't be as evolved as it is today.

People use computers everyday. There's so many reasons way the're always on. They could be talking to one of their family relatives. Also they're probally looking for jobs. There's many things and people shouldn't tell them what to do with their lives. Many people in @LOCATION1 use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things. Also they could be talking to one of their family relatives. There's a thing called webcam and people in @LOCATION1 use it so they could see one another. Buisnesses people are always on the computer because they need to print out documents and they probally got to send something to another country. Buisnesses people also do lots of work on the computer. They can still exercise in @TIME1 for a quick jog, but also thats their choice if they want to stay health or not, plus they're busy people. Other hand people who go on the computer and who are not buisness people or they're not talking to family member or an old friend are students and parents. Tons of students in @LOCATION1 have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information. Parents on the other hand also help out their children and they also talk to their relatives or these looking for a new home or job. If all those people are busy let them do their work they want for need to do. Once their done they could excerise but if they don't want to and other people told them to go not take a walk or anything healthy then it's their lost. We can't some them too. They're just getting better everyday and it's not effecting us. its effecting them. If they want to be on the computer they're also getting bad eye-sight because of too much light.

Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like "@CAPS8" and "@CAPS9". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say @CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly "daunting" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11. PC and start seeing @ORGANIZATION2 Nature! She's beautiful!

Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a coolest effect on people. It allows people to develop hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about faraway people and cultures, and communicate online through e-mail or instant messaging. All of these reasons prove to be a positive reason to use the computer. You will need computer skills in various jobs and what better to start than now. Hand-eye coordination is a and in life. You need the in jobs, and in to days @CAPS1 the for that gets In the quarter mile must be able to find his and on in an office you have to watch as typing. you to watch popular with today. @CAPS6, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are only a few of many websites were people can communicate through instant messaging or e-mail. All of these sites allow you to find family members, friends, and many more. You can in with a friend that is out of state, or you can talk with a person out of this country! Many people do this in their spare time to try and set up a reunion with people that you know in middle school through college. Tons of these people have not seen were @NUM1. So as you can see contacting people through internet is by many people in our world today. So as you can see I support the use of computers, and I feel they are critical to peoples daily lives. Whether they are building hand-eye coordination, researching a country, or contacting family and friends through @CAPS3, @CAPS2, @CAPS6 the internet is highly valued and I hope you feel the same way.

The computer is a great achivement of man. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other capabilities. Even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world. It has negatively afect to people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Along with that they are being socialy active. The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people. It would be great if some how the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should wont to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just dont let computers control your life.

Have you ever had a computer? I'm sure if you was around my age you know how fun it is to explore the internet. It's a brain tht gives you information about everything. But, it’s not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer. Things like exercise, socializing and homework matter. If you don't exercise you begin to gain weight, if you don't socialize you'll be an lonely person. Homework is the most important, because it'll help you really well through life. It's fine to go on the computer time to time, but not for hours. Exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports, you should jog a couple times of day. Some people make you feel bad if your bigger than they are. For example, I knew someone who was a little big for his age, but people didn't like him and they always made fun of him. I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer. Do you have ant friends? Or did all of them leave you because you wouldn't stop surfinh the web on your computer. As a teenager you should be socializing with your friend at the movies, arcaded and parties. Not in the house on the computer. Especially with your family, because you never know if they're going shopping for you ask me that's selfishness. Every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades? Education is the most important thing you need in your life. Without it you can't be or do anthing, because you wouldn't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job how can you pay for electrity bill for your computer? Education can get anywhere, if you want it. If not you can be a homeless guy in the street holding a computer that doesn't work. Do you still think this has a positive effect on people? You should talk to parents about getting their child an computer. For example, tell the parent to put a password that only she/he knows, that way he has to ask you to sign onto it everytime we needs it. Blocks off things that you think is important for your child., especially if your child is into sex. That is why I don't think it gives people the right kind effect they might need.

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chating on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative, so in aim a problem I still have yet to find out. I asked question like "what do you do at home?", "are you a computer geek?". (@CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a comcast commercial) and some who don't know what a computer is (not commenting). I am here to teach about the benifits of exercising and not the un natural ways of a computer. Did you know people can loose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse dont believe me try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get , give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick for example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorsed the depression effected his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1 @CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infecte and could have ended his life. I believe this was from lacks of communication and this happens everyday to everyone just open your eyes and relise what a computer can do to a man or woman. (@CAPS5 was remaried to bonnie and now carrys a scars on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many, do people spend to much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neibor see what they think. I relly hope you consider my argument.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, some people do spend most of the day on the computers, but not everyone. Oh, let me start with no. Not all people take atvantege of the computer. Like scientest, your banks, and schools. These tipe of computers helps us through life. With out these computers then we willl still be cluless on a lot of things. But, there are people out there that did take atvantege of the computers. And they still do. With unforgiving acks like child porn. One of our mane problem in the world is child porn. And a lot has to do with the kidnapping. Or in rare cases the parents are the cause of it. So these are a lot of changes that need to be doen. But when there cleared then the computer world will be peacful once agaen.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that experts are saying people are spending to much time on computers didn't agree. Im writing to you today to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people with their time usage, what they are doing , and computer dead. If you will please continue on I would like to share with you my thoughts. Computers today are consuming our world. People are spending way to much time on the computer. I believe they should set a timer on how long they are on the computer. Lets say they set a @NUM1 hour limit then once its up they have to get off. I think this would help because if were spending to much time inside were not gonna be able to get enough exercise, which isn't good for our health. Please continue on to learn about how we should use the computer. Parents have to set a good example for kids. If parents use the computer @NUM2 then their child will think it's ok to do so. If the child then starts spending all their time on the computer then they won't be spending anytime with their friends. Kids today need to spend more time outside then playing games on the computer. Also the parents and child need to spend time together, if they are both on the computer they cant spend time together. Please read on about how we will go computer dead. Computer dead is a term I call when all we want to do is use the computer. We need to be healthy about our computer usage. If we aren't then we could start to get withdrawls from the computer and then will spend more time on the computer. If you go computer dead then it will slowly start to take over our lives. I think if this does happen it will be hard to get over an stop using the computer. Please read on to finish reading my letter. Thank for reading about how we need to mange our time issues, how we use the computer and computer dead. I hope you will consider my thoughts. Thank you again for your time spent reading this.

Dear editor I agree that people do spend to much time on their computers. An if you read this you would see my reasons why. One of them will be about exercising. The two others will be about your friends and family. So read my reasons and by the end I hope I made my point. All right like I said first we will talk about what the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer. Did you know that from being on the computer all the time you lose focus on exercising anymore? Of you eating an @CAPS1 not exercising, because your worried about the computer. The weight that you put on you know just doesn't burn off by themselves. So by you not burning off that fat you just keep gaining and gaining. By the time you know it you'll be over weigh and wish you didn't spend all that time on that computer. How that I'm explaining about your of exercise. Where going to talk about your you bring on the computer all you would with your family. For example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer @CAPS1 parents would @CAPS1 they would because your lack of communication with the family. I've got my two reasons across let me get my third. Of you bing on that computer you have been adicted, but you just don't lose contact with family, but also with friends. You loving that computer so much you probably quite all your like the basketball, softball, and more teams because you thought it took to much of your computer time. In the end you would lose probably alot of frienships. @CAPS1 your boyfriend or girlfriend would dump you. So now that you read this I hope I got my point out to you, about what a computer can do to you in the end.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing you this letter to inform you that computers do benefit society. Computers benefit society because we can learn about places we want to go. It also benefits society because in a couple years everything will be computers. However, computers benefit society because they @MONTH1 life easier now a days. My opinion is that computers do benefit society. Computers help everyone a lot. First, we can learn about the places we want to go to. We want to learn about the places so we can travel there. However, when we know a lot about that place we might want to but our plane tickets threw the computer site then after you get the plane tickets you can go and discover the places/place. Second, in a couple years everything will be computers. However, @CAPS3 will be threw a computer site (world wide web). We will get our education online. There will be games online. Computers do benefit society. Lastly, computers make life easier. They make life easier because instead of picking up a phone to call your friends or family you can go online to talk, they also make life easier beacuse instead of going to your family or friends house you can go on to aim or what ever chat site you got and chat threw instant messaging. In conclusion, computers do benefit society. First, you can learn about places you want to go to. Second, everything will be threw computers in a couple years. Lastly, computers make life easier.

Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people not great but its good for many reasons, for now I have three reason why its good, my reasons are, search new places meet new people, when people have nothing to do, and teenagers that cant be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they dont have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they dont have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also thre are many websites of movies. My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer. teenagers are teenagers they must have technology. If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop. This is my opion on the effects computers have on people.
<START>

Computers benefit society, people can socialize online with anyone. You can use the internet to communicate with people all over the world. I talk with my pen pal from @LOCATION2 almost all the time with vidio char, the most popular websites today are social. For example facebook, myspace, and twitter, thease days @PERCENT1 of people have an account on at least one of thease websites and that number grows everyday. @CAPS1 live has made vidio games a lot more social. @NUM1 in @NUM2 kids are playing with a friend they know while playing @CAPS1. By useing computers your hand eye coordination will increase significant key hand eye coordination is used in a lot of sports. "I don't know if I'd be @CAPS2 good of a tennis player without useing a computer to boost my hand eye coordination. "@PERSON1 you can use hand eye coordination to do stuf faster. I can copy notes so much faster because I can write and look at the bord at the same time. Wheather you relize it or not hand eye coordination is very inportent computers can improve hand eye coordination by @PERCENT2. People can use computers to learn online. When you go on the internet you can learn about cool places and plan vacations. For @DATE1 break me and my dad used the internet to learn about @LOCATION1 we then decided to go there and bought tickets. You can learn about interesting people in history. There are over ten billion articals about famouse people in history. On the internet you can also learn new resipys if you are a cook. "@CAPS2 an @ORGANIZATION1 I learned most of my cooking online." - @ORGANIZATION1. Online you can also learn how to improve your technice in sports. Before I joined the swim team I looked up on the internet how to improve your swim technice and how I qualifyed to go to @CAPS3 with my team because the internet inproved my time by two seconds wich was enough for me to go. I belive the computer is an amazing invention that has tremendosely inpacked socioty.
<START>

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think, in my opinion, that computers benefit to society greatly. The reasons I believe this is because of @NUM1 main reasons: Computers are a limitless source of knowledge, there are websites with online communities and it's just plain fun to use. Computers, as we all know, are a limitless source of knowledge. Now then, as you know adults need to work A @CAPS2 so most of the time if someone has to research something for work they could use a computer. Even kids who go to school need to use the internet of the computer for something like a project or homework. Now I know everyone, kids and teens especially, love to talk to their friends so most people sign up for an online community website. Now I'm very aware of online pedophiles but that can be taken care of by the fact of having friends you know of in real life to sign up as well. Lastly, I have to say computers are just fun to use. Kids like me that normally have a long rough day at school like to come home and rest with some nice game on the computer. Now this sounds like it just lazy but it is something nice to do for a distraction to other things. And thats where I stand on terms of the endless knowledge, online communities, and just plain fun of the computer.
<START>

Do Computers benfit the society? Yes, computers benefit the society. Computers give kids so much knowledge about things they would not be able to do or go in real life. Another thing is computers give kids a positive ego or entertainment. Also computers let other kids interact with each other like facebook, or @CAPS1. There are many good details why computers are good for the society. First, when most kids dont know an answer to question they can go on google to fing the answer. Which helps in most cases. Also when on google, or any "@CAPS2 @CAPS3" it gives kids the chance to @CAPS2 anything and most likly get arreasonable answer. Kids can @CAPS2 up facts about other countries, famous people, and even types of pets! Another benefit of having computers is most kids on the internet go to have fun or entertain themselves, which could lead to a positive ego or better self-convidence. Just because kids arent going outside to have fun, doesnt mean they cant have fun inside either. Third, parents or any gauriden always talk about there kids or would like to see them with friends. Well having thing such as facebook and @CAPS1 or @CAPS5 you can make new friend around the town or even other @CAPS6. The internet can do all of those things. Finally do computers benefits society? Yes computers do benefits society, they can give you alot of knowledge, make new friends and to just let kids be kids. As you can see computers do benefit the society.

Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have and use computers everyday. Computers are killing us as a nation. We need to put a stop to this abuse of computers. Millions of parents and kids spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer. They are either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 games and other types of games out on the internet. Kids use these as entertainment. But having an @NUM2 year old child playing a game with guns is certainly unnacceptable. Kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they don't even think of playing sports or going outside. Therefore, the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air. This can lead to obesity or other weight issues. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, so why keep these horrid games out there? The last thing @LOCATION1 needs is more kids becoming fat!! There are two ways to use a computer for good and for bad ways to use them for good can be for planning a vacation, or working at a job, or even to look at a child's grades online. But many kids and parents don't use computers for these reasons. Kids have been caught looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking into systems and other criminal type things. The computer is a way to do things that you shouldn't, while keeping your identity hidden. For example, whever I sign-up for a website subscription so I can play a game, it asks me for personal information. It askes for my name, my address, my phone number and other things. So what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info. So a computer hacker or a fraud site can't steal my personal info. And who are we to know that people don't do this with illegal programs? Computers are dangerous to @LOCATION1's well-being. On top of obesity, there have been reported cases of a child or parent having a seizure, having the picture of a game implanted in their eyes because they don't take their eyes of the game. There has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his/her parents in rage. Computers turn kids and parents into wild beasts. Parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games. In some cases, the parent destroys an account on a website or takes a computer away for a certain ammount of time. These actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane! Cases have been reported of smashing computers, doing bad in school, killing parents as I said earlier and in some cases suicide. So in conclusion, computers are a source of health issues, action issues and mental issues. If we want @LOCATION1 to be restored to the @LOCATION1 we all love, then we the people, must put a stop to this computer addiction!

Dear @CAPS1, In a recent poll it was determined that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come in contact with computers. @PERCENT2 of those said @CAPS2 use computers daily, and not just for work. This extensive use of technology creates a lack in their exercising habits, @CAPS4, they enjoy nature much less. Furthermore, people spend less time interacting with family and friends. These are demaging effects on our society. "The biggest reason why people dont exercise, " says health proffessor @PERSON1, "is because they just don't have time." This problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. You can argue that they @MONTH1 be learning new things or broadening their horizons. However, none or which help these people get or stay healthy and in shape. Being on the computer does no good for the body. Click the next link and watch as a beautiful humming bird swarms across the screen of your desktop. You can clearly see its wonder, but can you feel it? Can you smell the fresh air it flies around? The computer can only show you nature, but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand. Society will only cheat itself of the world's splendor while watching it on screen. Fans of computers will argue that they help you interact with people around the world, but what about the people in the next room? Computers @MONTH1 bring you to people globally, but distance you from people at your job, school or home. As humans, they need contact with the outside world. Why limit themselves to typing to people, when they can talk to them? In conclusion, extensive computer use does not benefit society. People will spend less time staying active. More over, people will enjoy nature on a desktop instead of in person. Finally, society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person. The time has come to take a stance. It should be clear that computers are a danger to society.

I think that the advances of technology to the computer are great and more beneficial than bad. Say you struggle at school and need serious help, you can turn to a computer for help, say you have a dear friends that a week ago moved to florida, you can use the computer to contact them. And finally if you want to learn about the world, great! Google search places to learn about. These are just a few reasons why the computer is helpful as opposed to bad! School one of many students least favorite activities, yet you can use the internet to help you out, @CAPS1! say you are in geometry and it is kicking you're butt, got to @PERSON1 academy for informational videos. Maybe you are a third grade teacher and the little kids are driving you nuts, go to @LOCATION1, and educational and fun website. Maybe you just want to relax and learn, plug in earphones and listen to math help. These are merely a few ways that the internet helps with schooling. What if it is a really rainy rainy day and you are tired and want to learn about faraway places in a logical person's head, the internet pops into their head. Think of the computer as a big easy to acess library, type something into a search engine and it pops up. What if you are in germany and you are hungry, oh no! Everything is in @CAPS2! open your laptop for easy translation. All of these things support that the internet makes learning about foreign places easy. And finally, communication is really easy, with the internet because, there use emails, skypes, chatrooms etc. internet's middle name is communication. What if your phone is gone and there is an emergency, you can get the email! What if a burgalor cuts the phone lines and sneaking your house e-mail @NUM1. And finally internet can be used to call @PERSON2 and tell him, "don't forget the red bull" as he leaves. Those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication. Go let's recap on this paper. Internet is great for communication. Also help with learning about far away places. And finally help with schooling. These are the reasons I think internet is valuable in this day in age.

The effects that i have on computers are good. I will be talkin about things that help the human nature with one technology computers. How people can learn about faraway palces. Helps them with school, and taxes. How to communicate with people that arnt with you. and my conclusion with all three reasons. The effects of computers on me are very good. Because they help people learn about faraway places. Lets say a family is planning a vocation to @LOCATION1. And they dont no anthing about it so they go on a computer and they could book a reserucition for a hotel. My second opinion on computer is that. you have a project for school and you need the right information. Thats not in books go on a computer. Lets say you have to do taxes online because your cripplede (@CAPS1) so you might wanna @NUM1 www. turbotax.com. and you hale your taxes infront of your eyes. My hold opinion on computers is. @NUM2 you have a friend or family member you lost contact with. Go on the computer and find them and then you guyz can plan a day were you guyz could catch up/ @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 guardians have issues about there child. They can confront the situation about three child. and last ley my last conclusion. Thats what i feel about computer. That we need them to communicate to other people. To do assignments for a job or school. Or to learn about places that you never been to before or would like to vacation to. And the reason why i feel like that is because i passion for computer. And i hope you like what i wrote. I hope i persuaded you to like computers more.

Dear newspaper, Have you ever grabbed a nice cold cake and sat at your computer desk? I @CAPS1 I have computers do benefit society. One way computers benefit society is it doesn't make people stand arcuna a book store or libray hours at a time. Another way computers benefit society is by letting people chat with people all over the over world. The last way that computers benefit society is it teaches people handeye coordination. If you have ever been to a bookstore or library you @CAPS1 how hard it is to find the book your looking for. Instead of spending hours on your feet @CAPS2 go sit on your computer for ten minuets or less. On the computer you can get any information about any information about anywhere or anything. one book about @LOCATION1! Going to the library Have Experts say the it helps people has done many tests and the people that use computers have better hand eye coordination than people that dont use computers. Dr a health magazine that the people that dont use computers arent very. Being able to @CAPS2 a skill it helps your mind to. As you can see computer benefit society helps peoples hand eye coordination.
<START>

To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need.
<START>

I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today.

The effect people shouldn't be on the computers that much because you need exercising to keep you healthy. You wouldn't be learn anything if you play games on it all day. Your brain will be fousing on the computers than school. You would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this. It will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers. The effect on people on the computer by not knowing technology is some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain instead of a computers have information in your brain if you are smart. Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard technology and country some of them don't even have technology or electrion because they can't afford for a computers. The effect that they don't know technology is they can find location and no cellphone you can call your friend go online and listen to music, play games chat to friend and family. Play games with each other. And watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on. Click on intert explorer and search on a website to go on it's kind of hard to use the keyboard and typing it fast. The last effect is talking to people that you don't know form online. Is playing the game with a diffrent player you can chat with that person. Conulison this is all my reason why I agree with the effect of a computer have postive reason for a lot of people. This is why I agree with the effect of the computer.
<START>

Personally I think computers have a good influence on people. There one of the greatest inventions.With computers you can listen to music or watch @CAPS1, research things for your projects, or just have a good time. Computers help people create, listen to, watch and make music and @CAPS1. When you have a computer you can get influenced by other musicians to create music. And where does eating that music need to go? Into a computer to add beats and different vocals. You can also watch @CAPS1 on there! Not exactly @CAPS1 but whatever show you'd like to see. Some people even create movies on special programs. Thats not all though. Alot of questions can be answered on the computer by doing research. Cures for different disease like cancer can be found. Even small research projects like "Who founded @CAPS2" can easily be found with one quick google search. Yeah we might be getting lazy but it makes peoples lives simpler. For instance intead of reading through dozens of books you could just search it on the internet for the answers. You can even take classes online not impressed? Another great effect of people on computers is socializing and having fun. Socializing over computers @MONTH1 not be as effective as socializing in person but it gives the quieter people. like me , a chance to say whats on their mind. Plus there wont be any of those akward silence moments like there usually seems to be on the phone. Oh, did I mention facebook. On how I love facebook. I get to keep in touch with my family and friends I no longer see. I used to have a very close friends, but after we switched schools I never heard from her. Until I found her on facebook. Same with many other people. And for the younger ones they'll be bored with the billions of games online. How could you go wrong? Sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people. But what do you guys think. Can one big negative out weigh a ton of positve? I think not.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 of my local news paper: @CAPS2 you believe this garbage that the so called expert are saying about computers? I sure hope you don't! They are saying that computers are health risks because to many people are on them and not exercising, well if you risk me the users should know when to stop. And well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits. Also computers are very convient, if you need information on a topic right away. So there far I think computers are not the one's at, in this perdevment. Exercising is somthing a perosn should have the ambition to do. @MONTH1 people don't have this they spend their day on the computer. they claim its not their faut. the computer is a you to play it. I read just last week that someone actolly told her press they it is not fault her over weight. Thats ! So the only person at full. for not getting the the gamer. As us family interaction goes, all up to the parents the use the parents are in control over they child and if they are that their kid doesn't spend enough time. The operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits!. If we didn't have computers at home it would be a. Kids relie on computer them quick, accurate information. With not them the parents should their child to and from the library, and the time. And lets not forget the internet easy. So in conclusion computers are the way to go they are not the cause or however luck of exrcising at fault. Its not the computers fault familys. And they are just so convenit so clearly computer are good to have! I truly hope by the letter you agree with my oppinion.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors.

Dear local news papers, I'm writing to tell you that people on the computer is not a bad thing. Would you enjoy being bord? Or to enter tained while learning something? Being on the computer helps with hand eye coordination, you can learn about amazing places, and even talk friends. Hand eye cordination is good because it good. Save millions of people in war for example my grandpa went into the @ORGANIZATION1 and @NUM1 people were firing at him but he had good hand eye cordination from the computer go it saved his life less people will get hurt like getting your hand gramed in the car door. There would be more to do. The more something just as important as hand eye cordination is learning! On the internet you can learn about anything and everything. if you learn about far away places you will be able to widen your conversation people will think your smarter and you'll feel good, not only what other people think you sin truelly get smarter. Most importantly you can talk to friends! If you are taking so your friends it can build up your self asteam and when you go to school you'll social did you know @PERCENT1 of people do better in school if they comunicate online? Don't you wish every day you could be proud of your self? Well talking online helps! This is why im writing to you to share all my ideas and concerns. I hope you concider them and share them with the rest of the world.
<START>

Imagine our beautiful town filled with unhealthy, lazy, noninteracting and addicted people. The issue to grapple with is should you the local people, spend more time on computers or not, I believe @PERCENT1 that we should not spend all of our time on computers. It can ruin your eye sight, you don't enjoy nature while interacting with people, and most importantly it make you very unhealthy. Can you picture @CAPS1 person in your town blind and having glasses or even going to the @CAPS1 @DATE1? Just ask eye @PERSON1," @CAPS1 year I get and more people coming to the eye doctors. You might say that it is good for me but it is not good for you. When you are always on the computer it erodes you eye-sight over time. "@CAPS2, many people wear glasses now more then ever. @DATE1 @DATE1 in the local newspaper, they had a chart that showed how many people ruined their eyesight over the years from computers. It went up almost @PERCENT2 from @DATE1 year and @PERCENT3 from the year before. Almost everyone that has a computer and is addicted to it has glasses. Have you looked outside lately? Have you notice that @DATE2 is coming and there is leaves on the tree now? If you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer then I doubt you were. Computers and technology ruin your time with your family. Many jobs on the computer how out it isn't a @NUM1 job. In that time you could be spending time with your precious little girl or even the best friend out side in nature having fun. @DATE1 year I wanted to play catch with my dad, but was on his old computer doing what he does. I didn't want to play alone so I just stayed inside and went on my computer for the day. Do you want that to happen to @CAPS1 person, everyday I wouldn't. Yes, people would rather be a couch potatoe and chat online, eating a bug of a million junk food chips instead of going out and interacting while slaying fit, but now it is important that you do. Just picture lazy, obese. People sitting on their couch all day with their eyes blood from stearing at the monitor for hours. But why do you than you @MONTH1 ask, it is because they never some outside. They never go for a jog or eat healthy foods. That is very unhealthy and can higher your chances of getting different cancers. Just ask @PERSON2 from the hospital," @DATE1 one guy was rushed to the hospital because of a very common cancer that you get from unhealthy living, he passed away @NUM2 days later. It was very sad." I strongly believe that being on the computer to long is a very bad idea. It can ruin you eye-sight, you never get to see nature and interact. But most importantly, it is very unhealthy. It is now or never, You would never know if you can be that man in the hospital with that cancer. The issue to grapple with is should you take that risk or stay fit, healthy and happy? So take a joy, eat a healthy, snack, and limit your time on the computer.

More and more people use computers, they love computers for place that are far or the news. Computers are good for everyone in this world. Know one can live with out computers. There's others dat don't like computer for nothing. I know that there's family or friends that be having computers they write each others like in myspace u could have friend from everywhere or family's. But computers are spending to many times on their computers.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have some opinions on technology is going these days and about how many people shun the idea of further advancement for the understandable reasons that it brings people away from family and that it draws people's attention away from the rest of the world I do see their point but I'd like to make a point myself. While statistics show a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities people also find more things to do and now that the world is more concerneD for the environment you will probably see people coming outside again because they heard about some new environmental actavist group to join or they watch a movie that makes fun of live action role playing and decide to give it a whirl. My point being that you never know what your going to discover in the media and its better than sitting outside all day with no insperation, waiting for your parents to get home and give you information from outside you tiny world. The other item I will mention is the music industry and how it is revolutionized with more advanced, and different ways of listening to it in fact the only problem in music today are the artist and how they take advantage of recording studies and on occasion another just to gain fame! Without doing anything but sit back and lip sync. But the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now. So why not advance and invest in the music industry, it will provide entertainment and fun for years to come. Advanceing technology is the music industry actually is probably good for the economey as well I mean if we didn'@CAPS4 have new @CAPS3 to bell to people every year that would be a huge decline in stock market prices not that were not in a crash right now but it wouldn'@CAPS4 be any better. That goes for cell phones too and any other piece of hardware that gets frequently upgraded it's just good for buisness. You see I belive that the point of life is joy so whats better than settling down with mabey a date some candlelight and a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V most people will enjoy just sitting down and watching the telly it's easy to relate to. The television has evolved in many good ways it's a way to lay down and unwind learn about so many different things mabey watch a show on @LOCATION1 it makes you feel like being there without actually being there. I helps us get updated on current events shows things that we want to do and shows us how to do it. I for example have learned so much from.

Dear @CAPS1-republican, @CAPS2 do benifit society in a positive way, but they also have a negative affect. Computers allow people to chat/voice chat/video chat with family members in other countries that would be very expensive or impossible over the phone. They also provide learning experiences with many resources at your finger tips. One posotive affect of computers is that they allow you to connect with people around the world. Programs like skype and allow you to video/voice/ chat to people around the world at no cost. Doing such the phone would be very expensive. It gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see. Another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides too you. The internet has just about every piece of information possible. Doing a research paper go to wikipedia and topics you'l find information. The internet can prove to be helpful. The @CAPS2 offers you many good mind/puzzle games that you could not ordinarily do. There are alot ;of good things on the internet. Many things that help get your mind flowing. Cant afford the newspaper? Read articles and stories right on the internet. The last reason I believe @CAPS2 have a positive affect on people is because it replace. Many people, instead of going to the @CAPS3 will go to the @CAPS2. No matter what are you doing, you are usually doing more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1. That is why I think computers make a posotive affect on people. Computers are sure to be our future. You can play games, voice/video chat and even read the newspaper.

Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the computeres have on people. In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, "@CAPS2 this", "@CAPS2 that", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs. Computure or a prime source of the data base, of @CAPS4, criminal records and so much more. With out computures how could catch the bad guy or catch the cancer before it's too late. Computure are key in many things. in the end you could go all day about the pros & cons of computures. But there so key in major aspects today, the pros out weigh the cons.
<START>

Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computer give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. "if a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month they would see a sudden increase in their gain. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one third their initial body weight until medical help was provided," say @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, @PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately those that spend alot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either. Instead of outing down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature, is being ignored @CAPS1, more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. "@CAPS1" @CAPS2 says "They're being overrun with woods and. Those are harder to act rid of that people." But it's live, the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what's left, well just let it do so. Hopefully though, the next generation of people will reconize this horrible mistakes. Doctors, @CAPS3, all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family. When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. @CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence, on society: people do not take, the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and Family interaction rates are poor. Whaat can we do to fix this problem? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers will be beneficial after all.

I do not beileve that computers benefit society. Kids can learn more but they spend too much time on line. When kids talk to people on line they don't know if it is really someone you know. There are techneral problems with them that deileate files. For these reasons is why computers do not benefit society. Kids spend too much time on computers. Computers do teach you more things, but they also have games. Children spend most of their time on games than studying. Chidren can get agressive when loss of exersise. Thats what is happening today. Kids are loosing exersise an are getting hevier. They can evan loose intrest. All they want to do is go on the computer. Kids talk to people, how do they know who they really are? People can make a fake e-mail adress and make a false account on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2-space. These people want children's personal information. Also if you are talking to someone that has a name of someone you know. The person just might be a freand. Like me. I was talking to @CAPS2 cousin on @CAPS1 (the account said his name) but it was his wife. That is why you need to be carful about what you say and who it is you are really talking to. Computers have virouses. When computers get virouses, they can deilete the files you want to save. If you had a video on the news you want to keep it. Youu put it under favorates, they you get a virouse that deleites the file. The video is how off the wedsite. Sometimes your computer doesn't bring you to the wed anymore. You how have to click alot of places to get there. For these resons is why computers are not benefical to society. Kids spend to much time on computers. Kids can talk to people they don't know on them. Computers have technical problems that delete files. Just remember there are many many more resons why computers are not benefical to society.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people and others are disagreering with this comment. In my point of view I believe that computers are effecting some people today and that people are spending a hudge amount of time on computers. The time spent on computers is getting outragous! Many people are just sitting home and staying on thier computer just playing games. Although the computer can be a great way to pay bills and come in contact with others faraway, people are taking advantage of computers and even billing others online. Since your not right infront of the person or near by the computer is a tool for many people to say threatning things without anyone else knowing which could cause fights, or other terrible things. The computer can also be very dangerous in many ways. For example sites like myspace and twitter can be dangerous for teens because of rapest. Some random person colud just start talking to you and ask you to meet them some where which could be dangerous. The computer is also dangerous because you could have inappropriate pictures posted on websites of you and not even know @CAPS1! The last reason why computers and laptops effect people is because of hacking. This is a big issue especially if you have a webcam. Some people know how to back your webcame and can watch what your doing without you knowing. People can also hack into your computer and look at all your documents. I think computers is a big effect on people today and this effect should be solved!

Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have both possitive and @CAPS12 effects on people. However, I believe that there are more positive effects than @CAPS12. Some of these positive effects would be that they are essential for education, a very usful place to communicate, and they can be fun. My first reason for supporting computers would be that they are very eduactional. For example, you can research almost anything. If you are doing your homework and you forgot an answer. An other reason why @CAPS1 is educational is because you can type your paper on @CAPS1 so your teacher can actually read your handwriting. If @CAPS1 is messy. On the subject, you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation. But how do you get @CAPS1 to your boss? Email of course! wich brings me to my next subject; @CAPS2. Another resoursful thing about computers is @CAPS2. There are so many different ways to communicate; @CAPS1's unbeleivable. Take I @CAPS4 for an example. You can @CAPS5 to peoples cellphones. You can @CAPS5 to other people that are @CAPS7 or you can just @CAPS5 on some websites such as @CAPS9, @CAPS10, and tons more. You can also vidio chat with people on things like and @ORGANIZATION1. Those are just a few ways of communicating on the computer. Finally, I would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers. First, you can buy games from a store and download them onto your computer. Personally, The sim are my favorite. I understand that computer games can be a negitive thing because they are addictiing, but if you don't go on for hours and hours, then I don't see what the problem is. Also, they have educational games so learning can be both fun and educational. Another thing you could do is play free games or download the game from the internet do your computer so they are both fast and easy. To @CAPS11, Computers can be both @CAPS12 and positive but I chose to look at things through a positive eye and I think you should too. After all, computers can be educational, a social networks and fun. Son @CAPS13 my positive eye... You wont be sorry.

Dear Local Newspaper On the subject of computers; Their pros and cons, I would have to say that both sides provide veru important reasons why you should and shouldn't use computers, I think that computers are very important to many students just like me. First of all computers help me and my fellow classmates with many asisgnmenrs. Some of us simply don't have the time to go to a library and look for a book that might nit even posses the information needed. On the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more! It also helps to develop your hand-eye coordination some peopel say "you can learn hand-eye coordiantion outside too? Although that is true, typing is very fats and neat. As you can see my hand wriitng is not the best but I type very fast and make little mistakes so I do not need the neatest hand writing ever.The way I see it computers are the fastert way of doing alot of things. So if you spend time writign neatly you might nit even be able to go outside and see nature. my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers. Sometime the easy way isn;'t always the best way thats why we must have balance. Do not infrom people to stop using computers but to balance thier time with them. Everything is good if it's balanced. for example, coffiene, In large amounts it is rather unhealthy but when you need a small you turn to caffiene and it helpd, same with computers. Besides, computers are now made everwhere, trying to get rid of them is simply unreasonable. We are already in a recession we dont need more trouble. I prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative. So you see comuters are evry helpful to some balance is the answer!

Would you like to discover new things and explore amazing mysteries around the world? Do you love to have friends overseas? Do you want to relax and do something fun after @ORGANIZATION1? Advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible @DATE1 decades @DATE1. We need to decide whether computers have positive or negative effect on people. I firmly believe computers gives society many benefits and opportunities. Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make @ORGANIZATION1 easier for kids. For example, @CAPS1 helps you with essays and reports. With her program teachers wouldn't hurt their eyes trying to read sloppy hand written compositions from students @ORGANIZATION2 helps you organize and calculate, @ORGANIZATION3 gives you the @ORGANIZATION3 to create dynamic presentations. Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their @ORGANIZATION1 tasks. @ORGANIZATION1 has also aquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take test. That saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees! Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. You can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere. Education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers. It is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. I have notices many teens play cool games on the net. They seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. It in an ideal way to relax after a stressful way getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. Some websites after downloadable songs for free so you don't need to worry about the financial part. Moreover you can watch movies online anytime, form wide section such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy or even children films. No more movie tickets, no more driving in the theater. Without a doubt computers can put a single on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. Many people feel that computers both kids and adults always from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world. Ten @DATE1 @DATE1, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with same one a thousand miles @DATE1, with no mail or telephone or whats over? I came to the @LOCATION1 @DATE1. I am extremely grateful to computers because I can keep in touch with my friends and relatives. I can just send them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here through just a minute. How much easier could it get? computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer. Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularizeas. They help you learn have fun and communicate with people faraway. Above and beyond all that new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees. Don't sit here and wait educate people about the benefits of computers today.

Dear @CAPS1: A @CAPS2. Can you believe that this tiny piece of technology is influencing our everyday life? The question upon many people is, do computers give a possitive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, although computers help with certain everyday life, I think that it gives one negative effects. I have many reasons for this belief, but the three most important are going to be stated. First of all, people are to busy on their computers that they spend less time. People are also in busy with there computers that they spend less and less time enjoying nature. Last but most importantly, people are so caught up with technology, they barely spend time with freinds and family. So, in my opinion, I think people should get technology, and the real world. Have you ever walked down the street and saw someone the size of a boulder? well it isn't a good sight is it? My point is, that can happen to you let me change that to everyone in the world. Nowadays, people are spending less and less time exercising, but instead sitting at home on the computer, or slouched on the couch with a laptop. People are ignoring their health and instead staying on the computer. I for one, know how hard it is to resist playing the computer, but you shouldn't let a tiny @CAPS2 take over your mind and now your future. Nature. The most wonderful thing in the world I say the second most wonderful to technology. Have you ever turned on the t.v. and see nature its beauty? Well you can thank and global warming for that. When people use computers they burning fuel which harms our environment. People are technology they don't care about their and surroundings. If I was a I would say, "@CAPS3 less computers and @CAPS3 more green!" @CAPS4..... it's luxury of having a family. Family and friends , it's most important thing. Sue to computers, many people are family and friends. For example: @CAPS5: @CAPS6 want to go ride bikes? John: @CAPS7. I want to play my computer. Kids and adults was single-handed. In my opnion family most important, unlike a piece of metal that has a screen In conclusion, I think that computers of a regular effect on people, life you people by it. People are spending less time with their health and exercising advance in technology. They are all spending less time at the park big or simply just enjoying nature's beauty. Most importantly, there is less interacting with friends and family. But, this is just my opinion, it won't mean anything if you don't agree. I consideration.

Dear editor, I think that computers are a good thing to have in the house. They're very helpful and entertaining. For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. "I love facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1," says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have facebook, skype, or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. "@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. "I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com," says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll. I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @CAPS1 everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is one of the most important things in the average home.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 posission on the computer contraversy issue is that computers are good and so vital in todays everyday world. Computers are a good way to communicat, they are most people main source of info and buisnesses use computers for various importanat task as well. Computers are a great way to comunicate. You can @CAPS2 with your friends, email your peers and now there are website you can go on where you can talk to your friends or a stranger. Being human I do sometimes forget @CAPS1 homework or school asignments. In that situation I would just go on @CAPS1 computer and @CAPS2 a friend asking them for the assignment. Its quick easy and it works. There are also websites where you can talk and connect with other people who share the same interests as you. Its a good way to make an online friends. The computer goes beyond just allowing you to talk enables you to connect with people no matter where you are. Do you ever have a question that you instantly want or the to? Just go to "google" or "@CAPS4", tpye in your question and recieve an immediatly. AHve a reaserch paper due on @PERSON1? You can do all of your reaserch online. There are thousands of website loaded with information can anything and evrything. Youc an enter yout topic a search engine and find hundreds of sources that way. You can easily fine information any subject you want, or find the name of that song you just heard on the using your computer. COmputer are used in buisness environment too. Computers are used for getting messages to different people in the. They are also used to create and presernt presentations marketing campains and now product ideas, also many companies use the internet as a source of advertiring and need the bublicity to sell their. So the computer is necessary for to function as well. So in conclusion computers are not over used, they are just used for so many things that at some point every one will nead one. They are a good way to communicate, an important and main source of info and they are also used in buisness environments too.

I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world. Store things on them, and use them for entertainment. Computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world. This is good because instead of calling people you can go on computer and talk to them for free. Long distance phone calls cost a lot. But if you can just go on your computer and talk to them there's going to be no charge. Being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun. If there wasnt a computer people would be talking to as much people and there social life would be bad making there life not as exciting. This is one reason why I think that computer have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers give a positive effect in people if you have a lot of paperwork that is just lieing around is in the way. Well if you have a computer there are featers that your able to store thing and because much more organized. Being more organized there is less stress one you start to feel better about lossing things and being able to find them. This is why I think that computers are very great and useful. The last reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use it for entertainment. Computers can do many things like play game, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with your friends. Being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome. If you cant aford to get a game system them you are able to go on your computer and play pretty much what ever game or close to the game that you want to play. A computer can also play music. You can have @CAPS1 and download musics to something or go to web sites that have musical on them. Also you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away. I hope that I convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people. Being able to play games, store thing, and chat with other people is pretty amazing.

Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you have a computer? @CAPS1 your kids spend all of their time on it talking in people or going on facebook or myspace? Well that’s fun and all for a few hours but some people spend a lot of time on there. They don't go out and get exercise or interact with their family and friends. Also they @MONTH1 end up getting in trouble in school or at home. If you spend all of your time on the computer doing whatever your doing you won't have time to go out and exercise. Not only will it be in appeling but it could be dangerous for your health after a while. All your time gets sucked into the computer and when your on it you feel like your not on for a long time and it ends up being like a few hours. It even happens to adults, my mom was on the computer for about an hour and she felt like it was only a few mins. When your on your computer for several hours you tend to got sucked in and not interact with anyone. I know this from experience. A few months ago I spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours. This effected my life a lot, I stopped going out on weekends with my friends, I always wanted to stay home when my family wont out. Then my mom confronted me about it and I realized all of my time on the computer wasn't good. I was missing out on a lot of things. Kids @MONTH1 also get at home or at school if they are on the computer for a long time they @MONTH1 not @CAPS1 their homework and end up failing a class and then stay back. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of the kids that stay on the computer for a long time end up either failing a class or staying rack. They @MONTH1 also get in trouble at home because they dont @CAPS1 their chores because their busy on the computer and neither the child or the children like getting in fights with one another. Now I know in a way it's good to have computers and be able to use them so we can look up information and its nice to sometimes talk to people on the computer for a little while but being on the computer for a little while but being on the computer for to long of an amount ran really mess you and your social life up. So all im trying to prove is that computers are an amazing invention but we should just use them a little less and get out and excersise, and have fun with our family and friend and @CAPS1 good in school and at home so we @CAPS1 get to spend some time on the computer. I hope you see it my way now.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about how technology affects people. My argument is that some people think that Computers are taking to much of people time, I will tell you how technology keeps people from excersizeing and gaining life expieriences. Now I will explain in further details. My first reason for sayi-ng computers affect people is that they cant get excersize when there face is glued to a computer screen all day. And especially with the amount of kids palying video games or playing on the computer, the childhood obeasity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting excersize or they will just get very weak. That is why computers have a negative affect on people by not letting them get the excersize they need. My seconed reason for saying computers have a negative affect on people is that they won't be able to gain life experience I say this because when something asks you "@CAPS3, what did you do today?" youre only answer could be "@CAPS4, can we chande the question to what did I not do today?" @CAPS5 when your on the computer all day you wont be able to explore and obseve nature well maybe you could do that on a @CAPS6 server but it isnt the same. And even when parent ask if you want to go for a walk you should do it, You could learn somthing or see somthing you wouldn't be able to see on a daily basis. That is why computers have a negative affect on people when their face is glued to a computer. So now I am going to close this letter and I hope you see that excersize and gaining life experiences will change your life forever.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 people are skeptic on whether or not computers benefit people. I strongly believe that computers do indeed benefit humanity for it allows people to talk online with loved ones and friends across the globe, and learn about those foreign places. Computers don't take away from lifes, but shows it through fascinating synthetics. Computers allow people of all ages to interact with others over the world-wide web. Sometimes it's better to meet with people in person, but that isn't always the case. What @CAPS5 you have relatives or friends in a different country? The internet is the best way to contact those people. Also, what @CAPS5 you are in a band or a group, and need to contact them while you are out of town? Social sites like facebook or myspace allow the group members to talk and discuss matters at the hotel or wherever he @MONTH1 be. In addition to both of these reasons, students can obtain missing work and email the teacher from his household. This allows the pupil to obtain his lesson and catch up on anything he or she has missed. The technological breakthrough of the @DATE1 known as computers allow interaction with other people as well as learn of distant lands. @CAPS4 people including myself, want some culture in their lives, and wander about this lively planet we call earth and find out whats out there, but can not acheive said goal. The computer saves us time and money to do these things. All we have to do is open a search bar, type in a word, and boom, we are looking at @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, or even the fields of @LOCATION1. Any place you want is at your. In addition to this, @CAPS5 a new tourist attraction comes to be, whether it is an amusant park, a monument, or a historical find, the internet can show us this. We can see things we would be seeing @CAPS5 we were present at the place, but instead on a monitor in your home. The computer allows you to do @CAPS4 things without actually encountering their happenings. In conclusion, computers are helpful for they allow us to preform things we could not do under certain circumstances, like talking to people over the internet, or learning of foreign countries. Not everyone can do these things, but everyone who has a computer can.

Imagine how people felt back then when there weren't any great technology. What if you didn't see your best friend in years and you lived long distance? Well now its this advance machine called a computer. Its very great and its a well hands on activity, that helps you with eye cornation. However, @CAPS1 going to tell you somethings about this device and now it affects humuns daily life. Moreover, the catogories are have a great relationship, online cources, and be on the best local websites. Did you know about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a successful life with online-dating. There's tons of people who struggle with relationships. For example, one day my mom and dad got into a series of arguments. She felt that the relationship wasn't good enough and she needed to meet a better man. On the other hand, she decided to live a better life and find dates (over the computer) and live a new life. These are the fantastic things you can do on the computer to have a better relationship. Your a highschool dropout because you cant keep up with the class. You dont turn in your homework and fail every test. Also, you feel that there is nothing you can do to fix it. Well not so fast my son! Now you can take online cources to boost up your grade and make you feel comfortable. Imagine sitting at the computer, completing every assignment and doing every homework there is. Watching your teacher teach, to you through a webcam. There's nothing like it, in fact you get the homework faxed to you. Someone in this world is living this life, it could be you. There's new websites all around the world today. However, there is no better website with all your friends on it. For example, myspace, facebook, and twitter. All websites that can stay in contact with your best friends. Another, that can be even more intrested is webcam. It's live from home fotage face to face on the computer. How cool is seeing your friend when your not together? Third of all, communication makes the world go around that why more and more people meet new friends. In sum, as you can see there's a lot of fun things you can do on a computer. It affects humans lives because more and more people are intrested in this device

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 waste your time learning at home when thats what schools for? People are concerned that too many people are spending too much time on their computers. They spend less time outdoors, excersising, and enjoying nature! People need more time to interact with their family. People are concerned. They are concerned there is way too much computer time. One time my mom had just bought a new computer and I stayed up all night on the internet. When I woke up the morning I was so tired and I didnt want to go to school. I think you should consider less computer time. The more time people use their computers the less time they are enjoying the outdoors. Insted of talking to you on myspace that they right down the street at the park with them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in @CAPS2 that use alot of computer time. Interacting is a nice enjoy nature and have fun. Family activities is a nice, fun and enjoyable way to spend your time. You can go to park when its nice outdoor weather, go swimming, play sports, in the wintertime you can possibly go to the movies, go to the mall, have fun with the family dont waste your time on the internet. In conclusion, there is too much computer time and you as the newspaper editor I advise you to make computers more expensive so people can spend their money on something more usefull because there is too much computer time. My mom says that "more people use there computers, more that they put their feet in their shoes and walk outside!" @CAPS3 people in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 think the same. Please consider my opinions the right way. Thank you

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever trully marveles at the computers in our generation today? Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someonehas? Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children. In order to help the wee-being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. "@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours! This pretty much takes up a lot of time, so families can't spend time with one another. One important problem that children and teens face are @CAPS2 oover the intenet are people known as "child predators." @CAPS4 people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter @CAPS4 "child predators; would you want to see your child be hurt by @CAPS4 horrible people? Computers are the reason, a with the internet for @CAPS4 accurances. Children and teens need to be protected from this major threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and thier lives. First, they don't allow people to be active and go outside.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 this ever happend to you? "@PERSON3, did you do your research?" "@CAPS3, my computer crashed." "@PERSON1 did you practice typing @TIME1." " @CAPS3, my computer crashed." " @CAPS5, why weren't you online @TIME1? I really needed that sales report!" "I'm sorry @PERSON2, my computer crashed." @CAPS6 it @CAPS2, you have realized that computers do benefit people. Whether its doing a class project, practicing for a computers class or exchanging buisness ideas, computers are a big help to society. First of all computers are a big help when it comes to a computer class at your school. There might be a certain speed that a person types and to pass the class, and the teacher could assign practice on your own home computer. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have some kind of personal ocmputer at home get @CAPS7 A's in their computer class. I can back that up as well. In my computers class. our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a little higher. Every @TIME1 I would practice but one @TIME1 my computer crashed, and I could not practice for the whole work with my luch the final exam @CAPS2 on @DATE1 instead of getting a @CAPS8 or A, I got a @CAPS9+. I blame that grade on not having a computer at home. Secondly, computer can be used for learning @MONTH1 different things as well. Maybe on a class report you needed to write something about the traditons of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Instead of running over to the library and wasting your time with a book. You could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet. Not only does it make for less time, but @CAPS6 you look it up on the internet, you will get way more search results than @CAPS6 you search on a library derectory. In addition, by using computers, you can look up the cutomers of a foreign country, or look up programs than could help you learn a new language on computers, you can not only learn about your own country but you can learn about foreign ones. Thirdly, computers can enchance many skills that are needed in the modern buisness word, such as socialization skills communication skills, and even learning about the younger generation. @CAPS6 someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program. They would not make it in the world of today. The people need to learn to intract with each others, and solve problems. @CAPS6 someone is not used intracting with people, they @MONTH1 not make a good buisness man or woman. People must be able to communicate as well @CAPS6 people do not communicate with each other. We will all end up dies in the headlights. We will al be lost and will be able to run buisnesses, or hold meetings, for example I needed to plan at adore for my project group to work on a project, and so I went on my computer hoping they were online basically they never showed and so I could not work with my partners at all. I ended up doing all their work. In conclusion I hope you have absolutely coundered my opinion about the computers have on people like I said, computers can be helpful @CAPS6 comes to computer classes, researching foreigh affairs, and even communicating with others thanks again for even reading this letter.

Dear local newspaper, Those who do support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I, for one agree with them. Computers are wonderful devices that allow people of all ages to learn about the world and it's people. It allows people to talk to family members that live far away, freinds, or sometimes buisness associates. Technology.. also provides education. Don't you think socializing, and learning are two very important aspects of everyday people? Learning new things can only be interesting if you can actually see them. Books can be helpful defending on when it was made. Internet websites can gives you pictures uploads almost every week. Therefore you know where you want to book your next visit. Yes books can give you tons of information, but not as much as the thousands of websites there are out there right this minute. Want to learn how to speak spanish look it up, fast and easy on the internet. No need to look and look a hundreds of books just to get one little fact. Throughout everything you do in a day chatting with friends is a good way to relax and have fun. Whether it's a close friend or a co-worker. There are now several ways to talk to friends, phones, texting, instant messaging, and even video chat! Yes it @MONTH1 cause time away from family, but you can easily say goodbye to the friend and talk to them later. Finally learning is a huge deal with people today. Well with this, advanced technology we have found ways to educate students in a fun way. Websites that are colorful and fun can teach kids how to multiply and read. About @PERCENT1 of children are more attached to colorful objects than books with words in them. So to all parents and guardians computers arent all that bad, they're actually very good.

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you love computers but fear that you or loved ones spend way to much time on them? If so, then maybe we should @CAPS1 something. Toomany people have issues with their vision due to starring at computers to long. Also, people miss out on other outdoor activities as well. Finally, if people are working off of computers for their job then there missing out on same of the other important things in life such as, interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or just simply spending time with their close ones. Now, are you for or against this descison of people getting "hooked" on computers? In my opinion people should be enjoying things and not spend most of their time on computers. Since people are so dependent on computers, sometimes working form one can hurt your vision. The bright white computer screen filled with all those e-mails can really affect your vision. I know my dad always gets headaches and his vision isn't the best thing when it comes to him working on a computer all day. Being indoors and on a computer all day long makes you really miss the outdoor activites that their are. Things such as sports, nature, riding a bike and many other activities are missed out because of being on a computer all day. Only fun and energized people get out and get active. Last but not least, @CAPS1 you enjoy spending time with the ones you love but seem to busy because your on the computer all day? If so then get up and go have fun! Take the wife and kids on a hike or go and ride a bike, its awesome excersise for you, family and friends and its actually fun! So, its now or never. @CAPS1 you want to be at home on a computer all day or @CAPS1 you want to be high energized and spending quality time with family and friends? Most impotantly @CAPS1 you want to be energized and healthy with no vision problems and stop those awful headaches? Well, without a if you get up and get active it will be the best decision you will make! So, get up, grab the kids and get going on your new and energized, pain free life.

Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to @CAPS2.com and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in @LOCATION1 then all this @CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'@CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'@CAPS3 do none of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people.

Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a majority of the @ORGANIZATION1 population will use any type of computer at least once a day. Our society has been around computers so often that some peole will find it hard to even live without them. Computers have become something that people depend on. This, however, is something to take as a concern. when people are dependent on computers too much, they loose valuble skills that the once possesed and they spend less time, outside exercising while also loossing touch with famly and friends. It has become near that computers have become along part of peoples lives. Computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place. We used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics. Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it. Today, however, people use technology to find this information. You @MONTH1 be thinking, " @CAPS3, how is this a bad thing?". The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to loose the ability to use books like encylopedias and atleses or even simmple maps. Once, most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from experienc, that I can barley look at a map and find where I am. We have become too dependent on @CAPS4's and computers, which in turn makes us forget valuble information. What would happen if someone got lost and they didn't have a working @CAPS4 or signal on their phones. They would get lost and not know how to read a map. As you can see the human population has because too dependent on computers. Additionally, people all around the world have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, @CAPS6 and even @CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with. When people begin to spend hte majority of their time on these websites, they will in turn get less excersise, and become more distant from family and friends. Mostly teenagers have this problem. If you took a survay of the number of students who have a facebook account or @CAPS6, you would probably get the majority. Having an account like this is said to be addicting. Students, parents and everyone in between will find troubles later on because of this. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any excersise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing it is now, I bet you there would be less overweight people. but not only do people become overweight, they will end up more and more distant from family and friends. My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. Once, the only way for us to really talk to her through facebook. As you can see, computers can be a dangerous thing. think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably thnks of quiet a few. Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less excersising and less communication which is proven to support a healthy life style. Also when people use computers too much, they loose valueble skills. Remember this next time you are someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them.

Dear newspaper readers, @CAPS1 this! Sitting at home on the couch eating a bag of potato chips. The @CAPS2 shows a beautiful picture of the @LOCATION1 you can almost feel the rain falling on you, you really want to learn more about it. All of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it. On top of that, you remember you were supposed to meet your sister today who you seen for years but you can’t! if you had a computer you would be to learn about more places and people, it would improve your hand eye coordination, and you could interact with people without having time to meet them! Computers definitely have good effects on people! First, computers help to improve hand-eye coordination. It is a fact that people who own one or more computers in a household have better hand-eye coordination than people without computers! Don’t you want good hand-eye coordination too? As a matter of fact, my friend @PERSON4 had the worst hand-eye coordination in our school, now that her parents have bought her a computer, she is a lot quicker and definitely has better hand-eye coordination. She said that just looking at the screen and she wanted to go helped a lot. Also, computer time can states that computers have been proven to improve hand-eye coordination in the course of a year. that sounds pretty simple to me! Next, computers also  allow people to learn about other faraway places and people. Local middle school teacher, @PERSON2, uses computers to teach her students about the @CAPS3 culture and geography. That sounds a lot more interesting than just talking! My cousins saw an article about @LOCATION3 once and they thought it was amazing they learned a lot about the culture there and actually took a trip there! Furthermore, vacations.com says that computers are the #@NUM1 cause of people traveling, because they see pictures and articles about places. You can learn about any place you want on a computer, doesn’t that sound nice? I’m sure there is one place you’ve always wanted to learn about! Finally, computer allow people to interact with other people around the world You can talk with your long lost friend who lives in @LOCATION2 just by the click to the mouse,(send). In a recent study, over @PERCENT1 of people just talk online to their friends rather than going out to meet them. How convenient! Also, expert computer teacher, @PERSON1, says, “Computers are geat inf you can't meet someone, you just talk online”. Have you ever needed to cancel a meeting? Computer are really beneficial to busy people. Now readers, @CAPS1, your sitting on that same couch you look at the @CAPS2 to see @LOCATION1, you quickly type it into your laptop and an article right in front of you read more about it learning something new in every paragraph. All of a sudden you lose your grip, but you catch your laptop just in time, what hand-eye coordination! Then you remember you were supposed to meet you sister @PERSON3, but you have a hair appointment. You quickly tell her via computer you cant meet her. She says it’s alright and you guys keep chatting it all worked out! It’s so simple! Computers teach hand-eye coordination, let you learn about more places, and interact with more people. So what are you doing readers? Get out there and get a computer.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, "@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends.

Dear, @CAPS1-@ORGANIZATION1 Computers... they are sometimes bad and sometimes good they're like people. Computers are helpful on finding information, making your work less difficult. But at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family. Computers have so much information that the news paper in the future will no longer be known. Newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch. Because of computers instead of getting info of what happen yesterday in what area you live with the computer you can find out what intersting things happen yesterday in the whole world. But thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project. About as an example cells and with that computer it will help a lot more than you think no need to write all slopy just type of cell's were you can find in the internet, print done it just makes life way easier than just writing drawing finding info of cells in book that waste good time to go outside and play with friends and family. Computer like I said are sometimes bad like people and it also like a drug. Because look at computers when people go on website like, myspace, twitter, facebook, communicating website or game website, theres whay to much to name. Its a drug cause you to stay on it day to night you'll get stuck to it and can't get enough of it and some people won't stop and it hurts there family, friend and especially health, like drugs they cause all the same thing. I think I proved my point of why computers are sometimes bad and sometimes good like people.

Dear local Newspaper, I think people using a computer has a effect. using a computer can help people in many ways. You can talk to people world wide, it helps you stay organized, and you can create very useful things like a or a power point using a computer. Talking to people world wide can be a very useful thing. Say that you have family members that live in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 you can keep in touch with them by e-mail or video chat. Also, if there is a national and nedds to talk to the other, governers around the world for advices help he can do that quickly and easily. Using a computer can also help you stay organized. For example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the light places. Imagine all of the papers and space he would use if he had to do by hand or didnt use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e-mail parents, and even create test or quizes and they know it will be nice and organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desk. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make alot of other things like power points. Power points can help them put alot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising. Lastily, you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday for alot of different people. Talking to worldwide can help you stay in, so you dont lose connection with your. They also have effect they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typeing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them?

Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has been a discussion around the @LOCATION1 for decades now. People cannot agree on whether computers are a good privelage to the society or just bumping it down year after year. I think computers do have a positive effect on people. This is because they teach hand-eye coordination, give them knowlege about cultures around the world, and allow people to communicate with one another. Do you think the downsides really outweigh these positives? Hand-eye coordination is not something you are born with. You gain it as you get older and acheive practive. Computers help with this goal. "@PERCENT1 of people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 frequently, have been horrible at catching a baseball before going on the @ORGANIZATION1, and after have caught every time." says biologist @PERSON1. And it not only helps with baseball, but with other sports such as juggling, golf or tennis. If you get very good at these sports, you can play them for fun, or even as a proffessional. Who knew that playing on the @ORGANIZATION1 could get you so far in life?! Did you know, according to "Time" magazine, that people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 are better able to focus on tasks, such as schoolwork, because it enables your hands and eyes to work together as one? And everyone knows that if you get good grades in school, almost any job you could be qualified in? Then, you can earn a good amount of money, and live your dream life!! Oh, great another @NUM1 hour day of school. Hhmm. What do I have first block? @LOCATION3 history. What? Yes! We're doing a culture project! That means I can easily go on the @ORGANIZATION1 and find out great things about what place I'm assigned. That's another up-put about computers. Easy access to tons of useful information. I have cheerleading everyday after school until @NUM2. If I have a project, I don't have hours and hours to look in books and find out what I need to know. Computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school. @PERCENT2 of people use computers to do their informational work about faraway places. It is faster and more accurate. You could just search through your bookshelf to find an almanac. But once you find it, you would need to check the copyright. Hopefully it's recent. If not, you're in trouble. Would you feel like prying through more shelves to be acccurate? Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2. All new ways to communicate with people. Just another useful effect on people. Forgot to write down your homework? Hopefully your friend didn't and you can just ask them. "@PERCENT3 of people don't chat with others online." says @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 expert. Most of it has to be for some reason or another. Such as homework, what happened that day, or how they haven't seen eachother in forever. Don't you chat with people online? Trust me, it can be a gradesaver. Maybe this will help you conclude that computers give a positive effect on society because of handeye coordination, information, and chatting. What would we do without them?
<START>

Dear trained readers, @CAPS1't you agree that more and more people use computers. Well I @CAPS2 because it gives us the information we want to see. Recently it has been brought to my attention that some people agree that some people @CAPS3 themselves don't really use computers. Without a dout I firmly believe that people that dont use computers should start to use them. but I can understand why same people don't use computers. Maybe they dont know how to use one have better things to @CAPS2, or can't afford one. First of @CAPS5, they dont know how to use one. I remember when my friend was over and I was on a computer. and he @CAPS4 "@CAPS2 you know that some people don't know how to use an computer?" And I @CAPS4 "@CAPS3 who?" the @CAPS4 "@CAPS3 me, I dont know to use one." I @CAPS4 well I'll teach you. Since then @CAPS5 my friend does is go on the computer. One day he says to me because of I want to work with computers. this is one of my reasons why people don't use computers. Second of @CAPS5, have better things to @CAPS2. @MONTH1 be someone has a game. for example, I mostly have how time to go on the computer. Usually I have a basketball game or practice I get home from practice and feel exhausled, @CAPS5 I want to @CAPS2 is go to @CAPS6. why parents come have not wanting to @CAPS2 anything. I'll tell you why. Because @CAPS5 that haved They @CAPS2 @CAPS5 day. This is another one of my reasons why people dont use computers. Third of @CAPS5 can't afford one. Some people dont have a lot of money to buy a computer. They have to say it. so they can live in a house. When parent's children asle for something parents shoudn't buy it. They buy it so you dont feel hurt. When I'm a @CAPS7 im going to make sure I have enough money to buy it. If not then I guess that child is out of luck. So dont be going where bragging your computer because some can't afford one. This is my last reason why people don't use computers. this is why some people don't use computers now in days. Because they dont know how to use one, have something better to @CAPS2 and can't afford one. By the way; @PERCENT1 of the pupils of @ORGANIZATION1 dont have computers.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society. I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today over use that power. You know what I mean @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts. Or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. People like the @CAPS4 do not spend much time with family members, or friends, or even just outside. They do not get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, physically or socially. Some people are working all day, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so that they rarely spend time with those they love. But if you are hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @MONTH1 just not spend enough time with family and friends. Using a computer isn't exactly a social thing. One person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. You @MONTH1 say "@CAPS5, but there are also online social networks." @CAPS5, but how often do you even see those people in real life? Computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. That certainly does not benefit society. A major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors. So you cannot be online chatting, or playing a game, or checking your email, outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. Sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors? Computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not well. That is the reason why pine tree's don't have outlets (although now you never know what they'll do next). Another side effect - that goes allong with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise. Once again, it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. When you live as a computer vegetable, your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be. Another reason computers could lower your quality of life. Now, really, if you use the computer sparingly, and only when you needed to, or when it is nessecary you would really have none at these "side effects." But face it, the ruth is, computers can be addicting. Wether it's waiting for a friend to come online or your trying to get to level @NUM2 of "@CAPS7 @CAPS8", they can get you hooked. The idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers, but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting-springly. So, now you know, computers when used to much, at obsesive amounts, are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting. As long as you use them correctly, they are a very, very valuable tool to be used, but over used, can be problem causing, and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends, getting exercise and even spending time outdoors. I know you certainly will agree.

I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. Therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. For example me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. If we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. Plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. My where you add up and subtract and divide. It's alot less words if you use a computer.

Dear local newspaper, I believe computers doesn't benefit society. I feel this way being that lack of email skills, no exercising, and its addicting. Read on for further explaing. Firstly, spending hours and hars on the computer gives you no social skills what on ever. You could think before you reply and most people online talk or write way differently there then in person. People could act like someone else. Online you could erase what you wrote but in person you can't. Thats way you simply can't gain social skills sending all this time talking online. Next, you get no exercises. On a nice beautiful @DATE1 you'll be inside on the computer when you could be getting exercise. Being on line sitting down doing nothing just talking makes you lazy. When you're older you'll have to be writing. You can't just good all these long house on the computer. Furthermore, you should have your time for on the computer and exercising. Finally, its addicting some people could good hours and hours on the computer looking up all these videos. Seven out of ten teenagers rather be inside in the computer talking to people rather then meeting new people elsewhere. I think parents should restrict their children's time to be on computers. All this time with this fun could be spent doing studying or something to help you out in the future. In conclusion, i believe computers doesn't benefit society. I feel this way being lack of social skills, no exercise, and addicting. I think some people shold limit their time another computer and expand their time doing something important.

Dear editor of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you know @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION3 own computers! Could you imagine a life without them? Computer do benifit society. I cant even remember the last time I went a day without a computer. All of this talk about computer being bad for society really got thinking. There is no way possible that computers are bad. for example computers are good for motor skills and what about school work computers help a lot when you forget your homework log at school and lastly sociability! I don't know about you but I couldn't live without computers! Computers teach hand-eye coordination! which we all know we need to play sports! Also with all the typing you do there is definatly some exercise for your wrists! I should know that they do because I woke both my wrists, at the same time and when I went to rehab they told me I should try getting my wrists back to normal by typing and having of calcium but that's another story. Computers are also great for school say that you forget your homework log at school so you don't know what you had for homework well you could call a friend but wouldn't adjust be easier to go online to the teachers webpage? teachers always have there homeworks listed on a school web page. And no you realize you forgot your mathbook to! have no fear the online textbook is here! and thats a lot easier then going back to the school to get it! don't you think? Lastly when you have a big project you can do research on anything and everything in the world! from ants to @LOCATION2 its all there. Here's a big benifit to society for you on all of the social networking sites such as facebook myspace and so man more arn't you able to leave comments on friends profiles or even chat with them! Which brings me to tm my next topics chatting on the computer! There is @CAPS2 and like I said before you can even chat on social networking sites. And lets say that you arn't able to watch the news cant you go online and check that to! There are so many social things to do on the computer and those are just some. So I hope those @PERCENT1 of people and even people that don't own computers are on my side. So we can prove that computers are good for motor skills, school work and even social networking. So please be on my side so we can show the public that computers are social!

Computers were built to help the people make tasks easier and quicker. Since then, they have been updated over and over untill what they are today. Computers are a part of most peoples everydaylives, and essential to most bussiness.But the common question in our society is, are computers really benefitting us? My answer is yes. Computers do many things for us. They teach us hand-eye coordinatin, give us the ability to research effectivly, and recently, became a great way of communication, @CAPS1's are definately benefitting us. One reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination. In a magazine I read, one expect, (@PERSON1) said that leading to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes. The speed that you type is improved with practice. Another way it improves hand-eye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively. I often on being ammused by playing games on the computer. These games usually are hard, but with my improving hand-eye coordination, I am learning how to play these games well. My father always tells me to learn my way through a computer because they are our future, soon, mostly everything will be done by them with the improving technokolgy, it is impossible for it not to be benificial to our society. Our home computers have been great at teaching me thing like hand-eye coordination. Another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper, just a click away. My garndfather always tells me how easy I have it. Instead of going to the @CAPS2 and having to pick out a book, I just go to google and have an entire search engine infront of me. When we go into highschool we will need a computer to suceed. To keep our essays organized, our research effective, and the clear to read typing right infront of us. My brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made. Last year, we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster. This way very easy considering I typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate. Computers have changed the way we research and finish school works. The last reason why computers are fantastic is beacuse they make communication just a click away. A couple weeks ago, my coach emailed us that our gametime has changed. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but without his @CAPS1, we would've missed the game. My cousin @CAPS3 is from @LOCATION1. Me and him meet only once a year. With that limited time, we can't really get out what we need to. Recently, i bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week. It is almost like he's with me. All the girls in our school can't get enough of me. So I get home after sports, go on, and theres always enough of me to go around. Webcamming is a great way of communication. With all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop. Well, the question still lingere, are computers benificial to our society? The answer @MONTH1 never come about, but at least for me, improving hand-eye, researching being a breeze, and communication just waiting for me is a pretty sweet deal. So for now, I stand by the opinion that computers are great, and extremely useful to everyone.

Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. Computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons. One computers let you surf online anytime you want. Two, computers allow people talk online. First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. This is very convenient. What if you live far away from the nearest library? When you have to write a research paper? Jane lives @NUM1 miles away from her town library. Her mother could drive her ther, but what if she wasn't at home or driving someone else to a doctor's appointment? This is when computers come in handy. Jane can just simply go online and do the research! Not only that but also, "www.internetsocool.gov" states that information you can find in a regular library is about @NUM2 of information you can find online. Secondly, computers let you talk with people both faraway and nearby online and videochat. This is very useful for me. Since I live by myself in @LOCATION1, I miss my family a lot. Although with internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want! Also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @PERSON1, the author of "@CAPS2 @CAPS3" also states in his book that over @NUM3 million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes. In conclusion, ivideochat @MONTH1 sound like something to do for lark, but it is actually used for many good purposes. On the other hand, some people say that computers are bad. Some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family. Although, "The @DATE1 survey of what people do," states that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally. Just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family. In conclusion in our culture because are very crucial in our culture because it can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live faraway.

Do you think computers are handy? I do believe they are very handy. Computers offer many things like Online shopping, @CAPS1 and even @CAPS2.V. Online shopping can be very helpful. Say you don’@CAPS2 have a car. Well you can go online and buy whatever you need at the store. People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games. You can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping. That is why I think computers are helpful. Chatting on the computer is great. Now facebook, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate the @CAPS15. On @CAPS6 you can follow famous people like @PERSON1 the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receicer. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people accounts. Chatting become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. you @MONTH1 believe its pointless but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer. This is also easier when maybe your in the car for a long road trip then you turn on your laptop and watch any show you @MONTH1 went @CAPS17 on the go is technology at its higher point. Thats why computers are so convienient. So now you have read how helpful, how its a neccessity, and the computer is convienient. Now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the @CAPS15.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an amazing piece of technology, but some people are beginning to abuse the @CAPS2. There are many benefits to having a computer. In my opinion I think that computers help people out a lot such as looking up directions or even chatting with some old friends. But many People are abusing the @CAPS2 and not @CAPS1 when to get off. The @CAPS2 is a very fun thing to be on but when your on it for too long, you miss out on family acvivitys, hanging out with friends etc. I think that there should be a time limit for everyone on the computer. If we had something that would shut off othe computer but save everything you were doing, People would go out more and be more active. Eventhough people @MONTH1 be learning about things on the computer, you have to know when to get off. Now on the @CAPS2 there are websites where you can watch exercize videos or if you even want to buy some exercize equiptment etc. The @CAPS2 can be a pretty handy thing but you dont want to be on it for long periods of time. I believe that having a computer can be a very cool thing to have and very useful when you need it. But there should be time limits for how long people stay on the computer.

Dear Local news paper @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, I'am part of the middle community. I read or the local newspaper that lots of people use computers and that not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In @CAPS1 opinion this benefits society in many ways because you get to work anywere you want, you could connect with family, and because it gives you the ability to learn about other places and people. You can get to work anywere because now in this days a cellphone, and ipod's come's with internet and with many things that you need to work that you have in a computer. We also have the laptop's that are to take anywere. You also got many programs on a computer to connect with family on others states or city's as in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @LOCATION1. Last, it also gives you the abiity of learning about other places, and people by photos, information, and websites. Like when it says the trategies that had happened in other states like the one that happened in @LOCATION4. This is @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benefit for society. Thanks for reading them and have a nice day.

Dear local newspaper, A question that recently came to my attention is people are spending to much time on the computer, and if this is a good thing, I believe that computers are a good electronic item to have. I think this because, it helps people learn. Also, people can keep in touch with their friends even if they I've in a different country. In addition, it can help people or students be @CAPS1 please consider this in our newspaper. Would you like students/people to have internet and searches that can help them learn? The answer is "yes". Having to computers can help students to learn. They can go onto @LOCATION2 and type in any question they want to be answered. Picture this a child has a question that she wants answered, but she is embarrased to ask her parents. She can simply type the question in on her computer and get hundreds of answers. There is nobody in the world that knows everything, but there are computers that do. Computers can give you the answer to any question. When my mom was little she didn't have access to a computer all the time. @CAPS1 when she had a question she would have to ask somebody she know. If they didn't know the answer than she couldn't know the answer. If more people had computers then they would the to questions. Computers are a good way to keep in touch with people. These are @CAPS4 programs such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, aim, ect.. My dad owns a buisness and needs to be in touch with people for seven @CAPS1 he around his iphone to talk to them by email. It helps my dad know when pappers and whos asking on what. I asked ten adults if they think everyone should have to a computer and ten out of ten said "yes." @CAPS4 people think that friends and family important and should stay with them every and a while. I have a friend who lives in @LOCATION1, but I cant contact her with my phone because are doesnt me and her talk on @CAPS2 all the time. @CAPS1 if people dont own phones then you can still stay in contact with computers. if they far away. Do you have perfect handwriting? The answer is probably no. People use @ORGANIZATION1 all the time because there handwriting isn't Computers help people stay clean and tidy. Computers have of folders and programs to store information you need. This all stays next all on the computer. My friend just get a computer for her office. Before she got it one hand everything and kep them all her desk in a mess. She had filled with pappers. But after she got a computer she typed everything neatly and kept all her pappers in the folders of her computer. She was @CAPS1 neat and clean that she got promoted. My friends moms changed because she got a computer. She became and cleaner. Picture this you are overwhelmed by all the papers on your desk. You dont know what papper is what. Well if you had a computer you could type eerything and keep them in your computer files. also @PERCENT1 of adults staying is good. I know you the local newspaper, have a very hard job and decision to make. I beileve that computers are good and helpful. Because they can help people find information they need. Also, they can keep people in touch with buisness workers, friend, students, family, ect. In addition, computers can help people get neat and clean. @CAPS1 please consider puting my essay in the Newspaper.

Are people today spending to much time on computers. If so had done it affect thous. In our modern day people spend to time on computers. Both me and think that this is affecting people in many different ways. Some ways it by. Health your social life, and also your education. Spending to much time on a pc can effect your in many ways. For example exercise. The people spend all there time siting in a chair they could have a chance of gaining wait. Then you might be getting all the you need because your on the computer you might not go to to get the and veggies. Your want to just so you the computer. Social life @CAPS1, you could have with all the people you are also will them. Another big problem is education. Is you are all day on the computer anything @CAPS2 you it's not on the computer you Those are some of the resons why I think people shouldn't spend to much time on the computer.

Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have a positive affect on people because they help students as well as many others study, they allow you to access stores by shopping online and computers allow people to communicate. After reading this letter, I assure you that you will agree with me. The first reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because they help students as well as many other people study. If you have a test or quiz in @CAPS1, you can go on your computer and print out @CAPS1 practice sheets. Or if you have a vocabulary exam you can find the definitions fast and easy on the computer. In the times @ORGANIZATION1, a statistic shows that @PERCENT2 of students in the @ORGANIZATION2 find computers there best studying tool. They find it affective and fast to use. Last night, I had a test on the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I went online, typed in "The @CAPS3 @CAPS4", and found @MONTH1 helpful cites on it. It was useful and did not waste my time. Using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier but their is on even greater one. Secondly, computers have a positive affect on people because it saves people time by shopping online. So many stores now allow you to purchase stock on me. it is easy .with a click of a button and saves you time driving to the stores. In @ORGANIZATION1, it showez that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 across the @ORGANIZATION2 said shopping online improved their lives by making it less hectic from driving from store to store. Shopping online creates a positive, less hectic life for many people around the world. Online shopping having a positive affect on people by making their lives less busy is a great reason but there is one last even greater one. The last most important reason why computers have a positive impact on people is because it allows people to communicate with each other. Communication through computers are extremely powiar. With instant messaging or email of even blackboard, a new teacher-student communication site, computers are often being used for communication. i surveyed @NUM1 kids and @NUM2 said that computers are there main source of communication. Communication through computers it has a positive affect on people in many ways like to communicate easier for work, to talk to your best friend on e-mail who just moved to @LOCATION2, or to simply send out invitations for a party to all your friends. Computers have made life easier for many through communication, making a positive effect on them. This is why communication having a positive affect on people is the most important reason. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people because it allows them to study easier, saves people time by shopping online, and allows people to communicate. With all the ways computers help us there is no reason why they would negatively affect us. I know that you will take this into cons ideration. Computers are making our lives easier day by day and who knows what they will be able to do in the future.

would you rather read six books to get that one recipie, or would you rather look it up in less than ten minutes? I think computers have an positive effect on people you can learn about places you want you need in minutes and you can talk to your friends inline Computers have a good effect on people because, you can learn about places you want to wish this @DATE1. For example, @PERSON5 wanted to wish @LOCATION2 this @DATE1 but when he looked online he saw how @LOCATION2 just had an earthquake so he changed his plans this @DATE1. @CAPS1, @PERSON2 said "I wanted to go to @LOCATION3 this @DATE1 but I know about it, so I searched on google and figure thatb this @DATE1 I will go to @LOCATION3" that is one positive thing computers effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit in the @DATE1. Computers have a positive effect on people because you can @CAPS1 find what you need in minutes. For example. @PERSON3 was looking for a cake recipie, he was looking many cook books but find it, so he took thru his labtop and found it in under five minutes, @CAPS1, computer experts @PERSON1 said "@CAPS2 of rooming thru books and books for information you nead why not go to the and the truxt me its much" @CAPS3, computers have a good effect on people because you can talk to your friends online, for example, @PERSON6 said "I moved from @CAPS4 to @LOCATION1 and I was sad to leave my bestfriend but knod how I can talk to her on @CAPS5." @CAPS1, @PERSON4 was in bed sick and coudnt go ourside to visit his friends so he kelf intouch with them on @CAPS7. Computers have a positive effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit this @DATE1. You can find what you need in minutes, and you can talk to your friends online just remember even computer report @PERSON1 said " me its much easier"

Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers.

Today, wherever you go, there is technology being used. The most common, computers are widely used by a majority of people, but are computers really beneficial to society? Computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world, a way to increase responsibility, and helpful for education. Computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world. You can use a computer to find anything that is on the web, so you can find information about places that interest you or places that you would like to visit. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people check the internet for places to @ORGANIZATION1 to before they actually go. @CAPS1, it is a way to connect with faraway friends. One of my friends moved to @LOCATION1 when we were in @NUM3 grade, but we still e-mail each other, and are still friends. The computer is @CAPS1 one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events. All you have to do is go to a news website. All of these connections will widen people's views of the world. Computers are a way to increase responsibility, too. When the people use the computer, there are many choices that they have to make, like what websites to go to and what to download or watch. Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is. Even if you choose the wrong choice, you will learn from your mistake. Second, the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of to handle. For example, you can't have any liquid nearby and must not throw objects near or on the computer. Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility. Lastly, computers are beneficial because they help education. Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting. For example, they can create points and presentation to providea @CAPS1, students can on what they learned at school. @CAPS1, you can make for the students, which provide them with their homework and information about the classes one of my friends once said "@CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing". Nobody wants to talk and a great way to present this. Lastly, if you want information on a particular school, you can just search it online and find its website. School websites have information about classes, events, and clubs. They provide the information that you need to think about going to that school in an easy, convenient way, while finding the website for the school take no more than @NUM2 minutes, actually going to that school for information can take more than just @NUM2 minutes, and even hours. According to @ORGANIZATION2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students choose what college to go to first by checking its website. The computer is an easy, convenient way to get information. Now, no one should be doubting the benefits of a computer. They are a connection to the world, like places, and people. They increase responsibility by giving you many choices. They help education by providing information about and for schools. This is why computers are beneficial to the society.

Do you think people spend to much time on the computer do. I think that kids and adults spend to much time @CAPS1, twitering, doing facebook and myspace. My resons include, people should go outside more, and play with real people, and spend time with family. Most kids should go out side more for example my friend @PERSON3 spent @NUM1 hours a day! on his computer and haven went outside. Another example is my neghbor @PERSON2 spent all day! in his basement playing on his computer and haven went outside and since he hevet went outside he is terreibely the sun and he is now @NUM2 years old an dhe still dont go outside it was because he spent to much time on the computer. Secondly, people should play with real people. For example there was a kid name @CAPS2 and he allways played with vertual people an dfrends and never realy pleople and now he is so shy around real people that he wont even say one word. Another example is @CAPS3 he only had vertual frend and never a real one and he is so depress becose he never had a best frend. Thirdly you should spend time with your family. there was a named @CAPS4 and he never spent time with his family becse he was to busy writing emails and @PERSON1 says that kids who dont interact with them wont have the same benifits as kids who do. Another example there was a family who were to bisy with the computer that the kids never met the grandparents and when the grand parents passed away the kids never met them becse they would rather play on there computers. In conclution people should go outside more, play with real people, and visit there family then if you want to play on your computer then after reading all of these examples then go ahead.

Many people use computers. Some people agrees that it benefit the society and others disagree. Some experts think people are spending too much time on the computers, and less time exercising, playing outside, and having family time. I think differently, computers help us with hand-eye coordination for jobs, stay in touch with family members and friends, and computers also help us learn about different things. Computers help us with many things but the most important is jobs. Many jobs use computers. In order to get a job using computers you need hand-eye coordination which computers teach us. Computers prepare is with skills we are going to need when we get jobs. Computers are very helpful. Computers also help us stay in touch with our family members and friends. @PERSON2 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 says that if we didn't have computers @CAPS2 wouldn't have been able to see her neice and nephew open their christmas presents @CAPS2 got them. @CAPS2 also wouldn't have seen her nephew take his first steps. "Technology is wonderful" @CAPS2 explained to me. @CAPS2 loves staying in touch with her families through computers. Computers are also help young children to old adults learn new things. Computers hold a lot of information, many people learn things they have never heard of on the internet. My younger sister @PERSON1 learned how to read on the computer. @CAPS2 is in the highest reading level you can be in, in first grade. Computers are very helpful at learning new things. Computers can do many things, they help us with getting jobs by teaching us hand-eye coordination. They can also help us keep in touch with our loved ones. Computers teach us about interesting things like faraway places and people. Computers are a wonderful thing to have in our society. Experts, their is no reason whats so ever you should be concerned with more and more people using computers, it's a good thing.

In the world we live in now, everything is getting technilogical. In my own opinion, its a good thing. Using computers has been very helpful to our society. They give people the opportunity to research things fast and easily, they save trees, and they're a wonderful way to communicate with people. First, computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste tree. A few years ago, kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library. But, nowadays it's computers. Sure, of course books are very helpful, but so is the internet, plus its much faster and easier to find to find the information you're boking for. You can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away. It really is magical. Next, using computers saves trees. With a computer we don't have to keep cutting down so many trees for books and paper. Another can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right. Honestly, there really is no reason to keep making books. Even students can do their home work, test and quizzes online! I think it's a mirical and it's so amazing to see how much our world has changed in only about @NUM1 years. Finally, computers are great to communicate with people far away. Some people have family in the war who they don't see for months or maybe years. With a computer you can get emails that get deliveres to the person right after being sent. Or you can even webcam and actually see the person face to face! It must be hard not being able to see your loved ones everyday, which is why a computer is very helpful. Even to those who have a family member away on a business trip or that live in another state/country. Computers are very helpful, especially today with everything going on in our world. With computers we can online research, save trees, and communicate with people far away. So, in my opinion computers do benefit society.

Dear local newspaper, I agree with the people that support advances in technology. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because they can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it can be educational. Many people believe computers are good for nothing. Even though they can be use for many things like research! For example, if you are a student you @MONTH1 need to do a project. Computers would be easier for you to collect research than a book. Another reason why computers are educational is because you can use them to read. You can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer. Not only is that education but that also helps the environment because you would be saving paper. Sometimes you @MONTH1 simply be curious about something, your computer will be right their for you to use. Computers also have another positive effect on people, they can be used for communication. Nobody likes a distant family, but with a computer you can communicate with family and friends from all over the world! This effect is positive because it helps everyone stay in touch. Many people have very busy lives and don't have time in write a letter or make phone call. So, instead those people could just quickly and easily send a email no instant message to who ever they need to talk to. Some experts are concerned that people too much time on the computer and less time excercising, enjoying nature and interacting both friends and family. These experts don't realize that you can use a computer to instead with friends and family. A computer many family thing. You can watch movie as a family or multiplayes games together on the computer. on the computer is a postive effect because while doing on the computer as a family you would for example, using a computer to be entertaind is safer than doing something entertaining . Where you and your family would be to many dangers. There are various reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. Those are only my main reasons they are many more. And that is why I support advances in technology and behave computers have a positive effect on people.

Dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are good to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in other places or with your family or friends or meet with people from other country and you can become frinds. They are also good because they help to develop cordination on your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. First of all I think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other county or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. You can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls. Secondly the computers are helpful because they help you cordinate your hand and your eye. This helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; You will be able to finish it on time. From your point of view you can actually se were I'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. The hand cordination can help you develop mentally sight. Thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy thing like a clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online. In conclusion I think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to cordinate body parts don't you agree with me?

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, People are using computers all the time but computers help us all the time in positive ways. Computers help us look @CAPS3 information, talk to people around the world, and buy stuff from our house. In a technilogical age the possibilities are endless. I have cousin in @LOCATION1 and I talk to him through webcam @CAPS1 are more people then who talk to @CAPS1 relatives elsewhere actually almost @CAPS2 soldier talks to someone back home. Doctors even say that talking to some one backhome give a soldier more will power to survive. Everyone goes to school, so that means everyone has projecets. During projects a kid want know everything so a good way to get information is to goes on the computer and search what your looking @CAPS3. The computer has trillions of websites that people You can anything fromhow man started to the. Be a sport person and @CAPS2 one likes to get @CAPS3 free online, @CAPS1 are websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 so you can. If you like that song go on @CAPS7, @ORGANIZATION2, lymewire, of any other store to and download to your @NUM1 or @CAPS8. In this time I hope you have learned more about the computer and have changed your mind. Even though @CAPS1 are bad people and bad websites doesn't mean the computers bad.
<START>

Who would have thought computers can have effect for people. People all over learn things on the computer each day. Of cours every body learns and reds new things because of the computer. @CAPS1 is even fun stuff todo on the computer. You can pick from many different music videos and music. And @CAPS1 are many ways to chat with people like over the phone on a cell phone. But @CAPS1 are computers too , @CAPS1 are many ways to communicate with friends/family. Also @CAPS1 is myspace, facebook and @CAPS2. Those @NUM1 are websites that you can go on to take to family/friends but theres others website that you can go on. But I would also like to comment something about the computer. I understand the computers lots of fun. Sometimes you need a brake you cant stay on the computer all the time. You must that you need exercize too. You must go out and enjoy nature. You should take awaile or ride your bike. You must understand computers are good for learning but not for eeryday life. The computer is good for learning but you should also go out and got some fresh air.

To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously needed in society. They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. Our teacher also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research. For example, last week in social students I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to @ORGANIZATION1- on the and sound a storage of information on the @NUM1 for my project on wehter capital punishment is and unusual. I found from this database that not onlt is it all lawed for that reason but the @LOCATION1 got from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which is instanly to carry the newest. most recent information I would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact. It would mre costly taken over two houses just to find the same information that five minutes using a computer. The internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method. As well as for research, school use computers to type papers. This moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check. Also, using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers. E-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are just @NUM2 of the commnly used websites on computers they make talking to friends and family easier and faster then ever. Last @DATE1 my friend on a business trip the was for @NUM3 weeks she missed him a lot @CAPS4 mom let @CAPS4 she was able to would have a telephone call. It consoled @CAPS4 for the @NUM4 days wasn't able to see @CAPS4 while still being amazing quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before. It is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them we don't need to worry about learning in life. Also in the closer future computer will be used in high school and college for helping paper researching and morw it will be faster and easier for us it we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventualy if can read the benefits are counters. As you can see, computers and the internet can any benefits iur society school can use them for many projects and learning People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face to face finally, it can help run the future. In conclusion compare use be encouraged.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being so popular right now it's easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them. However, I do do belive that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the people they are used by. I belive this for @NUM1 reasons. One, they take away from spending time with real people, they make people get less excersis, and also they are very distracting and waste time. One reason why I don't think computers have a positive effect on people is that the time spent on the computer could be put to better use by doing things with family and friends. Now and day people are using social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to talk with people far away. People can spend hours communication with someone they will never meet and completly ignore the people who care for and love them. Also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are. Overall, setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. This feeling can never occur through the internet. Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a lack of excersise for many people. People who use computers for many hours are just sitting still. They aren't being active. The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button. This is clearly not enough excersise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. Studies have shown that since the invention of computers young people especially have been gretting less and less physical activity. I'm sure that this will continue to get worse if people continue spending a majority of time on their computers. A third reason why I think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time. An example of this is that once when I was online doing research for a school project, I saw an advertisment for a website that looked interesting. When I clicked on it I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project. When I relized what I had done I rushed to finish my research and ended up getting a poorer grade then. I'm sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted other things to do on the computer. This is why I think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them. They take away from spending time with family and friends, they result in less excercise. And they waste time and are distractions.

Dear local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have been using computers for years. But @CAPS3 it good for there health. Were not thinking about what power teens have with the internet. If you need info. We have lots of great books. If we need communication we have phones. We need to go outside and exercise. @CAPS3 the computer another reason why america @CAPS3 becoming obese? First, teens can do harmful stuff on the internet to themselves or others. People have invented facebook and myspace. Almost every teen in america has a facebook. Did you know that theres cyberbullying now. People have humiliated others on the internet. How do we know that the person were talking to @CAPS3 who he/she say's he/she @CAPS3? Teens give away to much info of themselves, some have gone missing from such an action. The internet @CAPS3 a powerful weapon, but can teens handle this kind of power? Next, although the computer @CAPS3 a convient device. @CAPS3 it not true that we have something called books. We cant believe everything that @CAPS3 said on the computer . We can get all that we need and more off of books. People lived in the middle ages without computers, but with books. Why can we. Have we grown lazy to do such a thing as to get up and look through a book. Finaly, if communication we seek, then why not a simple text or call. we go through all the trouble of turning on and opening pages just to chat online. We have become lazy because of device's that have all we need in our homes. sure its a good thing but dont forget a bad one to. It seems like the computer @CAPS3 another reason for america growing obese. We need to get up walk, hang out with friends, do sports. But how can we when were adicted to computers. It's like a powerful drug. To conclude I think computers are not good for us. Teens with the power of facebook. Fake and dangerous info when we have book. Lastly, our own health. At this point I ask you, @CAPS3 the computer worth everything we think it @CAPS3? No, it @CAPS3 not.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years, the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising, and enjoying nature. Is this good or bad? Technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park. Computers do have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage exercise, advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature, and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world. Firstly, computers are full of great advertisements. Some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising. Studys show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, whereas only @PERCENT1 of kids with computers do not get enough exercise. These statistics show that computers are better for people's health than they are thought to be. Next, computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world. By doing this, people's intellegence will increase because they will learn new facts about new places. Also, people will be happier because they enjoy travel. Lastly, people's jobs will benefit it they're business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet. Finally, the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer. Social sites such as facebook alow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled. Webcams allow people to talk face to face up close about the new gym they joined. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people say they have a better social life online then out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise, encourage travel, and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world. Technology is there to make the world a happier , healthier, and more social place. That is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 our nain forest growing back, service that takes only a few second, and being able to find practically any answer to any question. What could cause this phenominon. The answer is computers. These electronic wonder help us and our planet in some many ways. because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information. You @MONTH1 be asking yourself how computers are ecofriendly. Well, for starters they help slow the waste of paper. Did you know that the @LOCATION1 kills aproximately @NUM1 million trees a year for book. Computers help prevent this in several way. For example instead of sending a short letter to the police cheif asking about what the new driving law is. You could send an email and save the paper. Also if you wanted the newspaper staff to interview the people that survived the power plant explotion you could send them all an e-mail with instructions to the surviers house insted of giving out maps individually. So now you see how ecofriendly computers are. My next reason was the eficentcy. My dell laptop @CAPS2 home takes about @NUM1 min to iload, @NUM3 sec to get on the internet, and @NUM4 sec to get to another webpage. So say that I want to know how many legs a centiped has (parents don't know either) without a computer it would take @NUM5 min to get to the library, @NUM6 min to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 min to find a book about cenipeeds. In total thats a least @NUM8 mins but my computer would only take @NUM1 min @NUM10 sec about. Also if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on @DATE1. I would only take a few seconds to send an email and she would answer quickly back, because she most likely on the computer a. My third reason was because computer are loaded with information, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 library I might find @NUM4 book on a sudject but on a computer I @MONTH1 find thousand. Once I was doing a report on monarch butterflys. @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 library I found @NUM12 books about them, On the internet I found @NUM13 wedsites on them! Also books have general information like just @CAPS5 life, but the internet has specific information the @CAPS5 part in the enviorment. As you now know computers help not only humans but the eviorments this is because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information.

Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive affect on society. I believe computers have a positive affect because they help us learn of faraway places, they help us communicate with friends and family all over the world, and computers help entertain people. The computer has a positive affect on society because on it you can learn of faraway places, their history, and you can learn of their landscape. By learning these things you can do a lot of things such as plan a vacation, this information can help you on a school report, also this information can help you learn of your heiratage & your culture. Also computers have a positive effect and are beneficial to society because they help you communicate with friends and family all over the world! You can communicate with anyone you know. Nowadays everyone uses the computer as their main form of communication. In a study it showed that @PERCENT1 of people in the world has a computer as a communication tool. Lastly computers are beneficial to society because they entertain us. On a computer you can do many things to never get bored. You can play games, surf the web, or you can watch videos on networks such as youtube. So on a computer you'll never be bored. The computer is beneficial and has a positive affect on society. The computer helps us learn of faraway places, it lets us communicate with friends and family all over the globe, and lastly the computer entertain us. Thats why the computer is beneficial to society.

I don't think computers benefit the society as much as every one thinks. When people spend most of their time on computers they don't have time to spend with their family, people don't excersise enough when they are on computers wich causes them to become obiese, and you @MONTH1 meet up somewhere with a bad person you met in facebook or myspace. These are the main reasons computers don't benefit society. The number one reason computers ain't beneficial is because you need sometime to spend with your family. But, when you are on computers twenty-four-seven you have absolutly no time with your family and friends. I belive that families need to eat dinner together and have at least one hour with one another. Some good ways to spend time with your family is to play games together, go on a walk, or even go to a bike ride together. Did you know that computers have a medium sized effect on how people become obiese? If you are at school from seven till -thirty and after school you spend seven hours on your computer you will become fatter because you will have absolutly no time to excersise. When you just eat and don't excersise your body will not just burn off all that fat you ate. When you are on a computer you are probably go on to facebook or myspace. On these chating websites you can make arangments to go some where with someone you don't even know. If you meet up with them they could be a killer, a kidnaper, or a rapist. So there for you can litteraly die or get hurt because of your computer. Thats why e-mail is the absolute safest way to chat online if your were to have a computer. These are the main reasons why computers are not beneficial to the society. Also you @MONTH1 not spend enough time with family or friends, you can become obiese because you don't have "time" to excersise and you can be kidnapt by someone you don't even know through facebook or myspace. How would you like it if you had no time with your family, you were obiese, and you got kidnaped because you met up with someone that thought was nice through facebook or even myspace?

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a vey unique and advanced device. They give entetainment, pleasure, and knowledge for some people. I do not agree with the fact that computers are a good part of society. Although you do need computers. There are some reasons to which I am saying this. Typing s faster than hand writing and its neater. With all the different websites, you can advertise and buy important thing bat the internet and talk to people froma round the world. With all of these good reasons there should be an instant choice of it they're good or bad. But there is a main reason. It's areason that tells it is bad. Computers are for people. People had can't get off their write a hand written report or drive to the store to buy something. Not it. If computers never exiled, the world would no doubt be better all around place. There a lot of reason in which computers are bad. They hold information which can be hacked and by somebody thay you don't want to know something. Cyber bullying is a bad thing about computer. Another big is those stupid online games. People get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese. So as I said before, part of society and should be. This would be of good importance to me if you took my letter into. Remember that computers can take advantage of your life and make you into you're not. make that descision I hope that you live a full life and enjoy reading my letter. P.S. Try not to get involved with any online games being in a nationwide disease.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 editor, I have recently seen on the channel @NUM1 news that you want to know about the. Computers have on people. In the past, everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 agree computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination. Dr. @DR1 expert in relationship to humans said, "People without computers cant do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time." To sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination. The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. when you can't look up and learn about places, you are not about them. You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friend ships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you.

@CITY1 @CAPS1, Computers are very helpful devices. Life would be very hard without them. Not only are the helpful, but they are fun and easy to use! I believe that computers have a great effect on people because you can keep in touch with family and friends, go on school websites and use search engines. Friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives. Computers can help you keep in touch with them! the @NUM1 applications that I mostly use are @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 is a free online application that you can download to your computer, add your friends, and video chat! using this, I keep in touch with my @CAPS4, my friend who moved, and even a friend from @LOCATION2! @CAPS2 (@ORGANIZATION3 instant messeger) is where you can send messages to friends and get instant replies! It is just like text messaging, only through computers. Lastly, @CAPS3 is a website where you can add friends from all around the world! I am friends with tons of family that I don't get to see very often, a friend who moved to @LOCATION3, and many other people that have moves! @CAPS3, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION1 are great ways to keep in touch with other people! When you are home sick from school and need to make up school work, instead of calling a friend from each of your classes, go to the school's webpage! All teachers should have their own website that you can get from there. On their pages, they should have posted homework, quizzes/tests schedule, favorite links, projects, and their e-mail address. I find this very helpful because even if you don't understand you homework, you can e-mail you teacher! Not only do school website have teachers pages, but they also have lunch menus, events coming up, the school address and phone number, and many more! School could be a lot more difficult without a website. Do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it? www.Google.com has the answer to everything! you can find webpages, videos, pictures, translators, etc. Google is not the only search engine on the internet, there is also @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION2!, @LOCATION4, @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, etc. These can all help you find answers, pictures, videos and many more! I often use these to find pictures for a school project, webpages for research, translators to check my spanish homework and videos to show my friends! if we did not have search engines, life would be a lot harder. Computers, as you can tell, are extremely helpful, easy, and fun to use. People love them and use them all the time. I hope that you agree with computers having a great effect on people! Staying in touch with family and friends, having a good education, and finding answers within a click is the easiest way to go!

Dear Newspaper, Computers have a huge effect on society, can you even imagine where we would be without them? They are great for communication, learning, and shopping. Computers have a large effect on people. Without computers, communication with co-workers, family, and friends would be nearly impossible. Social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4-In play a huge wrolein everyday life. These are the sites you use to access information from others to making plans for the weekend. Do you think that your children use the intrenet too much? Nowadays, that is their way to communicate with their peer. It makes them more social, which is a great quality to have in life. Also, I don'd know about you, but I have talked to many people around the world using the internet. It gives you the chance to experince other cultures. Communication was absolutely not as easy before having computers. It @MONTH1 seem hard to believe, but you can learn tremendous amounts @MONEY1 things from the internet. This @MONTH1 include learning about people. How would you video chat with someone without @CAPS5 or @ORGANIZATION2? You can learn a lot about a person from talking to the face to face, a thing that can't be done on a phone. Also, research for school could not be done without the internet. In a recent survey, @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM2 teenagers said that they use a search engine site, such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS6, or @ORGANIZATION3 at least once a day, @CAPS7 out @MONEY1 those @NUM1 said that it is for school. If it weren't for these search engines, children wouldn't be doing too great in school. Clearly, the computer provides ample ways to research and learn on a daily basis. It @MONTH1 sound rediculous, but in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 shopping was done on the internet. If someone wants to start a business, their first stop is usually the internet. People are making @MONEY1 every year with the help @MONEY1 computers. People find it easiest to buy something with the click @MONEY1 a mouse. It is easier than the hassle @MONEY1 crowded malls and long lines. Also, do you remember when @CAPS8 @DATE1 was the time to put the alarm clock on for @NUM4 @CAPS9? Well, how people do @CAPS10 shopping online, there are hundreds, even thousands @MONEY1 sites that offer great sales. Now think about how purchasing items would be if it weren't for the internet. It's not agreat image, is it? As you can tell, computers have affected our lives in a great way. Communication, learning, and even shopping have become much simpler. Many @MONTH1 think that computers are not bad to have, but the good over shadows those aspects.

I support the advance in technology especially in computers. Using the computer can teach hand-eye coordination, give you the ability to learn about faraway places or people, and give you the opportunity to talk online with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill to have. it quickens reflexes during everyday life. Hand-eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball, football, or basketball. Without computers, many people would lack hand-eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country, but doesn't know anything about it, he could lost it we on the internet. The internet is a major part in having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Some people @MONTH1 think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise, which is true in some cases, but the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computers is almost a neccesity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they @MONTH1 know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend, and one day meet them in real life. This @MONTH1 be dangerous for younger people, so be careful. I support the advancement in computer technology because it gives people greater reflexs, gives people the opportuniyt to research faraway places, and gives people access to the internet to chat with people online. These are three huge advantages than using computers give people.

In modern society, @CAPS3 is rare that you come across someone who doesn't know how to basicly operate a computer. According to the statistics project known on youtube as "shift happens", most children in the @LOCATION1, @PERCENT1 in facts, have used a computer by age four. While @CAPS3 can be debated that computers are bad, i firmly disagree. Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. they have helped education, reconnecting, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and i hope that after reading this, you will too. At my schoo, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. Wheni look at these amounts and addit to what i know about computers in other @CAPS1 schools, @CAPS3 is clear to me that computers have helped the education system. Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button. There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. Also, teachers can put their grade books in their had drive. This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade. As a student, i think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways, but mostly in those above. At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. There are social networks such as facebook, twitter, and @CAPS2, that are valuable for finding your friend from @DATE1 camp. Let's say you have been connected with someone, and you've just found out that you got a promotion. You want to call, but you don't know the hone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at @CAPS3, ask for a phone number!) @CAPS3's always great to talk with old friends. Computers have helped @LOCATION1 make that easier. My friend recently purchased a sony laptop. She liked not only the features, but that @CAPS3 was an energystar, or eco-friendly. Now a days, computers have been made green in the battle for the environment. Paper is saved with online encylopedias, newspapers, journals, etc. Not only that but computers are needing less and less electricity. You save green and are green! Today's society is helping mother nature not only in our actions, but in computers too. In my opinion, computers are helping @LOCATION1, not hurting @LOCATION1. They have assisted education, social reconnecting and the environment. We must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom @PERSON1 was a size six in the waist. @PERSON1 would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. @PERSON1 quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (computer game) and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. @PERSON1 is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad @PERSON4. When @PERSON4 gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, @PERSON3 became a member of @CAPS4 @CAPS2, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when @PERSON3 was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, @CAPS7 take my suggestion seriously and bann computers.

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to @CAPS2 attention that we are debating on weather or not computers benefit society. Well if you ask me, I think @CAPS1 does. For one computers help with entertainment. Second of all, they're very information. Lastly, computers make life less stressful. In the following paragraphs I will explain on @CAPS2 reasoning. Firstly, computers give entertainment. Now I can see why people say we should go out side more and excersize but, what are supposed to do on a rainy day? Well, you could go on the computer! Plus, computers give children enjoyment and make them happy, instead of being sometimes. Another reason why computers are good, is they can give children modivation. Say you're child really wants to play a new game on his favorite website, but his homework isnt done you could tell him if he gets his homework done he can play on the computer. Also, you could give him a time limit on @CAPS1 too. Lastly, for a teenager or older they are more social than little children. They go on things like ; twitter, facebook and myspace. Computers is probably their @NUM1 or @NUM2 way they communicate. Unfortuneatley. Some people abuse these rights and people get in trouble. But the good thing is you can customize you page so that won't happen. Any way children become more social. Secondly, computers are informational. They can tell you a lot by just the touch of keypad and the click of a mouse. You can search someone or something across the whole world. If you want to know the mother and how to prepare for @CAPS1, just look @CAPS1 up and do what you have to. Also, if you find out something new tell people, you can spread the knowledge. Thirdly, computers make things less stressfull. which would you rather do, type or @NUM3 pages? Well I'd type! computers make things more organized so @CAPS1's easier to find things. @CAPS1 also makes @CAPS1 easier to find things, like files because you can just do to "@CAPS2 documents" and find @CAPS1. As you can set computers are an important part our lives. Can you imagine a world without computers? I sure couldn't! So far i've said computers are entertaining, informational and make things less stressful. I hope you take @CAPS2 letter into concideration.

I agree with the many peole that but benefits society. Computers can be used as a learning tool, allows communication with distant family and friends. Lastly computers give you something to do in your free time, such as playing games. First of all, I know many people think that others wasted their time on computers. But most computer users us the computer as a tool to learn and get work done. There are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want. If you want to know more about different cultures such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. There are websites to tell you everything you wih want to know. Computers also help yet work done. There are multiple programs designed to make writing papers or presenting information much easier @MONTH1 people use these programs to yet ahead in their work and present facts easier by using these programs it is very hard to lose and work that you do because it is all saved into the computer. Next, computers are agreat way for many people to pass some free time. Many websites are designed for this reason. Some allow you to play games and other websites let you watch video made by other people, while some people @MONTH1 spend to much time on this many offers know moderaton and spread their time even other websites hard videos that are used to portray important issues, for example the president has given many through @CAPS4 videos because more often people are on their computers and not watching television. Lastly, computers are a great way to communate with distant firends and family. There are so many ways to do, such as email, or many of the social networking websites. My family being immigrants from another country my family. Thinks this is a vauables tool for talking with our family, and I am sure that htere are many ohters who use the computer this way as well. People also make and keep in touch with great friends through the @CAPS4. I use @CAPS3-mail as a way to keep in touch with many of my friends that I haven't seen in tears, my parents have also found long lost friends that they had before we moved through facebook I also allows people to communate important ideas faster than a letter could. Many scientists use the @CAPS4 to publish ideas and experiments. Finally, I agree with people who sad computers benefits society computers help by being a tool to learn and get work done, pass free time and see important information and lastly computers allow communcation with very far and distant family members.

Dear Newspaper, I think that when kids or even adults get computers, then they would not use it for good causes. When people get computers they spend more time inside and on them. They need to get outside get some exercise. Even little things like, if your going to your friends house, then take a jog there instead of your bike. When people spend more time on their computers than talking to your freinds, then they will be low on socializing and, after awile won't know how to communicate with people. All they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise. Computers could also be used for good things. If you have a project for school and need to type it up on the computer or find pictures on the internet then the computer would be a good resource. If you have a job for working with computers or fixing computers, then you would spend a lot of time on your computer. It also lets you interact with people on the othe side of the world. You can also learn about interesting facts or places. Computers could also be used for bad reasons. When people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got. This can lead them into getting obese. They can also use it for sexual harrasment for stalking people. People can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or illegal things. So as you can see computers aren't safe in a lot of ways. I hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them. Thank you and have a good day.

Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs @NUM1 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer @NUM2 its bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go me go on the computer, but she @CAPS1 makes me go outside and run around @CAPS1 people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger chilld the wrong ideas. For example I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad peole post videos and the little children could see then and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time and with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad.

Dear @CAPS1 I would like to inform the public that using computers isnt so bad. The first reason I think make computers good is because of the people we can meet via @CAPS2, yahoo, @ORGANIZATION1 or gmail. For instance we could meet someone from @LOCATION1 and learn about his or hers culture or beliveths. My second reason I think computers help people is because what if someone didnt have @CAPS3 or the newspaper he or she could get the @CAPS4 news via nbc.com or fox.com and will be able to still find out whats going on in the world.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 percentage of people all over the world do you think have a computer and think that it has a positive effect on them? Well about @PERCENT1 of the world says that computers are a great way to communicate with friends, family, and different people around the world. They also mentioned now its a good hands on-eye coordination on adults and students. A wonderful educational source to use in schools, jobs, etc. First off the reason why I say that its a great way to communicate is because of the programs that computers have memoried into them that are little numbers all around universe to connect with your friends, family, and people around earth. For example like yahoo, facebook, twitter,, myspace, etc these are all types of ways to communicate with people and bring more social which is a healthy way in life. More than half the world have these communication source because one it easier and you get more of your mind. Another reason why they @MONTH1 have these connections its probably because its a better way to see one another if you live in different parts of earth. The reason why I said that its another way of seeing people around the world is because right now I'm living in @LOCATION1 and in order to see the ones I love and care about is by my myspace and facebook to be able to see my family and friends that lice that live in different locations from me like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3, etc. Another reason is because its a good hands on eye coordination on adults and students.

When you use or computer, you have the ability to do virtualy anything. The internet has millions of users and makes life a lot easier. You have acess to talk with people who are all the way across the world! You can search any topic and learn more about it. The internet even encourages you to get outside and see things for yourself. In the @DATE1 it just a seasy to contact someone in @LOCATION1 as it is to contact someone at the other side of town. As long as oyu have a internet connection you can stay in touch with a friend thats moved aparent on a buisness trip, anyone! Some @MONTH1 say that you should just use a phone but you could use video chat on the internet. You can see someone who's thousands of miles away, as if they were right infront of you. These days its harder to not stay in touch than it to stay in touch. @NUM1 or @NUM2 years ago any information you neede came from a book. You would have to go all the way to the library, find the right book, and read it. If you were lucky you could find a bit of what you were looking for. These days you simply type it in to a search browser and you instantly get thousands of webistes on that topic. The internet allows you to learn about any subject you'd like. You can spend @CAPS1 experts or give that some poeple spend too much time on thier computers. Seeing all those great places and beautiful pictures encourages @CAPS1 poeple to get outside and see it for themselves. On a recent poll @PERCENT1 of peopel went on a hike after seeing a youtube video about how great it is to get outside. The internet has a massive effect on us. It can also bring families together. For example at dinner, you can get a great recipe off the internet. In fact, you can get millions of great recipes. The internet was an amazing idea. @CAPS1 would argue that it was the greatest invention ever. Yes, it can be dangerous, but with proper education on it the internet is a good source of information and an @CAPS2 pass-tie, if not abused. Being able to see and talk others so far away was seeminly impossible a few decades ago. Getting information has never been so easy. We are lucky to live in an age where the intenet is right at our fingertips.

Dear @CAPS1 post, I know that people are spending way to much time on computers instead of being out side. People are becoming adictied to computers. People are spending way to much time on computers because there addicted to them, over weight, and not getting any exercise. I am telling you we need to address this matter. People have become addicted to computers. @PERSON1 says that in @DATE1 there were @NUM1 people useing computers, and it @DATE2 there are nearly @NUM2 million people using computers, that’s a big increase in the last copple of years. People are becoming more addicted because of facebook, twitter, and much more computer sites. Yale says that in @DATE3 the number of people on facebook was only @NUM3 thousand in @DATE4 there is over @NUM4 million people using facebook, I don’t know about yoe but that seems like an addiction to computers to me. People are getting tramensly over weight. One cause of this is addiction to computers, people just sit infront of there computers and eat and eat and eat until there over weight and unhealthy. Dr. @PERSON2 says that in the last @NUM5 years the average weight of a person has gone up @NUM3 pounds due to them sitting in front of their computers and eating. Doctors say thay can’t do any thing about peoples weight unless they turn off all of there computers witch they don’t think is possible. People are just getting to fat from sitting and doing nothing all day. Exercise is a key part of staying healthy. And by sitting infront of a computer eating, you'r not getting your exercise that is needed so people are getting fat. Dr. @PERSON3 says that people need to be aware of this problem. Dr. @PERSON3 also says that in the last @NUM7 years the amount of exercise people are getting has decreased @PERCENT1 that’s why people are getting fat. He also says that it’s due to sitting infront of the computer and eating. People are getting no exercise due to computers. I’m telling you this is a huge problem that we need to address. People are becoming addicted to computers, there getting over weight, and getting no exersise. Pleas @CAPS1 post listen, it’s a problem, but it is your dessision.

Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that negative effects of computers on people is much greater than the positive effects. Computers have caused a massive amount of obesity in the @LOCATION1 and that number is growing everday. Computers can also be time-consuming and people could spend hours and even days on a computer without doing anything else. Lastly, computers can be dangerouis to many kids and could even end up in death. I feel that xomputers are too harmful for society and should be stopped. Obesity is @CAPS4 of the biggest problems in the @LOCATION1 and is growing bigger everyday. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population is obese and computers have been a major conributer. Put yourself in the mind of a computerf addicy. It is dinner time and you are hungry, but you don't want to lose too much time off of your computer. You hurry down to the nearest fast-food store and by yourself a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. You then go back to your house and eat the food while on your computer. Not only is the fast-food bad for you, but you dont even give your body a chance to burn @CAPS7 those calories and carbohydrates that you just ate by exercising. Computer addicts do this almost everyday and before they know it, they are. @NUM1 pounds! In addition, people who thier hand-eye coordination can do it in every other ways than just going on a Computers contribute to a large portion of the obese population, but they also can be extremely time-consuming. People on computers waste a huge amount of their timer. These people stay on thier computers for hours amd sometimes they dont even realize it. They say "@CAPS1, let my check my email. @CAPS1 look, I recieved a @CAPS2! @CAPS1, let me just change my @CAPS3 acconut." @CAPS4 thing thing another and @CAPS7 of a madden, @NUM2 or @NUM3 hours have already passed by. People who stay on computers @CAPS7 day waste precious time could be spent with family, exercising, or finding a true love. Time is sao precious in our lives and we must not waste it staying o a computer @CAPS7 day. Not only can they be time consuming, computers can also be dangerous. Kids around the country are being killed, raped, and bulled @CAPS7 to computers. They show thier pictures on chat sites, give away too much information, and enough. They have a critical knocking on their front door. Also, those been who suicide because they were bulled on the @CAPS5. Cyberbullying can be just as harmful. If not more harmful, than vregular bullying. These kids fare such strong mental and emotional harm that they make bad decisions, including suicide, and @NUM4 in school. In addition, there can be explicit content on the @CAPS5, including pictures and video that can harm a child's young mind The danger of computer is so great than they should be @CAPS7 in @CAPS7 computers are too risky for whivh is why they shouldn't be a time consuming. Lastly they can be extremely dangerous to children. Because of these should be banned from @CAPS7 society for the well- using of the @LOCATION1

Dear @CAPS1 Local newspaper, I heard that you were concerd about people and how they use the computer to much. I think that computers are a good thing to have because many people use computers for school, work ect. I think that computers are good use, many people use it for research and resources. It is easier to use them, when you are going on vaction because you can check out how much hotels are, where resteraunts are, and what interesting places are there, instead of calling/driving around. Computers are good for school because I think books are harder/longer to use than computers. Also for questions you can go to one of the websites an you ask the question and many other people might answer the question your looking for. There also useful for work most people use computers for work. They can put there taxes/documents on there computers. Computers can be used just for fun too. There are chat; facebook games. I think that computers are useful for many things, but I also think that some people spend too much time on them too. Computers are great, but you should also use other things too like maps, book, ect. Many can spend @NUM1 hours on the computer facebooking and gaming. I think that it's important for people to go outside and hang out with friends. Alot of people spend there time on the computer during @DATE1 because its cold and sometimes snowing. I don't think that they should spend there whole time on the computer though because you dont just want to depend on electrictronics everytime. I think that computers should be used not alot in the @DATE2 because I think hanging out with friends and family are important and also the weather nice. I think that computers can be very useful with directions, work, school work but you shouldn't spend alot of time on them. Electronics arent everything in life. Thank you for taking your time reading this and I hope you do agree with me.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers are benefitial to society even though some people don't because they give us a means of communication, computers give us the ability to learn about forein people or places, and computers help businesses in so many ways. Computers are a most have in a society. Computers give us a means of communication such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6-mail, and so much more. Without the computer, families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button. @CAPS5 lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night. Long distance calls cost money and it is not worth @MONEY1 a call if you call every couple of days. Communication has evolved so much in the past @NUM1 years. Computers are just the bigginning. That is why computers are benefitial to communication. Computers give us the ability to look up facts about forein places and people in a matter of minutes. We could look up who was the @CAPS7 of @LOCATION1 in the would get multiple sites on the @CAPS7. Computers help us expand our learning capabilities and give us a chance to learn things that normally we wouldn't. That is another reason why computers are very benefitial to the society. The last reason that supports the fact the computers are benefitial to the society is because computers help keep much of data. Work data and they help @PERCENT1 of businesses we file reports communicate with other branches of that company. I learned in class that in the job were much more difficult than they are today because of technology. Some people think that using computers deprives people of going out and exercising. It only takes @NUM2 minutes ti check your @CAPS6-mail, or look up something. Computers are benefitial to society because without computers, our lives would be much more complicated.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think we should have computers for great purposes. One reason is because there is a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on many different websites. My last reason is because you can send messages to a faraway place by using e-mail. My frist reason states that there is a lot more information on the internet. For example, if youn don't have the newspaper with you, but you have you laptop, you can get information that way. Did you know, over @NUM1, @NUM2 people use their laptops for information and not games. Another example is if we get the newspaper everyday but it doesn't have the article that we are looking for, we use the internet. When we look for information on the internet, you would use yahoo, google, and other informational websites that you need. My second reason states that there is some history on many different websites. For instance, you can go on a websites and learn about history everyday, insted of going to a museum about history everyday! One day, I had to make a project about the @CAPS4 and I had four days to do it, you know what I did, I went on a historical website about the @CAPS4. I got an A+ for my project. When people need history, it's always all around them on the internet. My very last reason states that insted of texting people from faraway places, why not just use an e-mail address. For example, you don't have to pay for an e-mail address. It's actually free and did you know, more than @NUM3 million people around the world use an e-mail address insted of texting other people. When you don't have an e-mail address, it's very quick to make one. You don't have to waste money to text someone halfway around the globe. In conclusion, I think that we should have computers. One reason is that we have a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on some websites. And my last reason is because you can send messages to a far away place by using e-mail. Thank you for reading this article.

New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers is a benefit to society. Most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them. No matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, " I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eys off the screen. Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isnt' all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicans put together. If you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plety of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing whats going on. Do you like to stay organizes I personally, think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people need the computer to do their job and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working humans is a larger amount. So, thing about it, if computers weren't made, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would not have, jobs, or they would have to keep everything down on paper which @MONTH1 be a catastrophe. After a while, you @MONTH1 want to back everything up by copying all of your photos, files, music ect. to a @CAPS4 so you dont loose everything if your computer shuts down. After reading this, don't you agree with me, that computers are a benefit to society? There are many more reasons but this paper had alot. I hope you have realized that without computers, the world wouldn't be as it is today. Thank you for your time.

Dear @PERSON1, I am writing a letter to discuss the fact that computers have a negitive effect on the average american, here are my reasons people are not spending much time outside, lack of exersize, do not interact with their family as much. Not spending much time can have a big effect on mother nature. Such as they will begin to care less about our wonderful earth and not care to pollute because if they took the time to go outside instead of running the air conditioner they can save the money and go be with their friends. Lack of exersize can be very bad for your health. Sitting down all day on the computer is not exersize its lazyness. When you exersize you feel good about yourself, your adreniline starts going, you can stay fit and you wan't have to worry about being unhealthy if you take yourself away from the computer. When you do not interact with your family and instead of eating dinner together one persons on the computer and the others are waching @CAPS1. You might argue with your family a lot and don't you want to have a healthy relationship. So why don't you encourage your family to sit down at the table and discuss how your day went. I stated my reasons why I think computers have a negative effect on people. I hope that you agree with my reasons so we can find a way to get everyone their computers and get active.

Wouldn't you like to find a @NUM1-star hotel or resteraunt with a click of a button? I know I would like to. So should we keep using computers for the good of our society, or not use computers to exercise more? Computers are helpful to us by doing work that has to be done neatly. It also helps by accessing and surfing the internet to more useful stuff. A computer is very intelligent and not only can came in a boring, heavy, boxed shape. Computers are also in some electronics. If you go on vacation and forget to turn off the lights, you can use your hand held computer to turn it off. Communication is pretty easy on a computer. All you need is computer (of course), a microphone or headset, some speakers, and a special software. After you have all of these, you can connect with the rest of the world! Talk to loved ones or family members through your computer. If you want, you can also get a web cam. A video camera used on your computer. Then you can see others face to face! If you do not have anything what I just said, there is also texting. Just use your computer keyboard to type and send a message. Your computer can also a lot more things. You can play mindless video games! Your computer must have the right specifications to play it. Sure it might be pricey to

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? Of course you @CAPS1, that's where you get all the information you need. Computers are good and everyone should have one. The computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know. It also lets you communicate with your family, friends, or other people you need to communicate with. It can also let you see disasters in other countries and teach you about the world. Computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways. Computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know. If you're in school and you need to @CAPS1 research, well there you go, you have a computer to help you. This is also good for jobs. Any one can use them and learn new things at the same time. It let's you @CAPS1 work, learn new things, and it's fast and easy to @CAPS1. You don't have to @CAPS1 all that hard work of looking for a book and spending so much time looking for the information you need. Computers are great and you should use it. Another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them. If you have family or friends that live far away or in another country, then you can communicate them by computers. You can easily webcam with them or e-mail. This is very easy and this way you can stay close to them. This is also good if you @CAPS1 business online. You can @CAPS1 your job and talk to the people you need to talk to. If you ever have to arrange on emergency meeting and don't have time to call the people you need to, then simply send them an e-mail and your set for the meeting the next day and so are they. This is a perfect way for communication and business. My final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and you really wanted to see them, then you can go on your computer and see the news and learn new things and see what bad things have happened. Also if you live some where that isn't your home town, then you can go online and see what is going on at your hometown and visit for any special occassions. You can learn a lot of new things about other countries. Also you can learn about new places if you ever want to move to another country. You can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation. This is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places. In conclusion to all of my facts, computers are good. It lets you learn new things and @CAPS1 research. Also, it lets you communicate with family, of friends in case of emergencies. Computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries. If you have a computer, then that is great. If you don't then you better go out and get one because these computers are awesome and can @CAPS1 just about anything you need. Stop waiting and get online or go out and buy one.

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people are using computers for excessive amounts of time a recent study confirmed this reporting that "@PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day". That means people have less time to exercise, enjoy nature and socialize. I consider that the benefits of computers are greatly outwayed by the problems that arise from them to up, computers limit a person's health-both physical and social - and do more harm than good to siciety. Spending too much time on computers can deteriavate a person's health by preventing them from spending that time exercising take for example @LOCATION3, who goes on computer at least five times a week, for about four hours. @LOCATION3 has stopped playing soccer and because she prefers to spend time on facebook. Instead of recieving six hours of exercise a week. she now recieves an hour this has to @LOCATION3 gaining weight and losing health. The problem is there are millions of children like @LOCATION3 who are not getting enough exercise instead opting. to spend too much time on their computers. Another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature. Now, they choose to surf the web instead. This nads to people caring less about our planet and animals. Nature is very important and can be extremely fun, so this is a shame. Furthermore, those who choose to spend overwhelming amounts of time on computers tend to interact less with family members. No longer do most children help cook, clean, do chones, or spend time with siblings. One mother says "ever since my daughter got her new laptop, she hasn't gone once to play with her baby brother or friends" unfortunatly the same is true for most teens today computers have limited nou, much time families spend together. In conclusion, computers do harm to society they keep people cooped up in their rooms, istead of exercising, enjoying nature, or having fun with their families and friends. In doing so, computers have become a mause to society. Therefore, @CAPS1 is crucial that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time to exercise or socialize, even to do nothing at all would be better overall, computers are no longer beneficiery to society.

Dear local newspaper, I has come to my attention that many of us disagree on weather computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers do not benefit society. Many people in today's modern world spend way to much time on the computer when they could be exercising, spending time with family and friends, and enjoying nature. Read on and I am sure you will agree. First of all, computers are becoming a problem in society because they interfear with our physical well being. The @LOCATION1 is continuingly growing. Not in our population but the size of our people! According to a recent survey @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in the @LOCATION1 are overweight or obease. "The main culprit of the @ORGANIZATION2's percent of obeasity is not over eating it is actually electronics! Especially things like computers." said @PERSON1 a surgean at @ORGANIZATION1, after dealing with a severe case of obesity. Obesity is not a hard thing to get rid of. All we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen. America needs to get outside! It can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk. Whatever you do just get off your computer and go outside or the gym for exercise! Secondly, computers interfere with family and friends. I know from personal experience that parents hate it when their kids will miss family dinner or won't go out with their friends because they "need" to finish the next level on their game or they "need" to look something up on the internet. Family and friends should be a very important thing in your life but unfortunatly, for most people it is not. Psycologist, @PERSON2 has discovered that overall, having family and friends that you can count on beside you will make you a much happier more enjoyable person." @CAPS1 eliminating computers from our lives we will create a happy and more pleasent society for the people of the @LOCATION1. Doing everyone a favor. Furthermore, if we cut back on our hours on the computer we will have a better chance to expeirence the wonder's mother nature has to offer us. Most people don't realize how much they are missing @CAPS1 not going outside. There are amazing things, right in your own backyard, that you will probably never get to expeirience because you are too addicted to playing on the computer. @NUM3 years ago people were able to function fine with out computers so we should be able to too. @PERCENT1 of people have never even been camping! So next time you feel like spending another @NUM4 hours on the computer, take a walk and I'm sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors. In conclusion, computers do not benefit society. They just keep people away from going outside, enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends. I hope I have convinced you to see my side of the argument and thank you for your time.

Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a negative effect on people. One reason I think this is because people need exercis. They shouldn't be sitting at a desk all day playing games on the computer. Especially kids should be outside playing and exercising. More and more people will become obess if all they do is sit at a computer all day and eat junk food. If more people execis more people will start eating the right food and many people will be much healthier and live healthier and happier lives. My second reason on why I think computers are negative is some kids @MONTH1 get cyberbullied. This is when someone gets bullied online. Kids do this so they don't have to say it in person and they could say anything they want and the other person @MONTH1 not even know who it is. Another thing is kids @MONTH1 meet someone they don't know and think is nice but you don't know who he really is. He could make you, by tricking you, do stuff that normally you wouldn't do cause you think he's your age or he likes you. Many girls have gotten taken because of this. My last reason is people could miss out on fun activities, with family or friends like going swimming in the @DATE1 or sleding in the winter. If your home at the computer you can't do fun activities outside and exercis while doing it. Theses are my reasons I think computers have a negative effect on people.

Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I belive that computers offer a lot more pros than they do cons. Computers offer another way to learn things about the world. Computers @MONTH1 also act as a research, tool. If a child, or anyone @CAPS3 on the computer and a family member thinks it @CAPS3 an unreasonable amount of time, that sounds like it @CAPS3 just an issue between the person and his or her family. Many people @MONTH1 argue and say, "look in the encyclipedea to learn about the world, "but a computer @CAPS3 faster, easier more time efficient to use. In fact, most people in the newest generation of families probably don't have an encylipea set. For example, if I were to want to learn more about @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 of searching in a dictionary or encyclipea, I could go on the computer, type in @LOCATION1 and a whole slew of liks and opportunities are found. Some people @MONTH1 like the old ways, but personally. I like the freedom and easiness of a computer. Have you ever had to research for a project or report? Many people either in school or in the work field will most likely need to research something to get a better understanding. Yes, a dictionary @CAPS3 helpful. Yes a thesauris @CAPS3 helpful but there are separate things. Compared to a computer those classic research tools are still usefull, but could be a hassle. My point @CAPS3 a computer has a dictionary thesauris, encyclipedea...ect all in @NUM1! So next time you have to research something try reaching for the keyboard @CAPS4 of the bookshelf! To me, the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a Family problem than a social problem. Technology has changed our world! Ever since computers were invented not only have they downsized, but became more and more useful. The computer has opened more doors for our scociety, without computers, space travel for example would not be the normality it seems to be in this generation. All im trying to say @CAPS3, I don't think computers hurt our society, but are pretty much the building blocks for our world. While reading this paper I hope you noticed the pros of having computers in this world. A computer @CAPS3 a help learning tool, the king of all reaserch tools and a big part of our society today.If you could learn one thing from reading this paper, I would want you to think, "@CAPS5 would we, as a world be without computers?"

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 register, I am writting you to urge you that the affect computers have people is helpful. The reason I say the computers are helpful is because it helps give direction helping the economy and because you can send messages thru quickly (instant messaging). Read on so I could let you know how and why these things about the computer are helpful. @CAPS7 I know I said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this. You know when you need to go out somewhere far and you don't know how to act there and have no @CAPS3 in your car. Well then think about it on computer is your only option left. Like for example when I was going down south @DATE1 we didn't have no @CAPS4.P.S and we didn't know how to get their. So our only option was the computer. We logged on to google on found our direction @NUM1. So this is the first reason @CAPS7 read the next on. Okay, okay, okay. @CAPS7 we all know the way our economy is rediculous. Away computers helping our economy is instead of people driving to go pay there bills, they could pay online. Because it's saving money and the state won't have to pay for questions to get gas for the cars often or get re-build. Like for example this gas station near my house is getting re-built because something went wrong with the pipes @CAPS7 this is costing us all about @MONEY1. @CAPS7 say this isn't away we could save the economy. Its about time to move to the next reason. Listen here, here, here's my @DATE1 reason how computers are helpful. Im other known as instant messaging. This is helpful if you don't have a house phone nor on cellphone and you wanna tell you a family member or friend something really bad had happened then you could tell thru by instant messaging (@CAPS5) because they would surely would get it. Like one time my friend aint have a house phone nor cellphone and somebody was trying to brake into her house she had instant message me to let me know because it could get send to my cellphone. And I called her mom to let her know and befor I know it another massage was coming thru saving "@CAPS6 you." @CAPS7 after reading how computers are helpful by helping give direction, save the economy and instant messaging, could you agree with me saying computers are helpful. Its still your opinion but you read minds so think about what you read on say it isn't true.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves. This is why I think that comperters aren't positive in society.
<START>

Did you know that in a recent poll in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers everyday? Computers have a very positive effect on people, such as informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away, interacting with others, and learning new facts. Can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers? They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes. they would know righ away just by clicking on the internet. Another example is if there was a shooting nearby. People would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed not only doe computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but @CAPS4 their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and is always looking online for any traffic updates so he can avoid them and get to work on time and safely, without computers people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they @MONTH1 face. Another positive affect computers have on people, is letting them interact with others, such as video chatting and instant messaging @PERCENT2 of the world video chats and instant messages. It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger realationship nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? Computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle. A third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things. Students' main source for education is through the computer on the internet. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, "Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning". They are @CAPS4 helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class. That way, the won't need to lug around heavy books, and strss out for forgetting them, @CAPS4, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, malking their knowledge grow further. Without computers, lives wouldn't be the same in a negative way. Computers help people know news, traffic weather directly, interact with people, and learn new things. therefore, computers are very positive, since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use them now positively, why stop?

Dear @LOCATION1 harold, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits socity. Those who support advancences in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. But computers can be a bad thing. They can deprive children from excersizing, enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends. First of all, Computers can stop children from exersizing. "@CAPS1 I can never get outside after school, because I'm checking my email." @CAPS2 high school student. A recent studdy shows @PERCENT1 of students at a middle school @CAPS3 when they come home they go right on to the computer. This shows that almost half of the students at just the middle school are on the computer. This is way computers can be a bad thing. Secondly, some children spend more time in the grate indoors than the outdoors. "I spend most of my time breathing in airconditioning (or heat) than fresh air." @CAPS2 middle school student. Imagine, a child is staring at a computer screen playing a game or on facebook mean wile it's a beautiful day in the middle of @DATE1. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students @CAPS3 that they spend more time indoors than out. Computers can be a bad thing in a childs. Finally, computers can interfere with a childs time spending with family or friends. "I @CAPS1 spend an entire evening at a family party on these computer." @CAPS3 elementary student. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 homes have a computer and it is beang used @NUM5 by children. This shows that little @PERSON1 of the @PERSON2' house hold is never out side playing with friends. Computers can do more harm then good in a house hold. It can stop children from exercising enjoying the out doors and spending time with family. I ask you to tell your children or grand children necies nephues to cut down on computer time.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 we all know more and more people are using computers. Some believe that this would be a concern because it affects peoples health. I believe that with the advances in technology it would give us positive effects on people. Here are three reasons why, first would be that with advances in tech. It would teach us to be more intelligent. Second would be it it would give us the ability to have access to intresting things we can't get at the library like biographics and finally access to communicate online. My first reason @CAPS2 I mentioned before was it would give us intelligence. If we have questions to something we dont know we could search on the computer and find our answer. We would learn this and would be able to teach others. The computer can give us alot of useful information that can benefit us in the future. My second reason is that advance in tech. would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us. Not all information is found in the library the computer has access to biographics educational website and most important the access to educational advances for example online tutoring for students with difficulties in school. My third and final reason why advance in tech. would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication. Some people will have e-mail for good reason for example teachers have e-mail for educational cause if a student is having problem in work, the student simply send the teacher a e-mail of the what the students difficulty is and what the student can do. That is all I have to say for now. I hope you think about this
<START>

Computers have a positive effect on peoples lives. They are big helpers. They teach you skills you need in life. The technology abilities help us with tasks every day. Finally they help people to keep in touch and meet knew people. I think that computers have a very positive effect on our lives. Computers teach us many things. First of all just learning how to use the computer is a skill you need in life. At most jobs you have to know how to work a computer. Today computers are essential part of most work enviornment. Hand-eye coordination is another skill the computer teaches you. Computers actually help you with sports in a way. To catch a ball you need hand-eye coordination. The technology the computer gives us helps us alot in life. If you need directions you can look it up on the computer. If you couldn't you would have to call the resturant for directions. Without the computers help we would all have to write all of our papers out. For students it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer. We would have to read so many books to get the information. The world would be a much different place without computers. Sometimes people who we love have to move far away from us. It's hard to keep in touch on the phone when that happens. The computer through keep you in touch. With programs like facebook, twitter, and @ORGANIZATION1, its possible. You can chat with them pictures of how there doing. You could even keep in touch with them from @LOCATION1. Computers almost anything possible. In conclusion computers are great machines. They teach us life long lessons. They help us when we need something or have to do a report. Computers even keep people in touch so their relationships don't fall apart. I don't know about you, but I think computers keep the world up and running.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 are so many people that addicted to computers. They think that computer can help them but yes to others it helps them to their work and education. Most children are addicted to computer games. @CAPS1 are @PERCENT1 of children who are addicted to computers. For some reason, computers had a lot of effects on people. It might affect children's education or it might be the cause why your bills of electricity went higher. The worst of having computer at home, it can be a reason for millions of teenagers that got killed for always talking online with people they don't know. Computers are sometimes dangerous for people. Do people still need computer? Having computer at home is not good specially to children. This is because computers can affect their education. Parents don't want that to happen to their children. A lots of uneducated children that stay home or do drugs in the street. Yes computer can help them for their studies or computer can help them for their studies or projects but other children in the computer because they just want to play games. That's why a lot of them didn't learn anything at school but they learn a lot in the computer games. They should stop the computer games. Also, having computers at home can be the cause of people's electricity bills that went higher than they had @DATE1 when they didn't have computers. Other people think that computers can't give you any problem but computers works with electricity and pay for the electricity bills. If you have @MONEY1 for your electricity bill @DATE1 year when you didn't have computer, it might go high to @MONEY2 for your bill that now you have the computer. It's a big problem for you. Nevertheless, computers are dangerous. Computers can be good or bad. Without a doubt, @PERCENT2 of teenagers have been killed because of talking online with strangers people. Most website like @CAPS2 is now in danger. @DATE1 @DATE1 months, husband and wife got killed because of @CAPS2. The husband killed his wife because of being "single" in her relationship status on her @CAPS2. She got shot by her husband. However, her husband killed himself. They're both got shot! Talking online and meeting up with strangers people you don't know can be a reason of your lost. Parents should not have computers at home unless they will use it but it needs to be at their room where children can't use it. Now is the time to agree! Do we need computers at home? Can we live without the computer? We don't need computers at home and yes we can live without the computer. We can do any activities with our family, exercise for our health, go picnic with friends or we have fun go on vacation with the whole family. Local newspaper, I want you to tell the people to stop the computer and tell them to go out with their family and have fun doing activities or go on vacation.

Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work. Overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer. But, some times it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1. Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line. Also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @CAPS1. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @CAPS3 be bullyed at their safe place, their home. Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise. A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said "every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers." @CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. Lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students. Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend to much time all the computer. I was waching discovery chanel and it said that @CAPS3 most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework. The computer made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!

Dear @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I understand you think computers don’t have an effect on people. Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. It also helps you with your work. Never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decition that you want to make.

I think that computers have a good effect on people. When people are on the computer they are not on for very long. I also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new technology. Computers are positive and they can help you when you are stuck or need to look something up. To me computers are positive. When people go on the computer ther are not on for @NUM1 hours straight. Sure they might be on @NUM1 hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school, meals and activities. Some people need computers for their @CAPS1. News @CAPS2 companies need computers for editing and printing out the papaer. They also put the news on there website. What would most people do without a computer? Computers are positive because of the new technology! The new technology is helping people interact over the. if you have a long distance friend or family member, there are how many ways to talk to them. You could use @CAPS3, skype, oovoo, @CAPS4 or even email. When I go on the computer I dont just sit and watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or @CAPS7 online. I interact with my friends @PERCENT1 of us population between the ages @NUM3 have a @CAPS3. @PERCENT2 have skype or oovoo and talk to people that are too far away to visit. Computers are positive because they can help you with school that you don't know just go on the internet and look it up if you need to translate @CAPS8 to @CAPS9 just go on the computer and translate it. @PERCENT3 of people learned a dictionary there own using the internet. If there is a word you want to know and isn't i the dictionary look it up and it will be online. Computers have a positive effect on people. Nobody spends so much time on the computer that they can't go outside or hang out with there friends. People actually need the computer for their @CAPS1 the new technology that is coming out is letting people interact with people across the world. They are positve to have for school work, definitions and even translation. Computers are not negative and they dont take away what you should do in life.

Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, "I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport." Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, "I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money." People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, "@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees." @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society.

Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion they take time away from exercising. Also, no one has time to enjoy nature. Of course, when it comes to family and friends, The time is stified by the computer. If more people get of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I'm positive all would be resolved. I'm sure that the computer is affecting everyone negatively. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. One in five children are obese. I feel the computers is contributing to the problem. I remember times when I wanted to go outside and exercise, but the computer dragged me away wih all the fun games and videos the internet sure, the computers fine in moderation, but many people abuse their privellages. Obesity leads to many such as dogged arteries or strokes. No parents wants to see their go through young. But if from of to fix it? taking away for many. Everybody these dayrace people have so much effort making. I's sure I would have had across time if went people have probably done. Good times. Family to take time from away from us. In conclusion, I feel the computer is an addiction. Millions who on the computer gain weight. Also, it takes time enjoy nature but the computer blocking the way. Another thing the comuter puts family and friends on hold. Memories are being stolen by the awful device that computer. So else how bad the computer is.

@CAPS1 dinners ready okay mom, one second' click, click, click. Are you hearing this from your children than usual? Well if you are than you need to listen to this upcoming message. We the @ORGANIZATION1 believe are children and adults are spending too much time in their laptops or computers. They're not out exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with their family, these problems could lead to begger problems that @MONTH1 have already taken affect like: @CAPS2, financial problem and then to depression. So keep reading and think what you hear that could or has happened to you. @CAPS2 is a huge thing to worry about kids all over @LOCATION1 are on their computer than outside. Ever day I see my nephew on his computers I see him getting fatler and fatts every day. Studies have shown that children and adults that own as facebook or myspace account, they gaim about @NUM1 pounds every @NUM2 moths. If they're even on @NUM3 to @NUM2 hours a day they'll gain @NUM5 pounds every month. Sooner or later the state is going to have the @CAPS2 level from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people who are obesy. This could lead to loss @ORGANIZATION1 jobs laziness. When people spend most @ORGANIZATION1 their time on facebook and myspace than they could lose their job's. More than @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 the state citizens own a facebook or myspace. So when people are addicted to them they're spend more time on that thatn the steff the have to do for their jobs. So then they'll get firm one can't pay bills, loans, and mortage. This then will all tead to depression. Depression is all over the state even the country. People are losing jobs left and right cause their computers and internets. People are even comiting climer like murded and even attemps @ORGANIZATION1 suicide cause @ORGANIZATION1 loss @ORGANIZATION1 jobs or family members. Some people are even so addicted to the internets and girths @ORGANIZATION1 new born family member. This depression needs to stop. So fight for the right to stop the addiction @ORGANIZATION1 internet use and live a great life. Drop the computer sead as book, meet up with friends and family, keep your jobs. Don't let these reson come between you and your life."

@CAPS2 people think, the invention of computer, and the internet is a terrify thing, but truly @CAPS6 is terrible time consumer. The local newspaper is doing a survay about peoples opinion about technology.

My is people should go only on the computer if they really have to do something such as type a reports, check your e-mail etc. Whats the point of going on the computers if all your going to do is play games that gets boring to me. I go on the computer to to my friends and check email and stuff and then i go outside to play. You should only be on the computer for @NUM1 minutes a day then go get some exercise. If you stay on the computer all day you will smell, get fat, get lazy, and no one wents these things. These are the things you should have. You can play basketball, go on a bike ride, with some friends, go swimming, I do this type of stuff every day and I am in good shape because of it. I stay healthy and fit I dont sit on the computer all day on a sunny day. You become more if you go more it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids. When I get home every day I do my homework then I go outside and play, then later I go on the computer for @NUM1 minutes then @CAPS1 done and I go to bed and the same thing the next day. So everyone agree with me because you knew I am right.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, Some people say that computers are fun, smart, and do no harm. Is that true though? Do computers make harm? Well, for one thing, I know that computers can take up! a lot of peoples time. For example, many people don't go outside as much. This is because most people are usually on their computers. What are they doing on the computer you ask; well lets, find out. There are many things a person can do on a computer. It can be fun chatting, educational or hard working. A lot of people use a computer for fun. For example, many people use the computer to chat with their friends. There are many sites to chat with friends. That can usually take up a lot of peoples time. A lot people can talk for hours on the computer and that is what takes up their time instead of going outside. Another example is the games that people are playing.To me, the computer games are one of the biggest problems. This is because a lot of the games can be to much fun, that it can be find a game and play it all the time. This can not only take up their time outside, but it can ruin their life. The game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done. That can cause failure in school or getting fired at work. On the other side though, a lot of people use a computer for work and school. Beside internet chating and computer games, many people use computers for school and at work. People type their work up or they send work to their e-mail to bring home. This is a good thing about computers, but also a bad thing. It is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster. This is a bad thing because it is another reason to stay inside.For work, people depend on computers. They save work on their and they use computers to build things. For exemple, people use a computer to program a robot. Although they use computers for a good reason people should make time for outside. A lot of people need to take breaks off the computer: because computers can do harm. This is because if they spend all their time on the computer they can get sick. Going outside, exercizing and getting fresh air is very important. So people out there, get off your computer. Stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. Enjoy the nature. Most of your day should not be on the computer. Thank you for your time.

Dear local newspaper, I'm sure you love kicking back and surfing the web. Afterall, the internet is an amazing invention. However, the truth of the matter is that some people spend way to much time on the computer. We miss out on all the other important things in life, just because of to much time on our laptops. Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise. It can cause us to be anti-social, And lastly, not allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know that a very high cause of obesity is? Electronics, kids sit on the computer all day long, while they should be out exercising and keeping fit. Sure, it is still okay to surf the web. You just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home. I myself love to use the computer, but i make sure to get off after about an hour. The whole idea of the "internet" is such a broad topic. That leaves us with so much to explore, we just have to keep on eye on the clock. There are so many forms of chat on the internet; @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are always on one of those, instead of talking in person. We can eventually become anti-social due to so much time spent on the computer. Although yes, you can be talking over the internet, it is necessary to be talking to people face to face, it is as if we become grued to the computer. Websites such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are also causes of this. People get addicted and are on them constantly, @CAPS4 "@CAPS5" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So instead of having a chat over the computer screen, plan a meeting in person. Don't allow the computer to let you loose the social skills that you have built up. I love going outside each season to see the beautiful nature that surrounds us if you spend to much time on the computer, you wont have time to enjoy it. There are so many thing that you would be missing out on. Take time out of you day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside. Things outher are so much prettier than you computer screen, trust me. once you cut down you computer time littyle-by-little, you will realize all the other things that are more worth you time. So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game, i hope you think about my opinions i presented to you. Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise, and we can become anti-social. we won't be able to enjoy the nature around us. Computer time is fine in moderation, you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it. Hopefully, my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web.

Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are both a good and a bad thing. Computers allow use to play games, and learn about almost anything. But computers cannot simulate fresh air and exercise. Computers allow people to play a wide variety of games. People can play chess, solatire, and a great deal other games like that. Computers also allow us to play a very wide variaty of online games. I can think of at least three different sites that have online games. Each site having at least @NUM1 different games! Hundreds of thousands of people play online games everyday! What would they do if we didn't have the computer to play those games? We can also search any topic from a computer anywhere. This is a amazing thing to be able to do. Imagine if nobody had a computer how would we research so much of our knowledge? Yes there are but using a computer is so much more faster. Plus you can print thing out on a computer with a book you have to copy important down. But you can highlight the important. How much could ? No matter how much computer do they @MONTH1 be but it is kids getting bigger and bigger all because they long. Computers are amazing and society benefits from them by a lot. But just like everything computers have their downside. So please inform adults and kids about the goodness of computers, but also warn them about the bad things that could happen if you spend to much time on the computer and outside.

Computers can be addicting and cause us to play for hours. @CAPS5 people @CAPS4 not exercise at all anymore. Most are too busy on thier computer. You should have at least @NUM1 minutes of exercise each @CAPS4. "@CAPS1 kids sholud have anywhere from @NUM2 min of exercise on average per day. A lot of kids are now playing video games on the computers for that time instead of exercising," says @CAPS2. sereno. @CAPS5 kids don't go outside enough either. Did you know you should have a minimum of @NUM3 min in sunlight each day? You get most of your vitamins. the sun. When was the last time you took a bike, went camping, or went to the beach? All are very fun things to @CAPS4 that you could be missing out on learning of the computer. I know I absolutly love going to the beach. Hearing the waves, & laughing @CAPS3 ocean waters, and feeling it cool as the is just heaven. If I was on the computers all the I would be able to enjoy. My most thing @CAPS4 you like having fun or going out to your family? I @CAPS5 computer dont to are the same as being with the person. Can you imagine never actually seeing or hearing the person you're talking to? Thats now it is with @CAPS6. @PERCENT1 of communication on the billions of people who have @CAPS7't you rather talk to the person on the phone or talk face to face? I feel people should spend time exercising, going outdoors, and spending time with friends and family. Remember @NUM1 minutes of exercise, @NUM3 minutes in the sun each day to stay really healthy. Please consider this and write an article to improve the town's social & overall health. Its up to you!

Dear Local Newspaper, I have herd that some people do not agree that computer benefit our society. Well in this letter I am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society. Those reasons are @NUM1) People have friends and family in other states @NUM2) some people use them to stay organized And @NUM3) Computers help you learn more. I hope that by the end of this letter you will see that computers do benefit our society. First of all, I think that computers benefit our society because @CAPS7 lets people @CAPS3 in contract with family and friends in other states. This is true that you could use the phone and call them out you have to pay for long distance. You don't have to pay anything to email somebody. I know from experience because, I have friends and family in a lot of states in the @LOCATION1 "@CAPS1 computers help me stay in contact with my family all over" @PERSON3 ( @ORGANIZATION1 ) @CAPS2 many people use the computer the contact with loved ones everyday. Some people even on them to stay in touch with family or at war. Next I believe that computers benefit society because @CAPS7 keeps people organized.

Then there is face book, @CAPS7 lets you see what people are doing that day. "People learn everything to the computer" @CAPS9 @PERSON2. Now I hope you see that computers don't benefit our society than that is your opinion. I hope you see what I see now.

Dear @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention! They allow you to do so many different things. They have alot of positive effects on people. Computers deal with all sorts of things, from hand-eye cordination, learning about faraway places and people, to talking online with anyone. Come on in to the wonderful world of computers. Computers have a super positive effect on people. They help teach hand eye cordination. You can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse. You can see where it's going just by looking at the screen. Doing this helps everyday skills like playing sports. If you can use your eyes and your hands at a you can hit a baseball or even. Computers teach hand eye cordination by being able to do two things at. Would it be amazing if you could just find a recipe go to? Well, you You could simple A computer helps people different things. It's also easy different culture, people, and places. Let's say you @CAPS2 and you. A computer gives you any learn something. Computers and almost everyday. They give you @CAPS3 instance, @CAPS4 is a great way to talk to people. You can chat with people typing. Further sites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6 or @CAPS7 where you have you own page post your own opinions. You also have friends page to see how you are doing. These sites give people a chance to find with old friends. Webcam is becoming a huge sensation! Sites like or skype let you see and talk to the other person. They allow you to talk to people that you @MONTH1 and feel that they are there with you. Computers benefit people all over the world. but that doesnt. Computers help people physically by being able to learn new things, and with being able to computers arent taking over are only helping them.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a lot of technology including the biggest hit, the computer. I say that computers have a more positive effect on people. Some reasons include that computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even give you the ability to talk online with other people. Where would we be without computers? First of all, is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. People that type slower usually have poorer hand-eye coordination. Of course with faster typers, they have better hand-eye coordination. @PERCENT1 of people including teachers agree with this. Is this why @CAPS1 is typing "lessons" in computer classes in elementary school? The answer is most likely going to be a yes. Second of all, is that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. Computers give you more resources than a book. Using the computer to go on multiple websites, is actually easier. Using these websites, people can have a higher education. One teacher said, "using websites is so much easier for everyone. Using them for homework and having the students take notes is a lot less difficult." And to that I agree entirely. Finally, computers give people the ability to talk to other people online. Using things like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3-mail, and video chat. All of these, and more give you the opportunity to chat with friends living far away. That way friendships are never really lost. People never want to lose relationships. Losing one can be very sad. I know this from personal experience. In conclusion, this is why I think that computers are a positive effect on people. From learning to chatting, computers are a great way to chat with friends and even do homework. Hand-eye coordination included. All of these are positive effects don't you think? I think so and this is why I believe that computers are a more positive effect than a negative effect on people.

I believe that computers make everyday work easier to do. Computers allow someone from a faraway place to talk to another person who they can’t see in person, they allow you to get work done in a quicker manner. And get a college education without leaving your home. Imagine that you have a relative who lives a great deal of miles away from you and it’s too expensive to call or fly over there. Computers enable us to communicate with them through email or video chat without the hefty price. Because of computers, talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away. Getting work done can sometimes feel like another chore. Computers only make doing your work easier and faster. Would you rather sit and write out a term paper for hours or type it up and email to your in half the amount time college students find that computers get them efficiently than writing by hand. Computers are way to burdens of work. Education is an of all need, but what if the college that you want to attend is too far from home and you can’t afford to move in ? Thankfully, online college courses are available. If it wasn’t for this source of technology, you would be left to do what? Online courses allow an eager student to learn without breaking their bank or leaving their child if they are parents. Without computers, everyone would not be able to get the education that they have a right to. Computers have allowed us to communicate with our family that live somewhere we can’t afford to travel to. These technological devices have enabled to us to get our work done in a timely matter to receive the grade that we deserve. Computers have allowed over @NUM1 citizens to get their education right in their home at a price they can afford. Without this gadget, we could not be able to live the life we have @DATE1, a life that can get us to where need to be.

Dear @PERSON1, The use of computers is not beneficial to our society. I fear that many kids will suffer from child hood obeasity, this is because of the inactiveness of so many teenagers my age. They @CAPS1 could be enjoying life outdoors and staying active, but they choose to sit infront of a screen all day, everyday. Researchers have proven inactiveness is at large due to many, facebook, mysape and twitter users. These websites are nothing but trouble, other than being unhealthy, teenagers all over are being cyber bullied, to the verge of suicide. Many are not aware of the several pedifiles and creepos these sights carry, which can lead to abduction, rape or worse. By staying active and being outdoors with your friends could save you from these dangers. Go outside run a little, you would be amazed how much a little exercise can help you. Also I firmly believe time should be spent with your family, doing family activities and eating dinner with your parents. By doing this you become closer as a family, and it could help you make healthier choices keep exercise. I believe by following these simple steps, staying active, staying off the computer and spending time with the family. Is much more beneficial than learning how to type, or talking to your friends. Using the computer leads to cyber bulling, and dangerous people, living healthy is the way to be.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about computers? I know that I think they are a great to we are lucky to have them. They have to be used in moderation though, because exercise and staying healthy is good. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help pursude readers on my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers, is that it is a great source to learn. The internet can connect all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures. You can know everything about that country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about you family's history. Many record keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to @LOCATION1 they had data bases there that had every name of the people that went through there. Studies show that @NUM1 people find the internet easy to use, and quicker than any method. Another thing about computers is they help you in the work place. Lets say you had a job designing houses to be built. In old times you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you could make the design using just one tool, the computer. It is a much away way to to you job and if assists the customers because before if the wanted the house to be a different you would have help to draw it all over again. Now you just have to make an ajustment on the computer and in seconds its done with the new design. These day if not @PERCENT2 then @PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play in a social role. On the internet you can connect and chat with friends. Also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting with a soccerball. Experts did a study and it showed that @NUM2 times the reason a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. "@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer) what do you think the number one reaso teen use computers teen use computers is?" @CAPS3, I would have to say to chat with friends. I dont see why they wouldn't, it's simple and almost in ." Computers are, a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life, life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be over used though and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that. To me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer source found @PERCENT3 of in @LOCATION2, and. I believe they will be in all of our homes. Some families find them @CAPS2 useful the have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs, and can connect you to anything in the world.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Readers, Some of you might think people exercise computers. They don't act outside enough or interact with family or pets. You also @MONTH1 think that they are not getting enough exercise.Well you are right but I am going to explain way your wrong. You can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. The first thing you could do is learn. While you are on the internet you can go to learning websites. Some of thoes websites can teach you about faraway places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 for example, you could learn their culture and the @CAPS5 they celebrate and why. Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. Another thing you could do so the computer is socialize. You might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends. Well you can. There are websites like @CAPS6 and facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now you can webcam people. When you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam. Lastly you could go into chatrooms like @CAPS7 ( aol instant message ) and talk to people while you are on that sight. The last thing you can do is become more healthy. Is it not surprising? yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com car give you a might eating schedual right for your . After that website you could go out and get the you will need. Another thing that the computer offers is hand-eye coordination. While you are looking at the screen your had is controling the " mouse" while the, mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. Lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world. So now hopefully you agree with me that computers do acctually benift some things in life. I have showed you what you can learn about, talk to people and socialize and lastly help you with your health.

Computors have definitely had an impact on society that changed the world. People and life are now smarter quicker, faster, and easier. People who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant, for free. But what effect does this have on people? Something this big and having such a long history can't be good for some people. I don't think for some people it is. To start with basic, some people get too obsessed with computers. If they have life problems then they @MONTH1 seek the solitude and privacy of unfiltered and limitless internet. Even if you use a computer to chat with people, it still is no replacement for the real thing. In fact, studies show that due to non posonal ways of communicating such as text messaging, email, or chat rooms, can severely restrict a pasons way of connecting with other people. Don't get me wrong here. I do use sites such as facebook to talk to people. So, I'm not going to state that online talk is bad. I think it's a very good way of keeping in touch with people you can't talk to in real life. And, it's a good way to help friends and be there for them. It's done in moderation though. Getting information from the computer is very debatable. Some could say that the people being informed is a good thing, which I agree. Some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant. I also agree with that. I would also say knowing some things are good, but be careful of knowing too much. One once I find computers to be great in is originallity. In a world where we are raised to kill creativity, I find computers to be part artistic. In a way. It's personally helped me to discover what kind of music, drawings, creations, etc. that I like. I can also share what I've made so everyone can see it. Or listen to it. Or try it for themselves. In conclusion, I think computers are a great tool for use in moderation. Some people who are obsessed, it can be problematic. I think they are a great addition to society though.

Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in would floor. Surely, computers allow you @CAPS2 my cousin on the computer and @CAPS3 important to note that, on computers you can play games that can help you with your school-work. You can go on sites that you on your @CAPS4. Show you how your body works for @CAPS5, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are not boring. This a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didnt. The time is now! Just think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because no matter what, people will always have time for that.

Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. They aren’t communicating with any of their friends, and aren’t really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps. This would happen @CAPS5 we banned computers! Computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. My close friend @PERSON1 told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, and doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didn’t have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. This statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. Also a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didnt have computers, half of the world’s discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well. Children’s specialist @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports.” @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. Clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. Lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate everyday. We wouldn’t want to deny them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didn’t have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4 a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5 says that when people don’t have computers & can’t communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they don’t talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this. The same family as before is sitting in bright, sunny room their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys calls out, “hey, look at his “ and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they build hand eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now & learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!

The advancements of technology has developed so much that it has become comenly known to us as a normal house hold such as we use it every day at work, home, schools, bussneses it has become a comen used item in the everyday life. Emails, researching, questions on the world around us. It is required at almost every job application and at school and every thing in between. It's the - @DATE1 - complete age. Computers are and every day thing such as email how thats something that I dont worry about that and also there used to file a tax return. Also it is used to make reports up for people. Computers have also become a comen used thing such as school that we use them for reports, studies, and some home work. Also buiseness use it to comunicate with corprat @LOCATION1 uses a wide stance of technoligy they rec got a whole bunch of apples. Last. Computers are required at most jobs, and @CAPS1 going to list a few state, schools, military defence, jobs for on missles A and thier satlelite communication shut dwn on all comunications cell phones one those plaines that if it the twin towers nitro in atrack, tracking the truck where it gose and the rest I know about computers is classifieded. And this is why computers are needed in this society to use every day and thier comenly used and that are requirded.

Dear @CAPS1, Technology has made great improvements in the past years. Computers have now found a home in all most every buisness and home in @LOCATION1! Everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined and peole should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning? Name the fatest country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? The answer to all @ORGANIZATION1 those questions is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies done by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. @ORGANIZATION1 those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are over weight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function and helps burn off unnessecary calories. People most definately need to get off the computer and exercise more. They might even like it. Spending time with your family can be great fun, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. "@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school," @CAPS4 @PERSON2 beyond. So what's stopping them?, Computers. Kids now find many internet sites online online more interesting than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn @ORGANIZATION1 the computers, bring out the board games and keep @CAPS5 families together! "In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have," @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS6 wasting money on? You guessed it; computers. The average bill per month is @MONEY2. In a whole year your paying @MONEY1 for something you don't need! Computers also waste space. Along with needing a place to house your monitor, you have to find room to cram a printer, the hardrive AND all those wires. Who can find enough room?! I certainly can't. Although technology, namely computers, can be a wonderful thing, we need to look at the downside. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart and the economy collapses, all because @ORGANIZATION1 computers. We need to stop the problems and turn off the computers.

Dear Newspaper, I am writing to you @DATE1 because think computers really effect people in a bad way. I say this becuause @CAPS1 you go on the internet you do not get that much excirse. You also don't get good grades at all! That's bad thing. Plus when on a computer there are some really wierd people. I really want you guys to hear out my story. Go outside! @CAPS3 mom I'm on the computer! @CAPS1 your on the computer to much you want want to get exersce. @CAPS1 you don't get excise you won't be healthy! you want get excise. Also you will obese you don't want that! For instance when your in gym class you want to be healthy. So you can and you will get a good grade. Do you want a bad grades? That sums it up on. You got an @CAPS2! On your report card? When you spend alot of your time on a computer then you will get addicted. @CAPS1 you get addicted then you will not do your homework then your grades will drop. You will get bad grades in school. Then you have a possibilty to stay back. Plus then the parents to flipout on. This is one of my reasons why computers effect people in a bad way! When you go on the computer you have @CAPS3 clue who you are talking to unless your thier friends. There has been very many cases that kids getting stolen because of facebook and myspace. @CAPS1 your kid goes on those websites than your kids' always at danger! There are cyber and they could find out where you live that information about you. For instance there was a case on myspace that a kid thought she was talking to a @NUM1 year old boy she was really talking to a @NUM2 something year old guy. Then the girl went missing for about weeks. That was. So you can never trust a computer. When you take a real good look at computers you will see they are just @CAPS3 good. All my reasons before. They are you will not get nearly the amount of you are supose to. Your grade will plummet down @CAPS1 you stay on the computer and they trick you. So even know you can communicate with your friends. Its just not worth it.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not excersizing. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average familly had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average familly has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then, because people are almost always on the computer, rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technologie has hur t our nation, is that there is an immence lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the parents should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exeed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their-heads with nonesence. Now, computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull, but do children use them that way? The answer in no, and, "@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults", state @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations. If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer-drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health.
<START>

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society. @CAPS2 can have its positive effect on people, but too much of @CAPS2 isn't a good thing. This is why I want to tell everyone about negative effects of the computer on people. We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things. They can help with business, interacting with family and friends, and you could even just use @CAPS2 for entertainment. Some negative effects that some people don't know, or maybe just ignore, are things like they can keep you from exercising, exploring nature, and you could spend so much time on your computer, that you could get addicted. There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern. So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising. Maybe we could tell people that they can use their computers to contact people like friends and family to go out and make plans to exercise and have fun outside so theyre not stuck on the computer all day. We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places and people in the world, and so much more. They also have bad effects, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from people. And you shouldn't be outside all the time, for the whole day. So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day. This way, people get what they want, and they have some time off of @CAPS2, too. Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern. I hope I have persuaded you with my well-thought out thoughts and ideas. And hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society.

How does the computer effect people? @CAPS1 there are way's that computer's can be really bad and really good", they're good. Because people who dont like writing usually just have a computer to type on. But people rarely do that, parent's and kid's stay on the computer not caring about nothing else but the screen the kid's stay up all night knowing they have school they dont even do their homework. I have proof my freind's, research show's, my mother also agree's. I suggest that you will agree on my opinion'. @PERCENT1 of my freind's agree with me because they have been through this, and they would'nt wake up to go to school. Dr @PERSON1's of @ORGANIZATION1 researched how parent's hardly spend time with their family. For example father's they basically always on the computer either working or looking up stuff. My mom say's that when she was younger she loved the internent. She never wanted to get off: @CAPS1 i hope youv enjoyed my opinion', thank's for even taking this time to read it. Thank's again.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is your opinion on computers? Are they good or bad? Computers, have not been around that long but it is contrivertal wiether it has a positive or negative effect. True they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous. I believe computer are not a neccesity to people. Computers are uneeded because people spend way to much time on them, then we begin lack exercise, and they become hazardous to everyone. First, computers are not a neccesity because people send way to much time on them. Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour -and-a-half the computer will start to effect you in negative ways. For one your eyes will begin to hurt. If you stay on longer than that you will start to get a head-ach. Soon your head-ach wil turn so bad you cant bare it. It will pound and feel as if its on fire. This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and @CAPS2 your reading or seeing at the same time. Most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest. Sometimes you don't get off till they have a stomach-ach too. After they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process. This is why, computer are an obstruction to us. Next, people begin to lose exercise. After being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computer have deprived everyone of the outside. They don't want to go out and get exercise and play around. Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing, obysity. Soon you will become fat. Life will become tough. And being fat also has a negative effect. For one you cannot run very long, you become weak, and for kids you stop growing. But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So you see computers are a nucence to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the envirnment. There are @NUM1 billion people in the world. At anytime about @NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan. Now, have you ever thought were this heat goes. Well, it makes holes in the ozon layer and causes global warning. The ozon layer is the only thing keeping the sun's ultra-violent rays from scorting us. Now if everytime some turns on a computer @NUM3 of the ozon layer disapeared and @NUM2 billion people are on that would be @NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere. Now think about global warming. If the ozon layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the @CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise. The @CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth. Do you reall want that. Eventually we would drown and life would seece to exist. As you can see computer are a nucents. They hypnotize the young children and adults. They be helpful but more hazardous. Sometimes we don't even relize this. Computers are bad because people spent to much time on them, people lose exercise, and they are hazardous to us.

People often say that computers and technology are bad for you, but yet i think they have helped our society out very well. Computers help people through there trouble. Computers make our lives easier. By, when you buy things now there are computers adding and subtracting your amounts, They help people find out where to go, And last but not least they help friends and family stay in tuch with each other. With out computers we would have to wait in longer lines for what we want to buy. For instince stop & shop they have computers to check out people and the lines are already long enough. If we had no computers the lines would be even longer because then the people would have to add up the money by hand. Also with out computers you would not be able to weigh you good as fast as we do now in grosery stores we would have to hand weigh it. With out computer days at the grorsury stores would be very long. Without computers you would not have @CAPS1 and places online that give you directions. You would have to have use the bid maps driving to places. Those mapes could get lost wile you are driving. You can lose yout spot, And some times you @MONTH1 mark out the wrong spots on you map. With computers you can have @CAPS1, Online directions that can tell you the fastest and easest way to get to your place. Also with computers it saves papers on maps and we do not wast as much trees. Have you ever been in the situation were you want to go visit your family member out of state but you just dont have the money? well many people have and now insted of waisting (the money they dont have). They can video chat, talk, look at peoples pitchers and keep updated with them on the computer. You do not need to spend tons of money on it, it is all free, they are social networking sites. That people use to keep in tuch with family and friends. Those sites you have to use on. the computer so with out computers you would have to travel in a car waste money and the air with your car. In conclution i think computers have helped out society out very well!!!

Dear @CAPS1, I belive that computers benefits the people of today. The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had recived information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to comunicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remeber my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the . Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2-obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and excersising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they myt entertain themselves indeers. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privleges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormouse benifits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students whith school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside. I hope that this letter had convinced you of the benefits of computers.

Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers have been here for a while now and taking them away would be like forgetting all the progress we made in technology. Computers are everywhere in fact, seven out of ten families on my street own atleast one computer in their household. So why would we want to take them away? Computers are too useful. Computers are not only fun, but very resourceful. Anybody with a question faild easily hop on a computer, research it on google.com and find what they were looking for within minutes. I remember when I had a cut on my arm that looked weird, my mom was to heal a wound. She researched it and got how to the mark go away. The computer only benefits you in a way. Is most likely them youll be staying at in two weeks and realize they don't have a pool! Lastey, without computers we would have no communication with new or different people. Computers are great for communicating. People are able to comunicate through twitter, @CAPS2, and even youtube. The sites all help people make new friends online almost like pen pals on the internet. Also, if the majority of your family lived in @LOCATION1 and you were stuck in @CAPS3, you could easily talk to them through email or an instant messanger. Hopefully now you have a better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is. Maybe you could even make next @STATE1 about how resourceful, beneficial and social computers are!

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, The @NUM1's ware the beginning of a new age, computers had just come out and were mezmericing people with its intelet. But now more and more people think it’s a waste of time. I for do want think this within these lives you will see my opinion take shape for the following reasons it's an information high lets artists expand their craft and engenirs are now able to plan buildings and bridges on their @CAPS1 to the internet student's and people are of knowledge each day the internet is essenicial to people writting an essay in fact the super intendent of schools in @LOCATION1 has stated that over @PERCENT1 of students will use the internet to help them write an essay. We also don't have to go to the library any were to do research because we have a whole library of information at our house (the computer) another thing is that people are now able to communicate all over the world which will allow us to learn about other staight from the source. Artists are now able to do things were now a new art form of video games has out artists do you like to express yourself do! Music mixing has became my and it is over the will sometimes add additional and lapse other tracks it they don't have to use a typing machine any just jump on the computer type a keyboard. You can use spell check and edit undo instead of having to throw away idea that you didn't like. Artists have been by computers, And lastly are how able to plan out how a building or bridge might look, (which also with the video game making) @CAPS2 can make the house of their when you plan buildings and bridges on computer you can which makes them stronger, before you even start building them with the new soft ware available today how certain structural under natural disasters so they can pick the has the abillity of becoming have way. I hope you can see using way eyes and agree that computers are thely an amazing they that lets got information also help

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. "@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, "says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers do benefit society because computers can do alot of things like teach you. Computers are very helpful now, mostly every thing gets done on it. The computer teaches good eye cordination, how to focus, and show you stuff you don't know about. Without an computer you really can't get any thing done or reddy. A computer can be helpful for lots of things like job aplications of taxe's, or at a grocry store register, typeing and being on the computer is exercising but not for your body. When your on a computer exercise your hand's and your brains. With out computers you really cant do any thing. Mostly everything you do in life have to deal with some type of computer. I think that the people that said they shouldnt be on the computer is wrong because they can interact with there family that's far away thats also on the. You can enjoy nature by just takeing a look old you don't have to walkt out. Thats why I think computers are positive and helpful.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can. In conclusion is a very useful thing. talk to your relatives from @LOCATION2 and you can shopping without the waiting in line. The can talk to other the world.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, I would say that computers have negative effects on us. This is because we would get less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends. If your on the computer most of the time at home, how would you get your exercise? You wouldnt because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop. This is also a proble because this is how obeseity can occur from no exercies, and just sitting all day. Or people who have heart problems nad need exercise can worsen by being distracted by the computer. Being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature. Instead of going outside in the warm wheather, having fun people are staying home. This is not good because they should be out having fun, not on the computer all day. Missing time with family and frinds is unexeptable when your on the computer. This is because yar supposed to keep your family and friends company and not daze off on what your doing on the computer. Also you miss family gatherings or leave yar friends lonley. Thats because yar to busy on the camourar nad not paying attention to anyone arand you. This is why I think computers have a negative effect on people. This is because of less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends.

Dear Local newspaper, Technology is a ever evolving thing and more and more people are using it. With more people making use of computers, will be the more technology benefits our society. Through the use of computer people will be taught hand-eye coordination, be presented with the ability to become educated on distant places, and also allow people to talk online with other people. Through the use of computers people will be taught hand-eye coordination. A effective skill to learn would be hand-eye coordination, the benefits of this would be outstanding. Having great coordination would mean that person would exceed past anybody who do not use computers. Advanced coordination would mean that person would able to accomplish more things like fast typing. Finally better hand-eye coordination means that person will be more likely to obtain a job in a field that needs good coordination.

The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper just found out that there is a big arguement going on saying that computer are not benefiting society. The other side those who support advances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. Well the @ORGANIZATION1 had to choose a side and the side that they have chosen that computer have a positive affect on people. Yo know why we pick this side because are three reasons why computers are good. Like number one they teach people about far away places and people, @CAPS1 computers are a good sorce of entertainment, and last but not least @CAPS1 computers are good chat room. When @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are finished telling you why these three reason are good the peoples @CAPS1 computer will win this war! First reason is do you like wasting time walking though the library looking for places or @ORGANIZATION1 people. Well if you have a computer you do not have to deal with these all you have to do is go to sarch and put these person or place name and you will see that in less than a min you have information that will take hours to find in a library. I know this because it happen to me looking for a book that talks about the @CAPS2 caladers. I could not find I had to go on a computer for the information. Secound reason why because computers are a good sorce of entertainment. You know if you got bord and you have computer you can easily just go on it and play so many fun games like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, dragonwars, or any fun game that you can find on a computer. There are so many games to chosse from that you will never get borad. Third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family. Like are so many sites that you can chosse to talk to friend or family like @CAPS5, @CAPS6 or even @ORGANIZATION2. Also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family. So go on a computers and talk to your friend even that person a picture or something. My cunclision is I hope you take want I said to heart and chosse want the newspaper have as a dision.

Dear local newspaper I think that the effects that computers have on people are that some people become very adictive to them, because some people spend lot of time in the computer doing noting because they just spend their money buying things that they don't need. I also think that computers affect people in the way that they don't spend lot of time with their family. The effects that computers have on people is that some people can't stop using them even if they want. People become very adictive to computers because they spend almost all their time in there. People don't exercise no more because they spend all their time on the computer, shoping things that they don't need they just buy them because they like them. The effects that computers have on people are that some people just to be talking to their friend on myspace. His facebook and other websites that are not good for them. I think that the effects that computers have on people are that they take away people's time because some people spend lot of time on the computers, living their family's alone without spending time with them. Computers take away peoples time because they don't spend time exercising or playing out side with friends or brothers or go to a park to spend same time with their family or have a contact with family and invite some friends to come over to have some good time instead of being in the computer all day without doing nothing. Computer's take away time or love for your family and they make you spend the time that you don't have. The effect's that computers have on people are bad because people can't stop using them even if the wanted to because they are all ready adictive to them. People can't stop using them because in the computers you could do lot's of things like shoping talk to friends and visit websites that have very interesting things from other countries that are very beutiful but some people can't stop using them because they go to play games or because they are down loding music from websites that they don't have to. In conclusion i think that the effects that computers have on people are very bad because some people spend lot of time on them and they even spend the time that they don't have and the time they need. I also think that computers affect people because they don't spend time with their family sharing good things. The effects that computers also have are that people can't step using them because they are adictive to them.

Did you know that @PERCENT1 @LOCATION1 people use their computers extremely often? Not many people don't have a computer these days and sometimes it's hard to get away from it. I think most people can control themselves, though I believe that computers are very important and also have a positive effect on people. I use the computer to talk with friends and family, to help with my homework, and I am still active. I spend quite a bit @LOCATION1 time on the computer, yet I am still a very active person. I take dance lessons twice a week and when I can. I ride my bike, play outside, or run on the treedmill. I would say that I am a very healthy person. It @MONTH1 seem like I am on a lot, but really I have something. Also, all my friends are on the computer and some @LOCATION1 them are more active then me. Most people spend lots @LOCATION1 time on the computer and are still healthy and busy with other activities. I would definetly say that I interact with my family quite a bit. In a family @LOCATION1 it is kind @LOCATION1 hard not to. Also, I hang out with my friends every chance I get. I interact a lot but the computer lets me talk to them when there not around. Most @LOCATION1 my extended family lives in @LOCATION1. The computer lets me communicate with them and even exchange digital pictures. Sometimes your friends. This has happened to before and I were too busy to get together or it was snowing and my parents couldn't drive. We still got to talk and have a nice conversation. Some people have to be on the computer all day. my mom keeps the books and managers many things for a company. She spends a lot @LOCATION1 time on the computer whether she likes it or not. This really cannot be helped. Sometimes it is just necessary. Also, teachers use it to help them teach classes and prepare materials for it. As s result, I use it for homework. I @MONTH1 need to check my homework, research a topic, or use it for help. I think the computer is absolutely necessary and is a very irresplaceable piece @LOCATION1 technology. I'm sure you will now agree that computers are helpful, not harmful. As long as you get equal amounts @LOCATION1 fresh air and family interaction, they have a very positive on people's lives.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A recent survey said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors think the advances we have made with technology and computers is helping us rather than hurting us. I agree that computers are having a positive impact on us. Advances in technology are helping us become more efficiant. Computers also give us the ability to research places and things we @MONTH1 never get the opportunity to see in person. We are also able to talk online with other people who we might have not met otherwise. The most important, though, is our advances in technology. Recently on the news I saw a segment of how at @ORGANIZATION2 they are using robots to make surgery more efficient. This also means that there are smaller incisions being made, so that means a faster recovery. Another part of society that has been advancing is crime solving. Before there were computers, there was no blood testing, no fingerprinting, and most likely no x-rays. Computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish. Computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they @MONTH1 just have. Some people @MONTH1 never have the opportunity to go to places like @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with the computers it's almost like they have been there. Or maybe is in @CAPS1, but @CAPS1 isn't a very popular sport in @LOCATION2. And then they go on there computer and see that there is a ragby @LOCATION1. Then their problem is solved. When you go to a new country, you also get the opportunity to meet new people. But with computers and online sights like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or you can talk to virtually anyone in the world. I could be sitting in a chair at my home in @LOCATION2, and be having a conversation with someone across the country, or maybe even across the ocean! Or possibly you could be talking to some of your really close friends who live just across town. Either way, the computer is a convinient place to go and talk to someone. I believe that computers are doing us more good than their harm. Our advances in technology have helped us emensly with things like games and robotic surgery. They also give us the ability to search topics we want to know more about or a faraway place we've never been to. Finally, we are able to talk online with people that @MONTH1 just be across town or across the ocean. I hope that my reasoning helps you understand my point of view.

Dear @CAPS1, you sit down at the computer with a glass water and an afterschool snack, possibly an after work snack. You log on to your many accounts, open some chat boxes with your friends & start researching for your project. As more & more people log on to technology, they seem to come out with new things for computers. Some people are missing out, & dont see the negatives, like social relationships failing, procrastinatting, lack of learning & more! Beep! one new @CAPS2 message. On the computer you can talk to your friends & family, but sometimes people are on so much that in real life relationships fail. You cant type a @ORGANIZATION1 message or hide your feelings behind a screen. Also for kids when they get older, many jobs require customer service, and if you only are good at talking to people on the computer, it cant help you. Whatever you say on the internet can be read & posted anywhere, any site, any time, whereas in real life its really you talking. School are learning are very important too, but sometimes I know I have homework but procrastinate and say "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 do it later, i need to check this out!" putting my learning to a stop. Some people dont like school, but its very important in a persons life if you like to be successful, you need to balance school, learning, computer time, and dont forget exercise & possibly work! Computers can be helpful with research & guides, but facebook or twitter is going to slow you down. So buckle down start that research! Chatrooms, @ORGANIZATION2, email and other things can be harmful to you. There are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on. Its very dangerous, and someone can pretend to be someone there not. Also, computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome. There are many bad things that result from computers. Many times in your life youll need to find a balance. Dont overlook the negative or you could get hurt. Computers are nice to have, but be careful not to whittle away all of your time on it!

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you @DATE1 because of the concern of people that have computers. You are concerned about people whom own computers aren't spending time either excircising, enjoying nature, or not interacting with their family. I agree with the fact that @CAPS5 people have computers they become lazy and don't spend time interacting in any activities. I was in @CAPS1 one day and made a survay, for how many people agree that not many people because of computers aren't interacting in any activities. @PERCENT1 of the people I asked said they agree but of corse the others didn't care much. Many people @MONTH1 think it's normal but I checked a web site that specializes is weight and how to get to your feet and loose weight eazily, that web site is @CAPS3.com. I read an article on the web page and on paragraph @NUM1 sec. @NUM2 it states that the obesity in the @LOCATION1 is caused by either computer and/or lazyness. Of corse some people might disagree but at the same those people who disagree are big time athleats who do both. I had a chate with @PERSON1, a pro @CAPS4 player he said,"@CAPS5 I was a kid we didn't have those things we were either doing home work or playing outside with our friends. "Even big time athleats agree. Well in conclusion I agree with the fact that because of the fact that people have computers makes them lazy and do not interact with their family.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3't it about time we start thinking more about the digital age. Computers has contributed so much to society for many years and up to this point I don't believe the world would be able to function without it.Some people say that computers @CAPS3't good for society but do they really believe that computers gave us the internet, email, most jobs depend on the internet, even games, and many more let me explain. First of all without computers there would be no internet and without that many jobs would fail. Most jobs need the internet to work like architects need the computer to design buildings and houses. Almost every office has computers for many different reasons. Writers need the computers to wright books, if they were hand writen some people might not be able to read it, so if there was no computers thousands of people would loose their jobs. My mothers works on a computer she would loose her job. Not only that but we need computers for school. If I had to write a paper on a person it would be almost impossible to do without looking up information about him on the internet. Also with writing a paper, some teachers only exept typed papers. How are we suppost to do that if we didn't have computers that makes home work a lot easier. Lastly, computers lets us explore new places. Goole @LOCATION1 is a map of every place on @LOCATION1 that we can see. If you need to find out where something is you can always count on the internet. If you need direction you can print them out off the internet. Also if you need to find out what somthing means instead of using an dictionary use the computer. Now can you see how much the computer benefits society. Some people say that other people take too long on the computer but you don't have to. I don't know any one that uses the computer for more then work or school.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world. I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world because computers help everyone in their education. For example when i don't understand some words i go to the computer type www.dictionary.com. Then i words that i don't understand. After that the definition comes up and in a faster time because when i look in the dictonary i take about @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to just find a word but on the computer it takes me @NUM3 seconds. Also computers let us chat and send massages when we can't see or take to a person so we send massages and the receive the message them they send back a message. Lastly computers help on english class like on spelling, writing, typing, editing & revising. That's why i think we should keep computers in this world. I know everyone doesn't know everything. Computers could help us in math, by using formilas and a calculator on calculator.com. Also computers help in science, by going to @LOCATION1 and asking questions like, "what is matter or what are . Finally i am gonna talk about not understanding some words. I always go to dictonary.com so that website could give and help understand the word and get the real definition. I always use these @NUM2 websites when i am stuck in math or science or in english. Those websites could help a lot in our education. That's my way of thinking about the computers helping us in our education. My parents are always staked about me talking to my friends and hanging out with them. So, when i can see or talk to my friends i go myspace or facebook or msn to talk and send messages to my friends. We just keep chating and sending can messages because our parents don't let us hang out. Mostly everyone does the same. I do we could also send much other pictures, music and lot more. That's my opinion of why we should have comuters because we need to chat or send messages. At the end you know we all need to type our essays, lesson and more. The computers help use make power points they check our spelling, the could also change why we wright like cursive and more, they also help in editing & revising. I always keep sending words wrong. So the computer help me on spelling it also makes your project look better. That's why i think

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. First, computers are a great source to do school work on. Computers let you learn more information. In addition, computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society. My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with. An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assainnment to do that had to be typed. Its impossible to type an essay without a computer. Further more, if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and their is no time in your day to go to a library, the computer is a great source. Now doesn't that make sense? Computers don't just help you with homework, but many people go to college online also. My parents don't have enough money to afford me to go to college, "says @NUM1-year old @PERSON1," so I take free course online and they work great! "@CAPS1 it obvious that computers have a good effect on people? In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great place to look when you need information. For example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area. The computer is an great place to look at updated pictures, and learn about your new hometown. Sixty-nine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home. People @MONTH1 also want to learn basic information about bears or bees is my belief that the computer is a great source to do learn infromation obviously, computers have a great effect on people and it benefit society. Lastly, computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends. "I have my whole mom's side of the family living in @LOCATION1. When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them. I feel closer and part to keep in touch with them. i feel closer and part of one big happy family," @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2, says. People who have family living in other states, countries and even other countries, don't get to see eachother every day of the year @CAPS2 is why computers can help, the people keep in touch. Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days, weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them of ten. A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging. Therefore, i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society. to sum it all up, computers benefits society and have possitive effects on people. Computers are great sources to do school work, they give you information your looking for, and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends. Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and possitive effect on people and benefit the society. Thank you!

Dear local nepaper, I have reacently heard about the idea of computers are not very productive. Sure, people get informatin and talk online, but that can be a bad thing, I agree with computers being overcused and used for the wrong reason. To me, the main source of communication is chatting online. Even I talk online all the time. Chatting online is also a terrible thing if you abuse @CAPS1. Children aroung the world talk to people they hace never seen. People are being abroad because they believe the person they are taking to is the real deal, @CAPS1 is a great way to communicate just not in the wrong ways. Plagourism is happening all over the world, People just take whatever they want, when they did not create @CAPS1. We take if you are caught doing @CAPS1, you can go to prison. Although there is a way we van help the plagorism. the internet has all the information in the world, and people abuse @CAPS1. I have seen papers that have information that they copred and passed @CAPS1 to their paper. You can tell because @CAPS1 is a different for than the others, and bad things happen. Teachers immediately you have to talk to a supervisor about @CAPS1. I know I will try my best to not playorise, I can start by getting my own information. Everyone loves computer and technology, but if everyone can just lay off the computer for a while, things like plagorism and the abuse or online chatting can be limited.

I think @CAPS1's should use computer's so they can help their self's by using a computer? First @CAPS1's should use computers because if they wanted to take notes on what their doing they can just go on the computer and write it. The Computers are faster than just writing. On a computer all you have to do is type. You can use a computer to look up what ever you want to look for example: the teacher ask to look up a giraffe. The only place you can find a giraffe is if you go on the computer and search a giraffe. That's a reason how to look up things it is easier to look up things instead of looking it up the most way. Lastely, if you have a project you have to and it involves pictures and you dont know how to find it all you just to do is go on the computer find what you searching for and then we are done after you found everything that you see @CAPS2 to let students use computers insde classroom/schools for the they can get easy help.

Computers have been one of technoligy's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfall. Originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places, computers have been proven to do quick the contrary. Computers are dangerous devices, and are targeting young, wholesome kids. It is the main reason why society is today, predicting that this future generation is wobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation. These devices, the source of this mayhem, must immediately be removes from society because they take away the true benefits of life, have harmful effects on our health, and support some of the country's deadliest predators. Firstly, computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood. Since @DATE1, the amount of adolescent users has shot up @PERCENT1. Amazing ly enough, @PERCENT2 of parents polled admitted that their children spend at least @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. This takes away the pleasures or reading, exercising, spending time outside and hnging with friends and fmaily. These negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society, especially teenagers, the most frequent users. As a result diet and exercise are curtailed, raising the obesity number by @PERCENT3, and lock of ourdoor or family activities have promoted anti-social @CAPS1 this alarming rate out fufture generation @MONTH1 indeed be balancing on a cracked foundation. In addition to limiting diet and exercise, computers are also the source of yet another act. As long as the computers are plugged, they emit invisible wares of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are linked to diseases and cancers. Use of computers have to cause brain-tumors and leukemia, asw ell as brain disorder and cancers. Leukemia, when caused at a young age, is difficult to cuse and stants the child's development. Children exposed to at least @NUM2 hours a day to @ORGANIZATION1 compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are @NUM3 times as likely to develop such possibilities. The ultimate prevention to such risjs is to to the rest of such causes, computers and it completely. Lastly, computers are harmful because they also a deadly we open. As an adolescent unthinkingly says the web and chtrooms, they are at risk of atteck by thousands of children predators prowling the web. Computers contain extremely valuable and secret information, such as names, birthdates, genders and even social security numbers. With one click, acfepting a strongers inivte, the online predators hack into the child's computer and obation such valuable information. Or the predators @MONTH1 be less postive and attack directly-asking questions to the child themselves. In fact, a familiar story tells the unfortunate fare of one local @CAPS2 girl, who unknowingly chatted with an online stranger. This online predator smoothly invited her to the mall, where they moved. A couple devastating, weeks later, the girl's reamin in were found, burned, as the last deadly act the predator performed on the teen. Three for, computers are simply too dangerous, a predator's thumbbook as they search for their next victim. by removing the computer, you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well. It is amazing to learn that technology's greates advanvcement, the computer, can unleash such harmful effects. Lack of engaging activities such as exercising and reading are stunded by the ever distracting computer its electromagnetic radiation attacks our health and lastly, it supports the acts of the thousands of cruel, sneaky online predators awaiting your child on the web. By removing the source of all these troubles, those acts can be prevented and society @MONTH1 begin to the pain for reform.

A large amount of people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees this technology benefits society. I think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways. This very useful technology has a positive effect on people because, it allows people to send, receive, and research a vast variety of information easily. @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to get information and get it more quickly than reading a book about that specific topic. They say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker. My cousin and I were both given the same research paper to do. He used several books to get information on the topic and I used the computer. The project took me @NUM1 days to do, while it took him a whole week to complete. @PERSON1, computer programming expert, said, "Computers have made receiving information so much faster. I vehemently believe that everyone should own this device. Moreover, computers help with communication. There are many ways to keep in touch with people over the world, like email, chat rooms, and websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These websites are a great tool to keep in touch with family and friends or even fans. @PERSON2, lead singer of the band @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, said "@CAPS1 is a way to talk to the fans directly ad post updates about upcoming tours and albums. Not only isit great for bands but it is great for college students. My older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away. The computer can also help with business. Meeting can be done through @ORGANIZATION2 or a different webchat service. Emails are a great way to send information. @NUM2 of business meetings are held over the internet has benefited work ethics. Please heed my advice and use the internet and computer. It will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information.

Introduction @CAPS1 cingle computer in the world should have internet. Internet helps people in meany ways. Ancybody can do there homework on a computer. You can even talk to your friends on a computer send emails to anybody around the world or just play coms. Teacher use computers because its the easyest to find information that they might need. Students can use a computer to do a research paper for lets say history. You can find anything about anybody or anything on a computer that has internet on it. Theres also a cool thing that is found on some computers its called microsoft word. It lets you right anything you want and if you mess up a word you can fix it if you wanted to. Some school-s actuly suply there students with there one partiple computer. They can do there homework when evertime want and just send an emal to there teacher that homework on it. Computer have @MONTH1 mark information then any book in the world. Because computers have way more storage for more information. Also the cool thing about a computer is that there are websites that let you talk to your friends that live near you. But you dont have to actuly co to there houses you can put pictures or you on facebook or myspace or any other site. You also can play games on facebook, myspace or any thing els. Schools should use computers because its the best way to get the information that you need to do something. Like science, math, or history homework. Or even just for fun or to learn something new that you never knew before. You should agree with me because everything I rote down was true and almost the best wat to get pictures or any information. That you need to do something. Or even just to talk to a friend that you havent seen in awile.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect.

Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, computers are a wonderful tool and they bear many positive impacts on society first, computers have created numerous @CAPS2 forms of communication. Also, they have enable us to create a @CAPS2 age in research. In addition, computers have given us amazing @CAPS2 ways to entertain ourselves computers have a incredibly positive effetct on people. One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans, is that we have developed many @CAPS2 ways to communicate with people all over the world. First, one fantastic program such as @CAPS5 (instant messaging) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people any where in the world, and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face to face talking, second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we don't live in the same town, and I'm sure a similar experience has occured to you or someone you know. Finally, the popular program of facebook has changed communication forever. People can now see things go on in your info whereever want. Although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research. One example would be our phenomenon search engine, google. Google to almost everything with help people in finding schools now use computer resources such us @CAPS6 which allow in research to the fact that there is so much availbale on the. In addition, computers have created many opportunities for people to learn more because of the billions of web you in existance studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people have found a website conataining information relevant to their research that was than a book. Computer are the reason that research has contuined to thrive and @CAPS2 continue to be made. Finally, computers have established amazing @CAPS2 entertainment for people of all ages. First, video websited such as youtube have created a place for people to watch music videos and creative films just to enjoy themselves. If you can't get tickets to a concert you want going online to watch music videos by that person is a much cleaper alternative, second, jaming websites are a less expensive, but if you go online you can play similar games at no charge. Finally websites with appropriate funny stories posted on them are a fantastic way to get the laughter of a comic, without leaving your couch wouldn't you prefer to stay home, rather than going out when it isn't necessary? computers are an incredible way to achieve quick, un expensive entertaiment in todays economy. In conclusion, computers impact proper in many positive ways. they're established now forms of communication, research and entertainment that will forever change society. Therefore, I invite you to join me to demonstrate the icrredible strenght of computers.

Dear Newspaper, Have you ever stopped to think what modern day technology brought us? A great example is computers. Many people use this device to book vacation, talk and build relationship people and to discover new ideas the world have to make the disagree strongly. The hot sun glaring down at you just is killing you not to book a vacation to a tropical island! Many people go on vacation and what brought them here has when they sat and places. the computer looking at hotels and booking thou, This modern day technology has brought many humans to places they wanted to go. Over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1's have a chat account to talk with family and friends. The country of europe to the @LOCATION1 is over @NUM1 miles and every time you make a call it can lead to alot of big kills. Modern technology has outsmost the phones and is now using the computer to talk to far away friends and family. In the progress the computer has put over @NUM2 of single people and expressing the relationship. Many arguments have been lead to because of the disagreement. Many critic and saying not many people interact with family and friends. On the other hand the computer has that many people are connecting and communicating @CAPS2 they can set a plan to @CAPS3 many critics have people and spends the computer. Although this is true there should desicions that will improve the health of the human by limiting usage of them. Setting standards on computers can improve this problems and help exercising. In this case I strongly disagree with the critics and for my side of good uses. If they took them away not only will people files fall but everyone will be disorganized in the bong run. Lastly discovering places and websites teaches even the smartes guy or girl something new. After reading this if have proven that my @CAPS4 should be admired by many people.

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefits the society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and it teaches people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world throughout everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the @LOCATION1 has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school I know that from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study in a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer know that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That's because with all the and websites it will teach us hand-eye coordination with I'm just having fun. Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy to use it. That's ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, than nothing does. As I have shown, computers deffinitly do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because it gives people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand-eye coordination. In conclusion, computers have a strong effect on people today.

Click click, another information page opens up on your handy @LOCATION4 these trusty, smart, and easy to use divices are always a object to have. Although, people are now starting that these handy desktops are bad for your well-being oposing that people strongly think that we dont get enough exercise or outdoor activitys in. Well computers are such a great entertainment system also, have a vast information supplie, and even allow socialization with friends/ family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 payers are no match for the internet and it's great wide spread entertainment system. The computer has all of the faimly fun movies, itunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse. The internet is the obvious best reason for a faimly movie night. One of the greatest pro about the internet is the vividsorce of information. Google, wikipedia, or even dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the @DATE1. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun I would rather learn about a sunny beach of @CAPS2 or the great landscape of @LOCATION1. If your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the @CAPS3 is a sure easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in @LOCATION2 or germany. The answer is simple, skype, fiacebook, myspace and more are all available on your handy @CAPS3. Many sites have a no fee polocy so they cant charge them money for social living with friends. As a personal experience I could now talk to my cousins wqho live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 due to the great interaction site of facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that thier even there. Obviously internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends. I'm people will open thier eyes see the great uses of the computer.

Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps them learn about foreign places, it allows them to connect with family and friends that live far away, and it helps them with their jobs. Computers help people learn about foreign places. Before my uncle went to @LOCATION4, he wanted to learn about their culture. He went on the computer and researched @CAPS1 culture, so that he can be prepared. How would you feel if you went another country and knew nothing about it? What if you were to go to that country and do something that was disrespectful to their culture, but you didn't know because you didn't do research on it? I know I would feel bad. Now some people might say that you can read a book on that country, but not everyone has time to sit and read a book. Computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other. I think that's pretty positive. Don't you? People connect with each other through the computer. More than @PERCENT1 of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers. Nowadays there are social networking sites, like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away. When I moved to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2, I thought that I was never going to see my best friend again. But then, I got a @CAPS3 and found her on there. I was very estatic. We swapped numbers and addresses. Now everyday I talk to her on the computer. Also, the only way I talk to my aunty, who lives in @LOCATION3, is by the computer. I can't talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up. Another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their biological parents or siblings. It brings them together and helps them reconnect with each other. Computers help people with their job. Anybody who is a @CAPS6 of a company has a laptop. It helps them store data, files, and important information. Computers are essential to these people. Also, it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation. How would you feel if you owned a company and went on a vacation, but you couldn't keep track of it because you didn't have a computer. Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps learn about places, talk to their family, and keep track of their job.

Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, "I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate." Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, "@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community.

Dear local newspaper, I have recently saw that you think that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of excercising or hanging with their friends and family. Well I think the opposite of that opinion. People interact with people online if the want to. People can also learn new things. Plus computers help people make money. So read on to hear more. Most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow. @PERCENT1 of all people have either a facebook, a myspace, a skype, or all three. on any of those sites you interact with people. We can meet new people on the internet. Like people on the other side of the state or country. Also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town. Like for instance if there was a missing child we know the description, so we could help find him or her. Not only do people interact bu people can research useful information. For an example, one day I was told do a project on teen mothers. I went straight to the library I took some books out and whatever I couldn't find in the books. I went to the computer for. Also we can learn about faraway places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. My mom always says, "@CAPS1 your room or @CAPS2 going to give your stuff to people in need." @CAPS3 the first time she said that to me I went to the computer to see how other people were having to me. Some were good, nice, big houses but tyen others lived in boxes and trash cans. That changed me big time, I felt really had for those people. Lastly computers help people make money and support their family. @PERCENT2 of all people found out about their job on a computer. Theycan go to websites to find good safe jobs that makes good money. Plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home. Some people dont have the money for babysitters so have to watch their kids all day so have to work from home to make money. Finally people can apply for jobs or even community service online. My sister, @PERSON1, got her first job by going on the @CAPS4 museums website and applying right there on the computer. Therefore computers are good. I say this because people can interact with other people online, people can research useful information, and finally computers help people find jobs and make money. Do you use computers for any of these reasons?

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1's small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more conected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as uch as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one.
<START>

To whom this @MONTH1 concern: I heard that people are having a debate to tell whether computers benefit us or are bad for us. I think that computers are great. They allow us to talk with people all over the world. They give us the ability to learn about things. Lastly, they save us money. Aren't these all things benefit us? I think so. Please keep reading to hear more about why computers are good. First off, computers give us the ability to talk with people all over the world. A lot of my family lives in different @CAPS1, and thats how I talk to them is through the computer. If you move away from all your friends and family, wouldn't you want to still keep intouch with them? Well you could by chatting with them on the computer. To keep the ball rolling, computers give us the oppirtunity to learn about different things. If I go on "@CAPS2.com", I could type in anything I want, and get information about it. Or I get an answer to a question. Are you a parent that wants to know how their child is doing in school? You could go to their school website and check their grades in each class they have. To wrap it all up, computers save us money everyday. If you needed to look up information for a project without a computer, you would have to drive all the way to the library and buy a book. But with a computer, you could get information easy in the convienience of your own home. In conclusion, you could see that computers benefit us in many ways. Thay give us the ability to talk to friends and family all around the world. They give us the oppirtunity to look up information quick and easy. Lastly, they save us money everyday. Thank you for reading my letter, which I'm sure has persuaded you to think that computers are a good thing.

How would you like to got a "@CAPS1" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after-school? What if you were bored to death, and you couldn't watch t.v. or play games? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer: you can watch videos and play games, you can chat and talk to people, and you can even boost up your grade. I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @CAPS2, let's look at how a computer can change your life. Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. You are going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser. I remember @TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1 and @DATE1 I found out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school. "@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we talked about how that @CAPS7 posibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school. For example, how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can do. If you got bad grades (without computer), you will go to a bad college and have a bad job, however, if you got good grades(with computer), you will go to a good college and get a good job. Next, let's look at how you can chat or talk to people. You can have a mesaging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers. You can also communicate with people who has an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them. So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public. Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together. A computer can really the of your life. Lastly, let's look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored. Why you go youtube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting? "@CAPS10, I was done with homework and I didnt know what to do, so i online and spend only watching youtube videos, sometimes people like playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing tetris, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight's before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, can entertain you as well. As you can see, saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely non-sense. Computers can and make you. I honestly never seen someone on the computer for.
<START>

Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers do not effect people bacause I believe that they actually benefit people and the way people live computers do more than have games, In some cases help you gain knowledge computers can be used for entertainment, jobs, research, projects and more. Not just for games. Computers help peopel do their job. For example, if you work as a lawyer, you @MONTH1 need a computer to type your documents up. If you have bad pemanship and have a joblike a lawyer. You @MONTH1 need to refer to something in your document and can't read it, that's a problem. So in that case, that;s where the role of the comuter steps in. I also think that computers do not have effect on people because through garde schoo, sometimes kids need the internet. Some people don't have the option of a library of ther isn't one near them. By using the computer for inofrmation on a project or homework, I think it benefits, not effects. I have one more reason why I think computers benefit, not effect. I believe that if you have a @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, you have a chance to meet people from all over the world. Just by that, you could learn something you could learn their lifestyle and things about thier culture.Thank you for reading my letter, hopefully you will rethink your decision.

Due to an on going debattle about weither or not computers benefit society I am writing to you to inform you of my opinion on this mater. I believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back. I believe this because. First of all, computer bring about online communication. Also computers advance and enhance learning, had to mention that computers advance emloyment. As I mentioned, computers bring about online communications. Now after reading this there must be one side running thru your head define this well online communication, include social networkinjg sites litre facebook and twitter and not to forget my space. This also includes email and blogs and some chat sites. Okay enough of that But how do these things inventions iprove our lives. These inventions allow long distance communication bringing people "closer together." @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And thru facebook, my mother can speak with him any time she wishes and over from their relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 be very nessary @CAPS1 same. Also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication. Besides, I mentioned learinig. Computers can improve learning in a variety of ways. Computers improve learning because they speed the flow of information to the students can go to such places and a school websites to findout more on a particular occuring at the school. @CAPS1 example, I go on my school's website to retreve nightly homewrok assignments and read the next day's daily annocments. Teachers might post helpfel hints on homework and @MONTH1 a detailed explanation of the assignment. Also computers can improve learning by assiting with research projects @CAPS1 example a couple of weeks ago my health class was information car our illegal drug project. So with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 thingk that computers are helping our society, but I disagree. People who are sitting on the computer are not getting exercise or seeing beautiful nature. Do you want to get fat sitting next to a metal box? People are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important. People in your life. Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer. All of the cool, fit people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of the cool people and go outside and have yourself a ban looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals. You can do both of those with your friends and family while sitting on your computer you don't see them as much @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends and I bet you are one of them. Friends and family can also help you get through hard times without them whi knows wgere you would be in life. So do yourself a favor get off the computer, and go visit some really great people. Its now or neve to get off that computer or your family and friends are going to leave you and you are going to get fat on top of that. Do you want to be that person? You are also going to miss out on the beauty of nature. So go, go, go, have yourself some fun.
<START>

I have relized that there as been a disagreement about computers the positive and negative effects on people. It seems to me, in my opinion that computers have more of a negative affect on people than positive. I believe tat people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercizing, they don't spend quality time with family & friends and need to get fresh air and enjoy nature. Although computers are a great piece of techology, many don't get outside to enjoy the nature & fresh air because their computers are inside their homes. This is not good because when you go outside, it helps skin health from the sunlight & lets in fresh air for your lungs. In addition, a walk outside to enjoy nature wouldn't hurt either. It can relieve stress & can be relaxing. Furthermore, it is obvious when people are on the computer, they usually block out what their friends & family are saying to them. People can lose track of time & be on the computer for hours. Instead you should use this time to be with your friends and family. Being with your family can make your bond between each other stronger and you can get along with each other better. Also, having a nice family time is a good way to help be with your family. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 experts say that eating a family dinner can help a child's grades & prevent them from using drugs or dropout of high school or college. Finally, kids are more obese than us because they don't get enough excersize. At least @PERCENT1 or more kids are obese from recent studies. Due to this; this can lead to bone & joint issues, heart diseaase, lung problems, diabetes and athsma. These issues above are serious health problems if not treated. If kids excercize instead of being on a computer all day, the number of obese kids will drop drastically. Excersize can help kids' self esteem, and get them back in shape. They can either play sports or even take a walk or run. There are many different things you can do to excersize and its fun for kids. Unquestionably, there is definitely more reasons why there is a negative affect on kids/adults due to computers for the reasons above and more. Computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air. Likewise, they also prevent families & friends to spend time with each other and lastly, it isnt allowing kids to excersice which can lead to obesity.
<START>

I would agree because computers do help people with other things like vacations sights, jobs, presents and shoping. So many uses for the computer. But creators of the computer are worried that people are spending to much time on the computer. Mainly its about conserners and users, most of those people complain that their having no time with their family and friends. You never know if the users are looking up vacation trips for both friends and familys. The things that conserners dont get is that the computer can teach you alot of things, history, mathmatics, science experiments and many more. Computers are also used in schools to help students with their work, even teachers use the computer for grades. It is true about people not going outside geting some fresh air or even taking a walk in the park. They cant keep themselfs on the computer for like @NUM1 hours, its just crazy. So i would go with both sides. Its just better to enjoy life then just look up things that you dont really need to. You should only need to go on like paying bills, and furneture for your house. Thats why the computer was invented.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a world where the uneployment rate rises sinificgently, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just discapeared. I think computers are more benefical to society then some people relize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an acountend. Computer games and @CAPS2 help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teen how to become sucessful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now acess grades in a heartbeat. My computer helps me.

Dear Newspaper: I have just read your recsent article on a weather computers are helping, or recking society. I think it is helping because without the internet I can't learn how to do things such as clear a the proper way. This takes time to learn but out over internet I learned it quickly. If you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you. There are many other uses is you just can't find your family is counting on you. You can do two things, you can panic and let everyone down, you can go or the internet and save. But all I have wasn't to the real. The computer does effect how people exercise I know what you are. but you have. Clear enough. The internet does effect how you exercise. It's pros how to better and more affective ways to healthy. There is also cons; some of the con sinclude hot. All of these can lead to different things like going or. it isn't, its only a bad thing when your. In conclusion just do the right things and you will be healthier than ever.

Dear @PERSON1, I am on the side of computers. You @MONTH1 think I'm only saying that because I'm @NUM1 years old and it is basically what I do for fun. Computers do benefit society because they are fun, a source of communication, good for schooling and education, and for work. Computers are not just the @CAPS1 but also @CAPS6 procesor and @ORGANIZATION1 and everything like that. Computers provide games for everyone from ages @NUM2 to @NUM3. When it is raining outside your parents are at work and you are by yourself and have nothing to do, turn on the computer. Play a game. There are many fun websites made for everyone. Computers also provide an exellent source of communication. There are all different kinds of @CAPS2-mail. @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and many other sites are exellent for talking to friends. Not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via @CAPS5 or any of the others it is nice to chat. Computers provide an exellent source of education. If you are doing a history project and you need more information and pictures, log onto a computer and @ORGANIZATION3 it. At our school we have edline which tells us all of our homework assignments. It is extremly handy. Now they also have schooling tutors online. It is great. Computers are great for work. @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION5, and other @ORGANIZATION2 wear or other compnies. You can find your information and make something out of it. It is very, very useful for buisness workers. As you can see, computers have a lot of great uses. I think computers effect people in a positive way by helping them in positive ways. Computers allow fun, communication, educational purposes, and work uses. Computers are a good thing to have around, @CAPS7't you think?
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1, minute man, people are complaining. They are complaining about how computers interfer with their family and life. But it teaches adults and kids new things. Being on the computer is an exeperince. You can almost search anything on the computer. You can learn history or about the present time. Like one time I was searching (@CAPS1.com) on how to fix a playstation @NUM1 controller. I found out how to do it and it worked. While you are on the computer you can interact with friends, find out about the weather, and find out if you have any homework. The computer also teaches you how to do different stuff. Like this one time I learned to do a hardflip. Also computer's can help you with your homework. Like if you have science homework and you're trying to figure a word out you can search it. Or if you're looking for a book for @LOCATION2 you can search websites for good books or ask a friend. The computer helps many different people in many different ways. And you know how people say computers are bad. If you have a t.v. for game system its like having a computer, right? But don't go kill your self looking for a cheap one. But I do suggest that everyone should have a computer, they are helpful and fun.
<START>

Almost everyone in the @LOCATION1 uses a computers at one point in their life. Computers are a way to teach hand eye coordination through programs, games and typing. The internet can be used for researching different far away cultures, as well as someone's own lifestyle. This compact well made piece of technology has been belaming more and more intricate. Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will be the down fall or support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand-eye coordination. Since the time children are in grade school, they learn typing on a keyboard. Special programs help kids learn the necesary skill while enjoying the practice. When I was small, a mere fight years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to barnes and noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed "type to learn" and @CAPS1 typing lessons as well as teaching children to type is general, teaches hand-eye coordination in high school, college, and the job world. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resemes, and applications. In this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand-eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, bejewled or car racing teach the skill and much more advanced games for example, world of war craft need perfect coordination can be through typing and games, both on the computer. Though some experts are conserned "people are spending too much time on the computer and less time..enjoying nature," you are able to learn about geography, travel, and nature. One amazing on a computer is the world wide web. This consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and information arte you in an upcoming geography uses? Are you planning a trip the for you do you need to find a definition for the word "cognitive"? of @CAPS1 pertain to you, a legitamite website house your and all you need to do is search. Instead of having to travel to learn about special wonders, for travel prices are expensive and you can simply, click and type to and amazing at your searching on a computer, you can learn about long ago cultures and rituals. Information you would find at museum @NUM1 years ago. @CAPS1 complex simple to use technological a world of pictures simple, art and history right at your fingertips.
<START>

Did you know that four out of five households have a computer? But why so many? It's because computers have a positive effect on people, Have you ever thought why? With computers you can contact people in different parts of the @CAPS1. You can search up different information over the internet. Computers also benifit other electronic inventions. What do @LOCATION5, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION6 and @LOCATION7 all have in common? you can contact the people there with computers! while talking to people around the @CAPS1, you can learn something about a culture or lifestyle that you didn't know before. You just might make a new friend along the way. Picture if you will, a hard working business man who lives in the @LOCATION1. He works for a @CAPS1 - famous company and has to go to a meeting with the big boss is @LOCATION4. Wouldn't it just be easier to set up a video chat? That way, there's no hassle with a plane voyage and it's much easier. Why do you think it's called the @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3? Over the internet, you can search up unlimited amounts of information. Animals, sports, a report to do on @LOCATION3, where do you go to find easy-to-read information instantly? Search him up on @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You never what might find out. There are new additions daily. With no computers, how would you download music to an @NUM1? You can't, you have to use a computer. Computers benifit a lot of other electronic equipment. You can download videos, print out photographs and charge @CAPS4 and other electronics. Technology these days is empressive. It gave birth to the much-used computer. Computers have a large positive effect on our lifestyle. Contact with otehrs around the @CAPS1 is now easier than ever. Information can be found instantly. And with computers, other electronics can work as well.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you believe people spend way to much that on computers? In a survey @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 of people rather go on the computer then take a walk in as parts. People who spend a lot of time on computers are lacking important things. For istance, they spend so much time on computer they have lose time to exerise, enjoy natue, and interact with friends and family. Computers have a negative effect on people. Many people don't excerise for only @NUM2 min. But when you are distracted on your computer aming or facebooking you forget to excrise or just go it for @NUM3 min. Because you want to get back to the computer. Computers on your desk starring at you and you sampled to go on. While, the yoga mat or weights sit on ground sterring at you too. However, the computers is mak fun and less woris. Therefore, your more willing to go on computer then excrise. Computers make it hand to excrise because your less into thinking how to this right and take you the because your thinking about a computer game, you played facebook, email and bunch more things on computer. So computers are unhealthy for people to have. Nature is beatiful, how the trees sway in the and butterflies fly in the air then there are all type of seasons with beatiful senery and. However there re stuffy room with sholves a desk and some picture that's the serey the people got when @MONTH1 are on the computer all the time. People are missing out on enjoying nature little and big beatities. People comuter aren't walking on beach on taking a nice long hike in woods dad not taking a stroll in a ark these are missing out on getting some fresh air and seeing the senery nature has to offer us. Instead they are sitting chair starring at a computer screen. However, pretty could that be compared to enjoying nature beatity? Computers are testing away people enjoying nature. Hanging-out with friends are family is a fun thing to @CAPS1 but how are you suppose to long out with them if your to the computer? They aren't going to internet with their friends or family. This could affect their future they could grow up sad and lonely aren't know how to act around people they get job their works around people. The people who are addicted to computer are missing out an doing something fun with some they lose or enjoy to be around. Computers could be people far away friends but how about instead call that friend on. They probably rather hear wire then. See a message so computers interesting with friends and family. Now, that you know how had the computers affect people you can understand why I'm computers. They cut in the peoples the excrise, and have people not enjoying nature. people want hang out with friends and famlies. So hopefully you can see what a bad affect computers have.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you like a place where you can control what you @CAPS1 and where you go? I know I @CAPS1. Well, if you afree with me then the computer is your cup of tea I think that computers have a positive effect on society. I think this for @NUM1 main reasons @CAPS2 with others, getting constant updates on whats going on, and a learning tool make up only some of the fasinating aspects the computer has. So read on I know you will think the same way as me about computers given my knowledge below. The computer captures over @NUM2 million humans attention with online social networks facebook, myspace, and @CAPS3 are the main attractions. In all of these websites you can keep up with whats going on with your friends and whats new around the world. These online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure. All these websites provide the information that people want and keep nthem logging back on everyday. I think these websites are great and can only improve society. This is my first benefit of a computer. Another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society. Many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show. They provide pictures, stories, and actual videos of whats happening right now. The computer helps us americans know what is happening in @LOCATION1 and lets @LOCATION1 know whats happening in the @LOCATION1 and the @CAPS4.S arn't the only ones trough The computers provides international news and gossip for everyone. Here is another reason why the computer is great for society. There are many things that us kids don't know and if we need some deep information we search it on the computer. The computer provides websites giving information on every time you could think of. For example, if I were to be stuck on some science homework I could probably type in my question on ask.com and get a great answer. Parents and teachers want their kids to suceed and the computer defenitly helps. In conclusion, I have given you @NUM1 great, well thought out reasons why the computer benefits society. @CAPS2 with others, updates worldwide and information on school all are in a great piece of technology called the computer. I hope you will trust me that the computer has a positive effect on society.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I think that computers defenetly help our society for many reasons. For example we can talk to friends on line. Not only that but then you can learn alot more about the paces you want to visit. Its also tru that you can gain more hand eye cordanation with those nifty devises. Read on to find out how you can talk to friends on the computer. You can talk friends on the computer by one of the most comon website facebook. @NUM1 people use facebook, thats @PERCENT1! Not only that but you can also meet new friends on the computer by talking about games or popular @CAPS1.V. shows. Wouldn'@CAPS1 it be nice to meet up with all of you old friends from school that you don'@CAPS1 ever see. My mom always says that that is how she stays close to her friends and that is the same with me. Do you want to learn about the far away places without breaking the bank? If you do then you should deffinetly search for some nice websites that explain culture and other details about other parts of the world. It's also true that you can learn a quick history lesson on some webpages. What if you are going on a trip but you don'@CAPS1 know were to then you could use the beloved internet. Read on to find out how the internet helps gain hand eye cordanation. You can gain hand eye cordanation by using the computer so many ways. For example you can practice typing up essays and other work projects. @PERCENT2 of people that have compters type faster than they write. Thats almost everyone. Not only that but don'@CAPS1 you think typing is faster than writing? Also you see the words that you are typing and you press with you hands. Thank you for reading my essay on why computers are benefiting our society. Just remembe we learn more every day from the computers. Also you can talk to friend. Lastly you can plan your trip. 
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, The computers that are being used, do have a positive effect on people. For example, there's better communication with friends and family, you get instant news on any topic, and you get advanced education. Imagine if no important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries the person no contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a facebook, or other interacting werbsites, you know what's going on in your friends life all the time without having the to by reaching them all the to see how they are doing. Every adult watching the news at night before they go to bed to see what has @CAPS2, what if you went to bed early. How would you know what happened? That's when you would go online and check what you missed, you could've missed out on what happened in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, or missed out on the wars to the @LOCATION1, or even tragedies that happened right near you. Not only will you have better communication and the news at the top of your fingers, but you will also have advanced education. If a student is doing a science project, but the work doesn't contain all the information the can The internet is a way to expands education. Also, there are and various more. Therefor, computers do have a positive effect on people you can stay communicated, updated with the latest news and have an advance education

Dear local news paper, This paper is going to be about the reason computers are bad. Frist, computers are bad cause people wouldn't have time to enjoy the nature when its nice and warm out. Second reason is cause they won't spend time with there familys at all or there friends and the only time they would get off the computer is to pay the bill and buy a game for the computer. The third reason is that how are going to get a job cause they wouldn't want to get up to look for a job cause there having to much fun intill they cut off the light then he would do dum things to pay is bell se he can start to play again and thats going to make hin do it over and over again. That's why it's bad to have a computer. But now where is people going go in life cause some people love to play games on the computer and some don't that's why some computers are bad for some people. And this is just my opinion there's alot more people might think so to. And thank you for having time to read this.
<START>

The reason why I think computers are good is because people like to do their work, or children likes the games on the computers. The second reasons is that adults likes to do their jobs online. Finally people who have computers are probably happy because computers is a good thing to have because you can do everything on it. My opinion is that computers are good for people because you can do everything like play game, go on myspace, facebook, twiter and alot of other websites.
<START>

It is my opinion that computers are not completly bad for people, computers can also be good for people. For example computer allow people to communicate in seconds. From around the well, and computers open up new information to anyone. But a major advantage is that people spent so much time on the computer, that they don't get any exercise. Firstly, computers are good thing because they allow news and infirmation to get to the whole world in seconds. Very recently during the war in the @LOCATION1, news reporters were not allowed into towns and cities where a user uses being fought. Every day social messaging sites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 brought news to the world through cell phone videos and pictures that wouldn't have been seen by the world had it not been for computers and the internet. Secondly, computers allow people to gain knowledge in a matter of minutes on topic the sun. For example if you need information on the country in the you can finf it with a computer. If you need a recepie for an @CAPS3 desert look it up with a computer. If you would like to know what the weather will be like, you can look it up with a computer. With a computer the knowledge of the world can be found by anyone. Lastly, the leading argument against is the people don't get enough exercise because they are always on the computer. The people computers say that people will because a thier computer that will the lives these arguments can be the overwhelming of heavy computer users do get enough exercise A recent status that among the internet average grade of A or better, who also do at least With this information the argument In conclusion, computers are not completly good or completly bad for society. Their strong points are communication and the ability to gain knowledge quickly. The main downside is that a minority of computer user don't get enough exercise. It is my opinion that computers are good for and the pres definitily outway the care.

Dear Local Newspaper, I am awair that more people use computers everyday. I think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them. Computers gives information about the latest and most recient things that happen in other towns contries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn'@CAPS1 see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn'@CAPS1 find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldnt want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you correct with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That @MONTH1 not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friend close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people @MONTH1 dislike them but they have good reasons why. More family time can be but I think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising. Well my time is up here. Hope you liked what I said here and you'll have a passion for computers.
<START>

I blive that computers have a lot of effects on people for example there eyes, there body, there mind. First you eyes if you set next to the computer too close you eyes gets effected by the computer screen and you @MONTH1 lose your eyes and then you woudnt be able to see or read or do alot of fun staff like playing as you want to set near the computer or not. Second your body if you set on the computer for a whole day and not exersice you will get fat in other word you body will become fat and you will not be able to ran and do a lot of stuff and so are you just set on the computer for the whole day or not. Thrid is you if you watch on you computer like a video or play a new game and you mind if only thinking about doing that and then when you go to school you will only be think about that and you will forget every thing you wanted to do at you thinkin about because of that. Fanilly I am telling every on to not spened too much time on the computer and be exersing and fun act side are working on you school work and doing homework and exersice and I want everyone to have a good life.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathmatics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other contantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors. Computers also have some more "practical" uses. They make it easier to see their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Lets say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away. You would halfway have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home. There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the raln forest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever changing sands of the sahara desert. You could learn about the greeks, archemedes, ancien egypt, or pacman, with a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together. So think, are computers really harmful?
<START>

My oponion is computers should be used for many different purpuses. One reason is chating online with friends and family. Another reason is that if you are going far away and you know someone that can give you directions to where you are going then you can chat with them as they give you directions to where them as they give you directions to where your heading. Another reason is if you have family that does not live with you and you can't go an see them then you can chat with them. Another rwson is that of your going somewhere and you don't know the weather for the next day then you can go online and find out what's the weather for that day. Also if people really want to exercise then they can go on there computer and go to youtube and od exercise from there computer. Also if you want to see the @CAPS1 then you can search it on your computer to see what's going on. Lastly if you don't think it's rite for people to have computers then you should try to get one to see how much stuff you can do with it. You will be amazed. This is my reason why people should have computers to enjoy while chating, watching @CAPS1 and many other stuff that you can't probably imagine. Also, maybe kids should not have computers but they can get one when they get older. Also, if kids need to search from school then they can also do that there are many reasons why people should get computers. That my my opinion about why people should have computers.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.
<START>

Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would wont computors because it benifits our society. It helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on. For example if you wanted to no about it's sports, you can just type in name. Also a computer can help you with your education. If you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. It is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. It is also a good way to communicate with you friends. For example, facebook, @CAPS3, twitter, and email one all good sources of communication. Also it is good for if you have a xbox or a @NUM1 you need a computer you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. It's good to have computors in school. Is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. It is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it. I hope these one all good reason to have computer in our society, and it will benifit us in a number a differnt ways
<START>

More people tend to use computer's more than going outside enjoying the weather, and I think people should less time on the computer and more time interacting with whom ever. People spend most of their time talking to people on any websites/playing online games. I think that it's a bad habit, people of all ages spend their time doing that when they can do something fun, but chose not to. Parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous. There has been many people who have been hired. Raped in websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many other dangerous websites. In be more I would say that children and adults talk to strangers and think they know that personso well, meet them some place and get killed or anything because many people lie they age. And who know that person can be a fiftey year old woman or man. Say their a teen and end up finding you That is why parents should not be let their children be on period of time and should be on. While you reading this I hope you understand why it's rong and take my suggestion under and help us young kids to (thank you)

To: @CAPS1 this letter concerns, Computers are apart of our daily life. You can do many things on them such as play games, watch videos, search the web, and even communicate with people from all over the world. They are very useful for people who go to school bacause you can complete and save work for your classes. Sure maybe some people are addicted to the computer but others use it only when they need to. Computers have a massive affect on some peoples life. Sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but informative in many ways. One of the informative ways is that you learn new information every time you log on. That is why I think the computer has a great effect on people.
<START>

Over @PERCENT1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 owns at least one computer in their house. Computers benefit society because they help the earth, and are a fast way to spread important information. Also you can talk with friends and family on computers. We have been told that some people think were spending too much time on the computer. Yes, but we need these machines to survive. News @CAPS1 took a pull and said "more than half of @LOCATION1 schools are now using computers to put homework on to save paper". @CAPS3 we start useing computers to do things that we ushelly use paper for we would be saving millions of trees. For example you can send an email insted of snail mail, the mail would go faster and save paper! People who care about the earth make websites on the computer to inform people how to @CAPS2 just to see each otherthey could mail and talk all they want. Also @CAPS3 you like to use cellphone alot the waves kill apoximately @NUM1 bees a year. @CAPS3 you chatted with your freinds it would save bees lives. The first snow day we my parents forgot to check the schools website and I was out in snow @CAPS3 we didn't computers this would happen to every little students an snow @NUM2 @CAPS3 there was a storm and you. I'v went out the is another place you can check' to get the weather and keep your family safe. @CAPS3 there was a hurricane and the power like birthdays and weddings your computer has a calendar on it that tells you wherever you write something on it. @ORGANIZATION1 citizens spend over @MONEY1 a year on phone bills. You can talk to freinds and family on the computer and save thousands. When parents don't have phones they rely on computers to comunicate with people. Have your kinds ever had a freind who for away and your kinds spend hours to them? Well they can talk and see each other while on video chat and it will feel like still here. Its now or never citizens of newtown! You know computers, help the earth there a fast way to spend information, and they let you talk and see your freinds online. So get up and write our local news paper telling them why computers benefit our society.

Dear local newspaper, did you know that just about @PERCENT1 of the people in the @LOCATION1 have computers and use them daily. I am one of those people and I don't get how people ar saying that computers are destroying our country, yeah I know that we spend a little less time with family and friends but computers help as help monitor weather and natrual disasters like torndos and hurricans, they give us a chance to see far away places and learn more about the world and we can talk with other people. Computers are way important in our world because we can monitor natrual @CAPS1 such as tornados, hurricancs, and earthquakes without this technology over @PERCENT2 more people will die from these @CAPS1 without computers because the will less or no warning about the situation. Over @PERCENT3 of kids in the @CAPS2.S go to school and with computers the kids get a better chance to learn absent the world and society. Kids should know what is going on in the world, or you could be a adult just browsing the web loking for information. My point is tons of people all around the world computers to learn. My last reason is to teach kids to type and to have hand eye cordination when kids get older and when we get @CAPS3 they are gonna need to learn how to type. So odds are if you don't know how to type you won't get very far but there in the real world. To conclude my statement im gonna go over my three reasons why we need computers first to track natrual disasters. Second to leern about far away places, and our society. Third to teach childeren hand eye cordination and to to type so they can get @CAPS3. This is why the @CAPS2.S realy needs computers.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I understand that more and more people use computers, and that can have a good side and a bad one. Do you go on the computer for hours every day? That could be bad. I believe computers are good thing, but only if they are used properly. Hopefully when I'm done, you'll see where I'm coming from on this matters. Everyone is on the computer these days. The problem is, many people are on way too much. They say they are working on hand-eye coordination, but in reality they are wasting away their lives on a chair. They do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big, happy family. They say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and viruses. Bad people are out there, and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day. Things like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you. Yes, being on the computer definitely has a bad side. But there is a good side as well. That is, as long as you are not on too much. It does improve hand-eye coordination, if you play the right games. And it can teach you things, too. Many websites have true information about place or things so you don't need to see it to know about it. You can be helpful. It is also an easy way to purchase items. You can just order them. Most importantly, you can have fun. So, what is your side on this argument? Do you think way too many people are on the computer. Or do you think computers can be great, as long as you're careful? I, for one, pick the latter one. What about you?
<START>

Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or whatever you talk to your friends are. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be much interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but thats not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there, but then what would be the fun of that. For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, dont you feel great when your going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful I am thankful to god of giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, georgus. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else or even riding your @CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but beacuse of the computer they got that wich really stinks. Now as you can you see computers really can change your life. So that's your discision. Pick wrong from right, all up to YOU. Now make it.

I think that computers are very valueable and help a lot of people I think that computers should be used for information that could help students with their homework or to study for a test and also for adults to look up things such as directions, adresses, and prices of clothes and other items. They are also good because they help you communicate with friends and help people make plans to do with friends. However some people should limit themselves on things like facebook and twitter, some people spend too much time on those things and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes a day on those sites. One of the reasons I think computers are good is because some students might not now the answer to something on their homework and could use the computer to find out the answers. Another reason why computer can be very valueable to all students is because lets say a student has a quiz on mitusis and cells in science the next day and doesnt really understand it they could use the computer to learn about it and do good on their quiz. Another reason that computer are good for people is because it helps them communicate with theri friends. Some kids are only and arent that gool at interacting with people in person. But these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends. however like I said earlier some poepleget carried away and spend too much time doing this kind of stoffs and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes per day on these social networking sites. Some people use their computers for other important things like buying things and getting directions and adresses. If somebody want to go to a store in a different town but didnt know where it was they could up the address an dthen find the directions to that place some people also use the computer to purchase things like groceriess and clothes. Sometimes people save money because they buy something online a sale than going to a store and paying anymore money. As you can see the computer has a lot of positives. Therefore I encourage you to support computers, because they are so useful and valuable.

Dear local newspaper, In my opinion I feel like to many people spend to much time on the @ORGANIZATION1. People are getting obeast because there not getting enoff exersoce. Children are going on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of doing there homework. Maybe perhaps a fmaily member is dieing and you rather spend time on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of with that family member. all of this things are happening because of the computers everyone is getting. This can not be true! That over @PERCENT1 of the people inNew @CAPS1 say that they are putting on a lot of waight and turning obeast. I asked them what do they think is this to happen. Someone named @PERSON1 said the reason is the computers there taking over people lifes. The computers is the enomy of the people that it is a affecting most in life. Me as a child a @ORGANIZATION1 is throwing me off of my homework. I use to have A's and b's on my report card only. Right now it turned in to @CAPS2 and @ORGANIZATION1's are changing my life drastikly but not in a good way. As you know it your child could be going threw, the same terible things as me. You should start to check there homework instead of them just going on there @ORGANIZATION1 and forgetting all about there work life I did. Try and provent this. running down your face and feeling disaponted in your self. The one you love good past u way and you did not even spend time with he or she. Wanse again the thing that is called @ORGANIZATION1 did this. The disigen that you made because of the @ORGANIZATION1 would and is going to scare you for life. We the people that have computers would find out that they were never made for a good purpose just to distray what we do and how we spend times with are familys and friends. Turn your head and say no to the one thing that would reck you into little peases. How do you feel? I feel bad because I let something so little mess up my life. You still have time to change your life and say no to the computers. They could make you turn obeast because you are not getting enoff exersice. The one you love could be messing up because of the @ORGANIZATION1 that you have in your house. The worst thing of all you were not able to spend time with the family member that you love the most. The computers that we have are missing your life us you no it up. Just say no to the computers and live your life the best way that you could. Don't you feel bad that you let something so little ruen your live!?!

Dear local newspaper, The effects Computers have on people is that people realie on them and thats not good because they have less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First of all, having less time exercising is not good because @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people ent up fighting obesscicley. "You don't want to be one of those people trust me" said @PERSON1. Second, enjoying nature is a good thing to do instead of playing with a computer because you get your daily dose of air by enjoying nature. "You also have a lot of fun" said @LOCATION1. Lastly, interacting with family and friends is fun and who doesn't love that. "Spending time with the family is fun cause you get to go places," said @PERSON3. "Who doesn't love going out and spending time with friends on the weekends," said @PERSON2. Those are my reasons why the effects computers have on people are not good.

Dear @CAPS1 and readers @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 a modern world sent back in time to the @NUM1 quickly drive your car to get groceries but must ride damage for hours to simply buy some milk. Entertainment is dull, and it is hard to receive books for learning. Ending the usage @ORGANIZATION1 such @ORGANIZATION1 technology as computers would surely be the first step to sending us back to such a barbaric time! Computers present job opportunities, educational opportunities, and a way to communicate with others! Furge you to continue using computers, for without computers our modern civiliz would be lost! Firstly, it is important to note, during our economic crisis, that the development and manufacturing @ORGANIZATION1 computers creates thousands @ORGANIZATION1 jobs! In fact, each year @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION3 jobs are created in the @CAPS5.S alone in accordance with the development @ORGANIZATION1 computers! @CAPS14 the customers who buy these products were to stop losing them, these jobs would be lost and any progress we've made in the economic crisis would surely fall! Do you, the fair people @ORGANIZATION1 our nation, wish to be responsible for such a catastrophe! Recently, the @ORGANIZATION3 stated, in the cover page article, that, "without the development @ORGANIZATION1 computers in technology in @DATE2, @DATE3 more people would be without jobs in the @LOCATION4A! " @CAPS6, undoubtedly many educational opportunities woulf be lost for your childred @CAPS14 you were to stop using computers! Computers present the easiet way to research and gather information.

Then, when my mon bought me a laptop, we were able to speak to each other again. Sge helps ne through all @ORGANIZATION1 mt personal problems, and without this way @ORGANIZATION1 talking with her worl be lost. Now, @CAPS4 a modern, civilized world.

Dear local news paper, I think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age. Starting at thirteen and up through adulthood. People spend hours at a time on the computer when they canbe exercising or doing some type of activity out doors. Computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away form them. Spending so much time on a computer can really damage a person posture. It is said that when some get on a computer a state of comfortbility comes over them and they lean over with their backs bent and they there for periods of time. Imagin a person being cramped in a tight space for eight hours and when that person gets out they all their joints and muscles being stretched from that point of tensions. This is what we do to our bodys when we get on computers.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers do benefit society in a positive way. Without computers we would not be able to be as social. We also would not have the ability to do reseach for school online and running a business would be even more difficult. Without computers our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. the main way of being social these days, other than texting, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a skype and facabook, and I am able to access them everyday. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and texting. Everyday I workout and lift weights and go on facebook, that is why that whole statement, "spending less time exercising, and more time on the computer" is false. Facebook and skype are a past of my everyday life and without them I know I would not be as social. Computers are also a part of my everyday life, because I have to use it to do research for school or typing up an @CAPS5 paper. As you have now seen, my handwriting is not so great, so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it. Without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work. Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade, which is not as presentable. Overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework. Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers some businesses would be unable to function, and those could function, would be awful slow. Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers, if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined. Computers also simplify work for businesses, they speed up the tasks that would takes a long time to be hand done and they complete the tasks that could not be acheived without a computer. Computers play a large part in the @CAPS6 of the world.

Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I agree with the experts that people spend to much time on the computer, people should be exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. But people are so lazy and would rather be sitting and doing something on the computer and if they dont start doing other things instead of being online they could become overweight. My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercize. Seriously people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy. My second reason why I think people should spend less time online is because you should be spending time with your friends and family not ignoring them because your doing something on the computer. Thats just rude, so why dont you go and have a family game night or go out to eat with your family and you could also watch a movie, go skating, or even go to the park with your friends because thats a lot more fun than being online all day. My last reason why people should spend less time online is because everyone should have time to just read a good book honestly just walk down to your local library and check out a book because reading is way better for your brain than doing stupid stuff on the computer. So in conclusion, in my opinion I think people should spend less time online is because if you dont get enough exercize you can become over weight and lazy, and not spending a lot of time with your friends and family is just rude and reading is very good for you unlike staying on the computer, well that is all I have to say for now.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 that humanity has, has it's up and down's and it's positives and negatives. the something with technology. It has it's ups's and downs but because of it our society grows increasingly advanced. It gives us the oppertunity to grow more sophisticated to set our goals beyond reach. We make the start of great things with these. Computers teach us and sometimes can guide you. You can click on a link and give you an amazing oppertunity or click on the wrong one and give you d virus. Computers can get you away from all the stress in your life and take you to a beautiful place it can give you the chance to let you learn something that you didn't even know existed.
<START>

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Are you aware that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 families have ownership to a computer? Maybe so, but, were you informed that at least half of that @PERCENT1 have family issues or such related The issue in bond is if computers have a possitive effect or negetive effect on mankind. In @CAPS4 opinion, I feel that this invention @MONTH1 be is taking a negetive toll on society. I say this because now-a-days there are inappropriate websites that children should veiw, and it takes away time with family. But mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue. Without a doubt, youngsters such as are expertly and a website, we'll just do as we were told and on maybe we could find one by an accident. Who knows? All I know is, there too many to count adult websites that children from the ages of @DATE1 log on to everyday. This is unacceptable on a person why we should be prohibited in computers. No responsible parent would be caught dead with a @NUM1 year old on an adult website and computers make it harder such parents to do so. With such experience computers take away time with and when I had @CAPS4 computer, @CAPS4 always now we never spent time with her. She said the other day do I peel bananas," if i never got out on the computer, you would be right now," she was right. Whenever @CAPS4 brother and I got on the computer we'll stay in the all day. But every we've been together much @CAPS4 now and I feel that computers have a negetive effect on society is because of the recent @CAPS3 I was called to the office one day to be informed that a crew on @CAPS3 com had befriended me and they were using boys and girls for drugs and prostitution. People take advantage of computers and end reading peoples infos. This could have been prevented but it wasnt. Now it's your chance, I hope you will feel the same way as me when it comes to the negetives and positives of computers. But remember, computers have keep more websites that aren't good for young kids, it takes away time from family, but mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue.

Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it.
<START>

Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 your latest article on the goods and bads of computers in our society was informative, I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consiquences, who knows where our world is heading? First off, I'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, but especally computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that "@CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've seen a drastic spike in obesity-related heart disease and diabetes." And @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Because of the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or @CAPS5 then go for a bikeride or play a game of fastball with friends. Because of this, more and more people become victims of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone elipses that could leave them paralized for the rest of their life. Is playing that online game so important, to you that its worth your life? Next, I'd like to touch on the fact that @CAPS1 the internet @MONTH1 seem like a great place to do some socializing, it can actually aid in losing friends insted of making them. I know what your thinking, @PERSON2, 'But sites like '@CAPS6' help people connect, why would they lose friends?' @CAPS7, really. Since its so easy to type in a conversation, people are losing actual social skills. They also spend too much time talking to friends without meeting face-to-face, and that eventually causes them to drift apart. And when talking to someone over a screen, its so hard to know if your actually close friends. Because of this, they cant bond and they wont have a real friendship. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 year old at @ORGANIZATION1, says that him and his best friend now only talk over @CAPS3, and they dont even feel like true friends anymore. So finally, I have a request. Next time you turn on that laptop, think. Is this really worth losing your friends and even your health @CAPS2? Next time feel the urge to update your status with something like '@CAPS8 got home,' @CAPS8 call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for the time to read my letter.

Dear local Newspaper editor, More and more people are using computers, but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Other experts disagree. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they let you learn about anything all over the world, they let you talk online with other people, and teach hand eye coordination. I think that computers are very helpful. Dont you love having the oppritunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about? I'm sure that everyone who has a computer does. With computers, you can use search engines like, google, yahoo, ask, and so many more. I know that computers help me with research all the time when I do projects or write papers for school. The internet is a great, reliable that you cango to when researching a topic for shcool or even just looking for an answer to a simple question. My next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online. Things like facebook, email, myspace, and web-caming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world. For example, I have an aunt that lives in @LOCATION1, and on christmas me and my family used my cousins webcam to see her and talk to her when we couldnt be with her on a special holiday. Also, things like facebook and myspace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world. My last reason why I think computers have a positve effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure time activity. There are all kinds of fun games you can play, and some even let you compete with other people around the world. For example, internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else. There are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection. Its obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family and leisure activities. I hope you agree with me!
<START>

Do you think that computer's are good? Well, I do. There are many reasons why I and you should think, this. For example, it has possitive effect on people, it teaches hand-eye coordination, and it allows people to talk to online with other people. One reason why you should think that computers are good is it has a positive effect on people!! Don't you want to be happy. well then, computers is your online fun source!! And your an learn a lot from computer!! Another reason is that the computers teaches hand-eye coordinbation. Hand-eye coordination is excellent skill that you need in life. For example, lets say that you want to play baseball, and you have no hand-eye coordination and you trip and @DATE1 and you brake something. that isn't good for you, is it. No, it is not good. But, if you had better hand-eye coordination then you probably wouldn't have fallen! The @NUM1 reason is that, you can interact with others online. You can @CAPS1, you can go on chat rooms. Or you can go on gaming sources, and interact with other people!! And, you can go online dating! The computer is a greet way to meet new people that share the same characteristics as you!! If you already have a computer then your fine. But, if you don't then you need to get one. And I am right!! People that don't have a computer have no jb. because people with jobs most of the time have use or have computer. In conclusion, you need to get a computer!! Why? well, that because you can alot of stuff on a computer. For example, you can teach hand eye coordition, and you can chat with online friends. Also, it gives you a possitive effect.

Dear local newspaper, I believe that with too much use of computer it will have bad affects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also use a lot of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad affects computers have, but their not all bad, without them life might be a little harder. Playing computer games, and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them everyday. Online poker could be dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in debt. Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop. It's a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addicting too. There's a website that called addicting. I guess people don't know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 goes to computer? Thats almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic chrisis I don't think enery should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people any need. If everyone didn't need computers to communicate and everything there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. I understand emailing, and facebook. But don't get out of hand with it. Isnt being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or excercise rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not excercising. I remember when I was younger, everytime I went to my friends house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most @CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I would define they rather excersise or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer it can have bad affects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family?

Dear newspaper editor, I think we should have internet, or computers at our houses. We should have it because we can chat with our friends and family, noone would get bored doing nothing and we learn new things from different websites. We should be able to communicate to our friends and family @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in our school think having a computer is good. For example my friend moved to @LOCATION1, we couldn't talk on the phone. It was long distance I talk to her over facebook. There are a lot of websites you can talk on like facebook, twitter or even myspace you can even skype. skype is when you have a webcam and you talk threw it. My mom said that most of her friends chat online with her. It doesn't matter how old are you. Anyone can learn important things. There are a lot of websites that are educational @PERCENT1 things on the computer are worth having. If you are old and you can't go to school just go to google and type any math term, science, @CAPS1, or even learning a new language. Everytime I have to do my social studies homework I go online trust me it's really helpful. Some things on the computer are very fun. You won't get bored on the type of games they have. A lot of parents complain that their children are doing bad things in the streets. The do there kind of things, because are bored @NUM3 people think that statement is true. If they had a computer, and playing games, or talking to friends, they would be like they are. @STATE1 and @PERSON1 are two state that have more people that go on the computer than any others states. Remember it's not only fun. Everyone enjoys having a computer. I think we should have internet access because we can do a lot of things some people think it's bad, but not everything is. We should have a computer, because, we can chat with friends, we can learn important and interestings things and we won't get bored. I hope you made up your mind and decided that all internet access is not a waste of time. I'm not the only one that thinks that " a computer is what keeps or alive".

When people think about computers the first thing they think of is games. Thats not all they are good for. For most people they are very usefull. Computers are great for @ORGANIZATION1. At @ORGANIZATION1 they help with homework and projects. When we are assigned a project we need to do research on a topic and the fastest and easier way is by computer. The students at @ORGANIZATION2, especially @NUM1 graded, are able to type up easys because it's faster and alot easier. If we are at home and we forgot our homework we could look it up online. This can be really helpful and convient to students and teachers. Sometimes it's not @ORGANIZATION1 but its finding things. Technology and computers have came a long way. Now we can look up directions to places we dont or cant find. People can also finding names, numbers, or address useing websites like yellow pages can be a relieable resource for that. Say your going for vaction and your try to find somewhere to stay it could be tough but there are websites you can go on were if you want something fast or mabye a nice hotel for a low price you can find it. The computer can be very fan and intersting when you go places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and you want to show picture of the great time you had so you can post them online. Say you havent talked to and old friend in a while, you can look for them on @CAPS3 or another website and start talking agian you can also play games and connect with friends or play games with friends while online. Weather its @ORGANIZATION1, finding things, or connecting with frends the computer has what ever you need. Maybe it will at one point get damged but they have people who can fix it. Plus if you think about it computers have very reliable resourses that are more updated then books.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 of the students and staff members of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 school find computers verry important. Computers not only help people in school but at home too. I know that the readers of this artical will agree that computers are verry helpful, they teach us about people and things far away, and they are great for chating online! Most people use compoters every day! Computers are verry helpful tools in every day life. They always have a program that if you spell something wrong it corrects you. Computers even have websites of a dictionary were people can look up words. I know this is verry helpful because my brother is writing his collige essays and their are no colliges that will be impressed by a gramaticly incorrect essay. Computers also help you find things you need really fast, like food restrants and the closest malls, or even jobs! Not only do computers help people with spelling and jobs but they also can teach us about far away places. Computers can show and tell us of wonderful places beond what we have scean. A lot of normal societys familys have been on vacation before. To find an intriging place to go they can look it up on the world wide web. Even if a family cant go on a vacation they can still find from their computer cheeper closer things to do. When computers are beig used to find places and thing across the world and near you is they can also give teens the oppritunity to chat with their friends online. A lot of students in @CAPS3 hallow school have a facebook account. Most use this account to talk to their friends online. I also have a facebook and I use it almost everyday to talk to my cousin from @LOCATION1 that I havent scean sence I was @NUM3. But, computers arent just used for fun chating they can also be used for school blogs. In my language arts class we have a reading blog that every student has to participate in. This blog allows the class to not wast class time to talk about recently read books. In conclusion computers should be taken seriosly because they do help society. Computers help us every day, they teach us and they can be verry fun and eductional. Remember what @PERSON1 from the department of tecnolgey at @ORGANIZATION1 said, "@CAPS5 can only get better if socitey accepts it."

Computers can affect people in many ways. Most people use computers too much and it can affect their health and the peole around them. People need to get out side and get more active. America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time. Familys are constantly having problems about family members who never have time to talk and funch holes in walls for losing a video game. Dr. @PERSON1 or "The studies of the human mind" says "I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people." That goes to show it can cause problems in familys everywhere because of a video game! So please make sure you try to spend time with your family. So that shows that the computer can be fun, but also dangerous.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 writers, @CAPS3 are an avrage of @NUM1 computers per house. That is just too much. I think society is too much time in computers. Computers are taking over our life. Spending time on the computer runs up the electric bill. Computers are one of the leading problems with weight and you are  and interesting with society when on the computer. @CAPS4 you spend too much time on the computer you run up your electric bill do you realy want to be spending @NUM2$  in a month or would you rather get groceries, or even pay bills with that money. " On avrage a family who used less computers saved @MONEY1 than a spends more time on thier computer. "@CAPS4  i knew how much I save I would decanated computer" says gamer I didn't know how much my hobbie was me" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 is the problem life. The worst problem with computers is you dont  with society @CAPS4 you spend most of your time on the computer you wont have alot of friends in real life. You @MONTH1 have online in real life toy call in love. I other than paly on the computer. I think society spending too much time in the computer. Computers such as the electrisity bill, when you the computer, you gain and dont participate with society so get off that computer and.

Computers. Theres fun. But there's also a down side. People spent more time on it than outside or exersizing or even getting together with friends and family. But on ther hand, they're also fun, help kids, and even help get together from dating sites. It makes them happy. It's fun! Computers are fun. They provide a wide arrow of games, educational can just plain fun. You can play role playing games (which and fun because I play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on islands, or other downlodabal education games that are, @CAPS1 not fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child. They also can help kids learn how to and other things at a very early age. Some very adults have and various other things that I cannot the life of me think of @CAPS2 thing computer get them together and they are happy. They do this hundreds of a day. Take away computers and people will die alone and sad. so in conclusion my ideas where! fun help kids and help older people get together. Read this and @CAPS3 sure you'll see it my way.

Hi my name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing to the local news paper to say that computers are good for people and helps alot like how to get one place two another, how to learn about black history or famous people that did something to the world, and how to find out the news and weather from home or at work, how to keep your besnness going without computers their jobs would be hopless, and like of your family or you tyring to make it in life and the only way to get in contact would be the computers there are computers every where even doctors use them at a hospital to keep people alive to see what wrong with them and where they came from, and one more jobs need computers to, to see if the person is capable for the job so they might look for background information with out it even you would not have a good job so hee are some resons why computers are important. One of them is we need computers for so that we can get around, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers. There lots of more stuff that coulf have said that prove computers are good and why we need them but i just had to cut it short and schools need computers the most to take test on the computers of they have to, so thats all the resons why we need computer and why they are good bye.

I personally believe that computersdo benefit society in a lot of ways. It can give you all the information you need with just a click of a button, entertainment is easy to find by searching the internet, and most importantly, it improves communication between people. One way computers benefit society is, by making it easier for everyone to get information about something. This is needed, especially in school. It can help kids get their information about the person they are writing about in their report.Getting information easily on the internet can also help people in other ways. What if someone needed to get the hospital's phone number in case of an emergency? He can use the computer to help him find that phone number. Another way computers benefit society is by allowing us to get any form of entertainment easily. This is what majority of the people in our society rely on. Alot of people use the computer to play games, listen to music, and watch online videos. If someone was bored right now, he or she could use the computer to play fun games. What if that person thought it was a little quiet in his or her room? He or she could then use the computer to listen to music. Without computers we would probably be really bored for the rest of our lives. Finally, and most importantly, computers help improve communication between people. This is probably what everyone uses the computer for. Now you can send electronic mail to your friends in just seconds, post and view pictures of your family or relatives and you can even use an instant messanger to write to your friend and get messages from your friend in the fastest speed possible! Without computers, communication between others would be very hard. As you can see, computers can give you information easily, entertainment is not hard to find, and it can even improve communication between people around our society and the world.! Computers are very helpful to us and improves everything about the way we live.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer has been a resource we have been using for years and gives you information and pictures but that doesn't mean people have to be on it all the time. People can talk some times with other people or go on the webcam to see a loved one who's in iraq but the need to go outside to exercise just to take a walk around the block. They don't even need to leave the house all the time just excercise to a tape or get a tredmill. Thats all people need to do instead sitting on thier butts all day move around. People becoming obease has risen because of lack of excercise so grab your shoes and go jog a couple blocks in your niehbor hood just do little things and you will feel much better than you were on your computer. Nature is all around us but most people don't noice because their on the computers. Which needs to end now these beautiful land marks across the world are being wasted because hardly any ones looking at them. Go to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, even @CAPS1 and get some fresh clean air thats not from your home you can go to the park to just look at the birds just see something without a screen on it. So go got your camera and go some where with wild life and have fun. Just doing these things will help your health, energy and your mind. You can go on the computer and chat with friends but not all the time. Do you want to be unhealthy in life if not go outside and take a walk.
<START>

Dear Local @CAPS1, I have been infromed that people don't get to talk to friends/family, enjoy nature and exercise because of computers. Well computers benefit our life. The first thing about/ computers is communication. People can use @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and etc. The social networking groups are for abilities to talk to friends, long distance or close and family enjoy research. Just because @CAPS11 use those internet websites doesn't mean @CAPS11 can't go outside and enjoy activities. This leads to other objects called peortables. As technology advances so does our skills. Every year more electronics are made and most likely are portable such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6 phones, @CAPS7, and etc. Many of these companies let us take these devices to allow as to do everyday things. With @ORGANIZATION1 creater of the @CAPS8 @CAPS11 can use this internet/music @CAPS9 for everything. for example, I visit my grandparents and I decied to my @CAPS6 phone. I can talk to friends on my @CAPS6 phone by texting and visit my grandparents. More of this opplies to and @CAPS5 @CAPS11 still all go outside and enjoy life. exercise is something @CAPS11 should yet to. If you stay cramed in your house @CAPS12 fun. @CAPS11 need to cheer up and go outside and play sports. @CAPS11 could get included in and join activity. @CAPS11 also can have videos online to show us how to exercise or use yoga. Most of use portables which goes back to my last paragraph. Exercise is big and @CAPS11 all should do it. What I'm trying to say here @CAPS11 can use computers and electronics and exercise with fun one in all. If you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I am writing to tell you I think that computers are a good thing because they let people communicate, tons of people haves jobs because of computers and People have help with homework because of computers. People communicate by email and aim and facebook and everything else. People have jobs on computers like cortreporters and tax-retelers and sales people. Lastley kids do homework on the computer and look up stuff "@CAPS1 related" on the computer and the other stuff like that. lastley I think computers are good for people, they help with education, work and comunication with friends and family.

Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion I support the advances in technology. Advances in technology helps us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is because computers/phones can help us get information on things we need to get information on. We need to know what is going on around us, all the time. We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives. We need to know the weather/traffic conditions if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co-worker sent you anything important that you need to know about. The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online. We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer. Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy, even though we can't see them in person. I, for one, knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online. Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong. The last reason why I support advances in technology is because computers can help us with our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. Computers can help our reading skills because if we don't have time to go to the bookstore to get a book, we can read the book online for free. It can help our hand-eye coordination because it can help our fingers move faster and help us do things faster. I stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends / family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills.

Dear newspaper editor: @CAPS1 are all living in the age of technology. There are many useful devices that help us live our every day lives. The computer is a major help. @CAPS1 can talk with relitives from different areas and you can surf the internet to learn new information. @CAPS4 you can playing games with people from ground the world. The computer is a great divice. Almost everyone has a relitive that lives in another state or country. Well you never see them because they live far away right? With a computrer you can talk and even have a face to face conversation with them. @CAPS2 can bring your family closer together. For example, my family just got a new computer and @CAPS1 have relitives that live in florida that @CAPS1 almost never see. With the computer my dad talks to them almost everyday. Some people that I have talked to said that ther are excited to see their relitives or friends more often. @CAPS2 has brought them closer together and made them better friends. The internet is a wonder place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics. When kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 saves time. @PERCENT1 of kids said that when they are doing a project the best thing to use would be the internet. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 helps the kids work faster so they can spend more time outside or hanging out with their friends. Another thing you can do is learn about recent events. For example most local newspaper have a website that you can visit. Even if you local does not you can go to other websites like "@CAPS3". They have recent events that happen around the country and around the world. The internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life. Every kid gets bored when its a rainy day. So they can play games with people from around the world using a computer. The are many websites that have fun games that are fun and enjoyabal. You can @CAPS4 become with people from other contrys. My friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 play the computer and they have alot of friends from other contrys. I think that its cool that you are playing the exact game with another. Person in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, @CAPS4 most of the games are safe and fun to play. Another thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your home town. I have many times playes games with @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @CAPS2's a fun thing to do during a boring, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful divice thats benefits us and helps us with our everyday life. @CAPS2 allows us to connect with family in far away places and surf the internet for new information. @CAPS4 you can play games with people from around the world. Its a wonderful divice and lets start using @CAPS2.

Dear local news, @CAPS2 more and more people use computers people ask if computers actually benifit society. In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, acess to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society here in why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite @CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like @CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the @CAPS1 were @CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather. Instead or local news imidiatly acess it on you @CAPS4 you can acess encyclopedia and distionarys like at the websites @CAPS5 provide an easy imidiats fools for daily uses. One least example towards the of computers Their are many websites that you can. One of @CAPS5 websites is called , @CAPS6 lets you upload picture of pople or family events for people in you @MONTH1 video chat with people over a and see the other persons face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like @CAPS6 it is actually adding time. In conclution, @CAPS5 reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society, They provide entertainment, easy acess to and have many websites for social interactions, @CAPS7 society would be alot harder and this is why I think computers benifit society.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a computer is a benefit. They help us in so many ways. It is very helpful, it could make someone's life easier to handle. You could keep in touch with old friends or family. It would be easier for work, and when you're bored, you could play some fun games. It's very hard to have family you can't see and keep in touch with! With a computer you could send messages and photo's to interact with them. You wouldn't have to worry about ever losing communication with them. You could also meet new people. Get new friends from anywhere in the world! Have friends from all different race and culture. Computer's are a great way to interact with others, whether its family or friends. It's always had to do work when you have no clue what it's about! if your ever @CAPS3 trouble on something you could always look up information about it. You could learn how to do things or learn more information about a certain item. When you have homework and don't know the meaning of a word, you could always look up the definition of it. They also hold your information. For example, instead of @CAPS3 a ton of papers you could simple just save it in your computer. Then you could print it out whenever you need it. Computers make work easier and help you organise better. Computer's also amuse you as well. When you have nothing to do, you could play alot of fun game's. You could also watch music video's or funny videos to get you laughing. They have practicly anything you want to play. You would hardly ever get bored! As you see, computer's are a benefit to people. It's always helpful when you could keep in touch with anyone, have help with your work, or simply keep yourself entertained. Without computers life would be harder and boring!

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a helpful advantage in the @CAPS4's life. It offers and contributes many ideas and actions. Computers help people find a nice spot to travel. Also it helps people meet or make @CAPS1 friends. A computer is another way for people to get thier hand-eye cordination better. Computers are very helpfull in a humans life. Computers are usefull when trying to explore @CAPS1 places. One can book a flight anywhere in a matter of minits on a computer. How else would it be possible to travel somplace far away without booking a flight on a computer. Next, computers help learn about different coltures. Once one has booked reservations to a certain travel spot on thier computer, they will learn much about the unfamiliar land they have went to. My family has gone to many different areas around the world. The trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers. The computer makes it possible to experience to territorys. It is a key item when someone is looking to travel. A computer is emensly important when trying to communicate with friends. People can meet and make friends very simply using websites such as facebook on the computer. Facebook creats friendship very easily. I recently waited to get to know a students better. I looked him up on facebook and now we are aqetances. Next, programs on the computers such as A.I.M. help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics. Lastly, if one wants to get to know another better he or she can look at thier blog. They @MONTH1 start to talk and become good friends. Computers are usfull when trying to comunicate or find friends. Computers not only help with travel and friends but it also helps with ones hand eye cordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand eye coordination. This action can help with sports. For example in baseball one must have a good hand eye cordination to help catch and hit the ball. Secondly, with hand eye cordination getting better with the computer. it helps kids fit in. If one has good hand eye cordination they can play sports are make friends. If one becomes good with hand eye cordination and typeing they will be able to get a job writing for a newspaper or a book. Hand eye cordination and typing with computers can lead to a succesfull life. Computers in an @CAPS5 life can help in the long run. It will help with travel plans, friends, and hand eye cordination.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that people are spending to much time on there computers and not exercising as they're supouse to do every day. @CAPS5 @CAPS3 says that @PERCENT1 of all people in the intere world are spending to much time on the @CAPS3 and not enjoying nature. So they don't get exercis like other people do. @CAPS5 @CAPS4 says that people that go out side and not stair at there computers will live a long and helthy life. I say that @PERCENT2 of all people that are always on the @CAPS3 often go blind and will never see who the world is changing awound them. I say that @PERCENT3 of all people that don't always go on the @CAPS3 will live a better life then the people that are always on the @CAPS3. My @CAPS5 told me that you should go on the @CAPS3 just not for a very long time because beeing on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not so good for you so don't go on the @CAPS3 for a very long time only for a short amount of time and don't go on the @CAPS3 every day only like @NUM1 time a week. People that have @CAPS6 book acounts you shouldn't go on it like every day go on like @NUM1 to @NUM3 time a week because going on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not good for people. My @CAPS5 @CAPS8 says that @PERCENT4 of all people in the world have @CAPS9 and ofthen go blind because of them using the @CAPS3 all the time and that if you go on it for to long your @CAPS3 will mealt down and brake. I realy think that people shouldn't go on the @CAPS3 for every long time because every time they go on is a time that they will miss in the life so please don't do it.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 have many debated on whether computers are good or bad. @CAPS6, I believe that computers aren't as good as many people think. Ever since computers were invented people haven't been exercising. Also less kids are reading. Lastly computers are taking away family time. When was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport? If you haven't it's probably because they are inside with their eyes glued to a computer screen. Exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit. More kids are becoming over weight everyday. Computer are just another reason why. I had a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer. She became very lazy. She never wanted to exercise or doing anything active. Little by little she started gaining weight. This is happening all around the world and it need to @CAPS4! What's your reading level? @CAPS3 are students in @NUM1 grade with a @NUM2 grade reading level. Part of the reason is because they rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book. Schools now do program called @CAPS5 @NUM3. This program is designed to help students improve their reading levels. I believe that if students would turn off the computers long enough and @CAPS5 we wouldn't need this program. My mom makes sure I @CAPS5 for at least @NUM4 mins everyday. Every student do the same. I remember a saying "family time is golden time" @CAPS6, now a days no one spends time with their family. Once again computers have played a part in this too. It's not just kids who have droped family time for computer time. It's adults too. I think the last time I spent some time with my family was about @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit. After that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens. In conclusion, the computers

I believe computers have a positive effect on people because computers can help people in many ways. You can e-mail friends from across the world, get important information you might need, and also you can do business online. Computers have fasinating things to show and inform. Most people that have computers can use them for e-mailing friends. Sometimes your closest friends are across the country & you want to talk to them. Why not e-mailing them on your computer? It would mean a lot to your friends it you just take time to say hello through e-mail. My second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because. Some middle school through college & the rest of you life need to use computers. Maybe because of some important information they might need for an assignment from a teacher. Not all the time you can find certain things in books. Now a days computers are taking over books. My third opinion for computers is that some people are to ill to go to work so they work online. Even though you are ill you will still be getting paid because you are still working. So women just had a baby & she is using her computer to work online. So she can make money so she can support her femily. In conclusion, my opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people because they are used for e-mailing friends, finding out important information for school purposes or job purposes. My last opinion is that computers are used for working online. To me, I think computers are a positive effect on people.

Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' schoolworks. Finally, you are able to talk with other people on-line. These are just a few points why computers are very importent, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind becasue you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convinient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in-laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, now-a-days they even have on-line tutors and on-line colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With videochat, chatrooms, facebook and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even on-line dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after mu uncle divoriced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those on-line dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way. In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic inevntion because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home. recieve help with your schoolwork, and talk with other people on-line. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time.

@CAPS1 you know we all like computers and we all use it for all different tyoes off things like to chat or to do work and most importantly to fine something but computers are in a way not that good for you especially if your computer is your life, one reason I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are on it for when you are on it for along time you get hungry then you get some snaks and by the time your done using the computer gained. A pound no imagin how much wiget you will gain if you do that every day alot! My next reason why I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are the computer too long your eyes start to hurt and your hands start to cramp and everything starts to hurt to much typing and looking at the same thing for along to can make you have eye problems and can also give you something in your hands and then you will not to be able to do anything with your hands for along time because it will start hurting. My last reason why i think computers in a way are bad because it can mess your computers up it can over heat or just down because you have ben on it for too long. It can also get a virese then you will just have to get a whole new computer @CAPS1 you can see there are plenty of reasons why I think computers are kinda bad
<START>

Many people have been talking about computers in the @ORGANIZATION1. Networks like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS2 have be saying that the computers are turning the people in lazy goodd for notings. But I say different! I think the advances in technology is a good thing. Way? I'll give you @NUM1 reasons. My first reason is they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Next reason is makes life better. And my last reson is it give you hand-eye coordination @CAPS3't you sick of haveng to go to the book stor and find a book to do a project? well now with the computers you don't have to. You just go online and look up the info that you need to learn about almost anything form the use to @LOCATION1. Next reason is computers make life better.

Dear local Newspaper, I was reading this article about computers. I agree with kids and adults not having time enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But, also, kids and adults should be having some fun time outside and enjoying it. But when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information. I think kids and adults need to get active and get healthy, because now kids don't want to play outside, so they can play outside, so they can play video games. When I was a little kid I would always play hide and seek but now my mother doesnt like to play anymore because of technology she rather be on the computer or on the phone. Kids all over the world now know how to use computers because they don't want to be outside. Computers are only helful when your doing a report or something, important. For example, people that have businesses they are going to need computers. Also when a teacher a sighs a project on someone your going to need a computer to search up information for that person. Finally alot of kids aren't taking responsibilty of school. They don't that school serious. Kids think that the computers will teach you everything well there wrong because things on the computer can be made up. But its also making there life very in healthy. So thats why computers are good usage and bad at time because kids don't play outside anymore and computer are helpfull for searching information so with. What I've sadi don't you agree with me?

Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a posotive effect on people. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. I think that both these opinions are correct. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habbit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. Using computers is something I know millions of people use everyday, and would think @CAPS2 would be difficult to live without. For example, my family owns four computers. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. For my mom, @CAPS2's usually working or checking her e-mails. For me and my sister, @CAPS2's researching and typing of homework, and communicating with our friends via facebook or. So say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn. Before these were computers, everyone used, but now that we have the internet, theres no really need to get a book. Most of the time people wont even have the book their looking either have to go out and buy get one from the library. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet thats quick, and. People also use computers to like I mentioned above with maybe facebook, @CAPS1, or e-mail.@CAPS2's quick, easy and fun. @CAPS2 also saves paper which helps the planet. We always use to send letters, but now with these sources, you don't need to much! Computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring. Now even though I mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. So many people use computers everyday, and @CAPS2's bad for your physical and mental health. People spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. This means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. They wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. In conclusion, I'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 many people think comptuers are bad there are many reasons as to why they are good. Computers are very environmental friendly and so are @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people today. They also allow us to type assignments and other important papers. People also don't know that they are not the worst @ORGANIZATION1 on the market today. Computers @MONTH1 take away time from people that they should be spending on excersice, but computers arent the only thing that do that more people spend time watching @CAPS5 then they do on any other activity, @PERSON2 head @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a survey in @DATE1. His survey showed that out @DATE1 the @NUM1 people questioned @PERCENT2 spent @NUM2 hours a day watching @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 spent @NUM3 hours on the computer, @PERCENT4 spent @NUM4 hours reading and @PERCENT5 spent @NUM4 hours excersising. So clearly computers are not our biggest problem. Many people today are "@CAPS7" or "@CAPS8-environment". So instead @DATE1 buying newspapers or magazines most people go online to research current events. @PERSON1, @CAPS9 @DATE1 the @ORGANIZATION2. Says if we use comptuers instead @DATE1 newspapers @PERCENT6 @DATE1 the trees we cut down each year will be save. So obviously computers are environment friendly. Todays youth is messier than it ever was. @CAPS10 are having a hard time grading papers and tests because @DATE1 kids hand writting. So instead @DATE1 handwritting papers, kids make it easier on @CAPS10 by typing their work. Rescent studies show that @PERCENT7 @DATE1 @CAPS10 find it easier + better for kids to type papers. This shows kids are better off typing papers, and assignments. I hope you now understand my position on computers. The help us in many other ways too. In conclusion, they are not as time-consuming as every one @MONTH1 think. They also help us with research, are enviromental-friendly, and help the youth @DATE1 our world become neater one click at a time.

Dear @PERSON1 I think myself that the computers could help u. With a lot of thing like my teacher gave my class some homework and we had to find facts about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. And if it wasn't for the computer I wouldn't know nothing about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. Plus the computer could help u find long lost family remembers because when my grandfather die my mother finded her sister on the computer. Plus on the computer I could find out about others states that I dont know about and the computer could teach u about a lot of thing my mother and teacher can't teach @CAPS5. Nah @CAPS6 just saying computers could teach u abt of things that people don't know about.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I rencently started researching the effects that computers have on people an have found some shocking facts. I do not belive computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future. My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fine, and thosands of creatures. With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities. Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead you can just @CAPS2 or email them and @CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person! In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers! Thank you for your time and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter.

To: @ORGANIZATION1 goes so fast, and the most they make more new invations. They had invented a computer which it helps people in the work they have to do, however there is a big problem, is that people are spending too much in the computer specialy teenagers. I suggest that is a horrible idea, because they are less time being active, also less time intracting with friends and family and @CAPS1 it is dangerous for teenagers. However many people @MONTH1 not ogrea with me. There is so many teenagers and adults that are just wasting time in the computer, instead of playing outside enjoying the nature, doing exercise and just having fun. Don't you think is a great idea. Well a friend of mine used to go outside everyday went outside to play. I think . Which I really miss her. You know when you go spent time with your family. But guess what they are in the computer, wasting time instead of spending time with your family. Do you think thats good? Well is not because thats how the family gather and stop coming to visit you. That's just so sad had family seperate. That's not all because do you think that people will be in dangerous problems, well they are. Do you know how you get a myspace and you meat a boy that says that is the name age as you and tells you if he could meet you and you say yes and lets say you were @NUM1 year old girl, he is like @NUM2 years old. He will abuse of you or kill you. You thought he was @NUM1 years old but he was not. I think is dangerous for kids. I think is a horrible idea of having computers, because you will be less time spending nature, also less time spending with your family and getting into dangerous things. However people @MONTH1 not agree with me, but what if your child was in dangerous. How would you feel? People should really think about having computers.
<START>

Who in the world would say a computer is useless. No one, computer are one of the most useful device ever made. I think that computers are perfect and can help you build skills. I have @NUM1 reason it build skills, fast information and fun. Now lets get started with skill. Skills are things you need to have if you want to pursue a career. You can learn skill from book, tv and computers. For example i learned how to type rapidly on a keyboard from a computer on a game called type to learn. After a week of this game. I was typing like a pro. The computer also has chess to help build stragety. Just ask my super smart english teacher @PERSON1 "she say that chess build's character and strength your mind. Moving along, i want to talk about how you can get information in a instant with computers. Experts say that it the number one way to get iinfo badly. I know i argeed with that, after study for a test on @LOCATION1 carver in my book, but one of my pages was missing so. I used my computer not only did i get my information quickly. I had gotten more information than the book. The next day i passed my test. @NUM2 percent . You how useful a computer can do. Finally, i want to talk to you about good old faishon fun. As you know are perfect for building skill and get information, but you can away alway use a computer for fun. Do you know anyone in the world that can say the computer is not fun. No you can't because everyone in the world use the computer for fun stuff like online game, video and talk to people. Thanks for my reason about computer building skill, having info and fun.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In many ways computers have been very useful to the human rare. They can been used to look up information, talk to family and friends music etc. Don't you think people are wasting more time on the computer instead of getting exercise. It's clear that computers can do just about anything want than to do. But why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family. Playing sports, or getting some fresh air. I think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends. i know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school. In my opinion I think it is a great way so you can catch up on funny times that you can and friends shared. Now here comes the negative effect. Mang kids get bulled and picked by other kids over the internet. This can cause other kids to have a low self esteem, and cause dangerous events in the future. When it comes to computer they have saved many people life. Some of these ways are finding cures to harmful deases. Computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather. Wouldn't you agree that computers have played a huge role in our lifes. Sometimes we she take a break from them and enjoy nature. So have fun with technology and don't forget to stay active too.
<START>

Dear local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered why people spend so much time on the computer. The effect of people a computer is good and had because the good parts you can communicate with people in far away places, like you can talk to someone you went to @LOCATION1 with in @LOCATION1 and / or @CAPS1 @LOCATION1 with. The bad part is that if your on the computer all the time then you are neglecting time with family and friends. When you are spending all of you time on the computer you are becoming a couch potatoe and its very unhealty of also a good reason is a family member moved and you had to communicate by webcam so if you like live in @LOCATION2 and you have all you family here in @STATE1 other by sending letter and by sending pictures but they cant see how you act and by phone you can only hear voices you can see anything. A lot people disagree because alot people think computers are a big waste so thats all i have to say on the subject.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 oppinon about computers are that people should use them. Think about your children, when they grow up they will need to know how to use a computer for school, or even a job. It also teaches hand eye cordanation for multi tasking. The computer is also fun and easy to use. I am almost positve that you love to use a computer, who dosn't? @CAPS2 first reason is that you will need to use a computer in everyday life. For example if you are going to a job interview most @CAPS3 will ask how meny words a minuet can you type you need to be proficant. Also at school if you have a writing asinment due then it would take more time writing it than typeing it. All @CAPS3 you will have to type one time or another. Aspesaily your job as an @CAPS1 you need to use a computer everyday. The computer also teaches hand eye cordanation. Hand eye cordanation is kinda like multi tasking you could type and talk on the phone or even excircising and txting. Hand eye cordanation is a very important skill in life. All @CAPS3 you will need to multi task like at a library you need to find a book and talk to people. Even driving a car you need to multi task to stay on the hand, you need to use one fast from brake and gas and you need to be looking at the road. You must to multi task along with hand eye cordination. Your in luck a computer teaches you. @CAPS2 last and final reason is its fun and easy to use. I was @NUM1 when I started uing a computer I loved to play fun games. I never could type but I caught on because if you are having fun while you it will be easy to turn. Just like math its not fun but you have to larn how to do it. So if you like having fun while lurning some thing the computer is for you. It's now or never for people to larn, get @CAPS3 and get good grades. Its fun and easy to lurn how to use. It teaches you hand eye cordanation plus multi tasking. You will absolutly need to know how to use a computer for @CAPS3 and school. We need computers for life we always will need to use computers for every single day of our lives. Don't tell people it will note your brain or you will become unhelthy from being on the computer look past it. Don't you see all the good uses for computers?
<START>

Here is my @CAPS1 I think computers are useful and here are my @NUM1 reasons one kids can talk to their friends @CAPS2 they are punsied. My second reasons is people can go on the computer @CAPS2 they are bored for ex: @CAPS2 a kid beat all teir games and @CAPS2 they are bored they go search for new ones to buy, my final reason is @CAPS2 people want to look up something for something 'like their project but @CAPS2 the labireey is closed they can just copy down the thing they need. My first reason is, kids can talk to their friends on the computer @CAPS2 they are grounded for ex: I was grounded in @DATE1 for slapping my cousion in face but I still got to talk my friends kthen we are still talking but the only way to trick your parterents are to tell you are aking your friend about homework. Myh second reasons is people can go on the computer @CAPS2 they are bored for ex: @CAPS2 a kid beat all his games and he is broded te can go serch for new ones to buy or rent them or play downloadable games for the computer. My final reason is @CAPS2 someone wants to look up something for his or her project and the liebreey is closed for information and copy it down for your project. My conclusion is we need computers to survive without them we will be in the stone age still.
<START>

Some people don’t like computers because of instant reason, and other people like computers little too much. I like computers but @CAPS1 not obsess with computers give good efforts on people, even me you can learn things off the computer and you start to get good hand eye coordination one of the things I like about the is that you can 'talk" to other people. Lots of people uses the computer a little too much that they dont exercise, or watch nature as much some normal (other) people should, and they dont spend them with their familys. I rather spend time on the computer for only (#@NUM1) three hours so then I can do other things with my time and you or anybody should do the same.
<START>

My opinion on computers is that I think it's a good idea for people to go on computers. I think this way because if you haven't seen someone for so many years then you got a chance to see that person or talk to that person through the computer. Computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do. I like to go on the computer to talk to my friends that I haven't seen a while you could also meet new people and make friends. If there wasn't computers then we would have to look through a lot of books for information, or go all the way to the bank to check your account balance, this is why I think computers are good ideas. On the computer you could see workouts to get fit we don't only have to go to the gym. My dad gose on the computer to talk to his sisters, or play games with other people arount the world. Another example I could use is my mom she talks to her family in @LOCATION1 and in other places too. If there wasn't computer's we couldn't our tests, we couldn't get information. I think computers are very good ideas, cause it's good when you got to pay your bills too. We could interact with friend and familys online too thats what a lot of tenns and aults do if there was a rainyday or if its snowing and we don't go the chance to see our friends or relitives. For some people they think it's not a good idea because some people get addicted to the computers, but there is so much that you could do that the computer won't get you board. Thats why I think that computers are a good idea and that they are very important.

A lot of people use computers today. But not everybody thinks they benifit society. But computers can do anything! You can do reaserch, you can play games, and most of all, be free. Were you ever given a school project to do, but no book has the information you want? Well the internet does. A lot of computers are connected to the interact where you can find anything! Are you trying to find facts for your science project? Just go on your favorite search engine and search your topic. You'll find endless pages on anything. Even if your not doing school work, you can find anything on the internet. Did you forget the number of your favorite football player? Search his name and it'll tell you right on your screen. Are you wondering why the @CAPS1 won the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Your choices are endless! Even if your computer doesn't have internet, you can play games. Playing games on your computer is a great hobbie! And if you are connected to the internet, you can play games with other people around the world. Playing games on your computer is a great hobbie, but you cant play all the time, you need to find other things to do to. There are a variety of computer games. Adventure games, shooting games multiple player games, and more! You can even play poker on your computer. I think the best part of any computer is your freeness while on one. You can do almost anything. You can go on the internet, play games and even talk with people. You can also customize your computer to your liking. Do you have a picture of your cat? You can put it as your background on the desktop. Want a different curser, you can change that to! You can change anything you want with just a click on your mouse. There you go, there are endless possibilities with computers. You can learn, play, and be free. But the most important part of using a computer is to enjoy it, and have fun!

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 personal experience, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Many people enjoy their time on the computer because, with today's technology so many things can be done and quicker too. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a computer at home. I do and its just great. I got most things done and in a matter of time. I think computers have a positive effect on people because today you can do almost anything. For example, I have family in @LOCATION2; @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION4, and instead of calling them on the phone, I could video chat with them and it feels like you're actually there. Also, now you can pay your bills online, and instead of sending a letter through mail and waiting when it will arrive and having to buy stamps that are extremely expensive, you could just simply send on e-mail-free of charge. Most college students do their homework on the computer. They type essays, or while doing research on someone or something, they could just save it and take notes on it later. So basically a computer is almost a part of everyone's life and it can be entertaining, fun, and used for more important things. What I'm trying to say is computers are a part of every teenagers routine during the day. We like to interact with our friends and listen to music and bond with family and other realtives who you don't usually contact all on one piece of technology. Some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something. Computers are important, a computer will scan this test of mine and give me a score, so I think now you will agree with me now when I say computers have had and always will have a positive effect on people. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my opinion and I hope you agree.

@DATE1 @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a huge affect on people. My thing about it is that the computer gets kids lazy and unactive. Having a computer will give kids the action to sit around and do nothing. I'm sure you've heard of websites such as myspace, facebook, formsping, etc. These websites can get a person to be willing to be on computer instead of exercising and staying healthy. I believe kids like me these day want to keep in touch with their friends. If the phone's not in the picture then the computer is. Also getting rid of the computer can stop the homosexuals from getting a hold of kids by acting their age. I will admit the computer can be useful but to be on all day that's just rediculous. I have a @NUM1 year old brother that stays on the computer from the time he gets til the time he goes to sleep. Compared to me he's not fit and healthy at all, that's what countless hours on the computer did to him. In fact he's on myspace so much that he has over @NUM2 friends and he doesn't even half of them he gives them his number and home address. Do you notice a lot of kids these days want to. can when you would rather waste the computer other than outside and at least self. I've always had a to football but I could @CAPS2 find the time to play with my brother. All they are about is chicks and of course the computer. I'm not asking to take away computer's in people's homes but put a stop to the daily number of hours spent on it because time is one thing that money can @CAPS2 buy. Some kids will look back to these days wondering how much time they wasted on nothing. long story short like life, dont spend it all on nothing.
<START>

Dear NewsPaper, people are spending too much time on computers. You could be outside enjoying nature, playing sports, or traveling. Some people say that you can learn about animals and plants on a computer, but there is nothing like really being outside with them. People who hike and really enjoy being outside are @PERCENT1 smarter than people who don't. I like being outside more than inside and I have straight A's. Sports are also a good way to get outside. My favorite sport is baseball and I am pretty good. Some places say that computers can help with your hand-eye-coordination, but how can a computer help you with that? Sports are what help you with hand-eye coordination. Playing sports can also help you get stronger. Baseball is why I can bench press @NUM1 pounds. @PERCENT2 of kids who play a sports are not over weight, but @PERCENT3 of kids who don't are. Traveling is also a good way to get outside. I love traveling. I am fluent in english french, and spanish. My favorite place to go is northern @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1. Computers can show you pictures of a place, but when you are actually there, it is really fascinating. A picture on a computer cannot even compare to what it is really like. You also cannot walk on a computer, or drink the water from a stream, or climb up a clift. There is really no comparison. Computers are alot worse and alot worse for real nature. Compared to real life and nature, there really is no comparison. Computers aren't as good as real life. You can enjoy nature playsports, an travel the world, all by just being outside. Thank you for your time.

Do you remember school projects sitting down bored and watching your @CAPS1 stations or sitting in the doctors office waiting bored out of your mind? Well no more! Since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those things are gone. There was once a time when the only way to do a project on a country was to look in the paper untill you found something now with computer advancements you can enter a country's came into google, a search site, and up comes @NUM1 things on that country. In fact @PERSON1 a expert on computers and inventor of one of the most advanced computers on earth says that searching for information is now @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 eisier depending on the topic. Also you no longer have to work a redundunt type write that always makes mistakes that you have to retype. You can just use @ORGANIZATION1 and you type your essay. Anything speelled wrong is underlined in red so you only rarely have a spelling mistake. As a result of this increase in knolage, from a learning stand point computers are extremly good for mankind. My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining. On your new laptop you can go on miniclip or addicting games, both gaming websites and play games. These game while not only are fun improve handeye coordination which helps with sports, driving, writirs and many other things. More advanced gaming computers called consoles such as the @CAPS2-box @NUM2, by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4 provide exteme gaming experience. One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world. Not only that but advanced games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 improve eyesight. Studies show that playing a high action game @NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @NUM6 serving carrots a day. My final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits. If you've everyone to @CAPS10 you know that the lime can be @NUM4 hrs long. People used to wait that just standing there. Now people can pull out their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player and listen to music. The @CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as well as play music, videos and games. If you are lucky enough to have an I touch you can check email, stocks, weather and news right on your @CAPS13 as well as buy songs which can be @NUM9 cheaper than @CAPS14. In conclusion all of this advantage in technology benifits us greatly. We can now learn about new exiting things have fun while improving eyesight and we don't have to wait.

Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 i think some peoples are not to much on the computers. Some peoples might be talk to their family members. To see if they are ok or if they are bad so they can know. How about if someone die in they family and they don't know notthing about that peoples. It might ben their parents, grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles or it might ben one of their best friends. Some people also might be on their bank acount. To see if they can get out money fror the bank. Might also be sending money by going to the computer and be sending to their family members. They might be paying a bill by the computer. The money they own to that bank or they might be doing some thing eles. I also think people are useing the computer to much. Just like kids they go on the computer to just play games. That's not go for the little kid because if they keep going on the computers. They might not want to get away from the computer. Then parents will have so hard time calling their kids to go eat or to go to sleep. That's going to be a hard work to do. So i think some people should go outside to do exercis and enjoy the nature. I do beleve to people will go outside and do exercis, enjoy the nature, and spenting more time with their family. And thank you local newspapers. Some people are also now things about people are about some eles.

I People spend too much time on the computer. A lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day. They should be spending time with family and friends. People never have enough time for activities. Also computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends, homework,research, games @CAPS1 bored, and work. To begin with, people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than on the computer. For example @CAPS1 your mother or father asked you @CAPS1 you wanted to go out to dinner and you said no, I'm on the computer, that would just mean your obsessed with going on the computer. A lot of families are bing broken apart because people spend too much time on the computer @CAPS1 you have a friend over and they say I am bored and all you are doing is play games on the computer than that is just being rude because your friend is bored. So you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones. Previously I stated how people spend time with loved ones, well people need to spend more time doing activities as well. A lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat. @CAPS1 you are gaining weight because your on the computer than you need to go do some activite to off that fat. @CAPS1 you are a teen and you are given the idea to play a sport and you it because computer is more important then is some serious obesession with the computer. As a result, the computer should be used wisely. The computer should be used to talk to family and friends, homework, research, work, and @CAPS1 you bored play some games little games on the computer. Those are probably the most important things that should most likely used for the computer. A lot of these things that I have listed are important because @CAPS1 you go on the computer just to be on and watch people talk then what's the point of wasting your time on the computer when you could be doing much more different things on the computer. For example, @CAPS1 you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions you can go to www.dictionary.com to find them, or @CAPS1 you just need to define a simple word. In conclusion, people spend too much time on the computer. They need to be spending more time with family and friends. Also people need to be doing more activities in their lives. Lastly, you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research. So, as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am aware that many people are stateing that people spend too much time on computers and not getting enuff exercise well I have that their are a lot of people useing computers and they are gettiing enuff use. Im going to explane why within the most few paragraphs. First I would like to start off by saying its good that people are into computers and working with them because that books their learning activities and they learn new thinngs and it will help them be sucessfull in life, people play games, cross word puzzles, riddles, and many more. Same use the internet for ingredence, car parts, ect. Next, useing computers is very helpful to the human race because it will effect students school, parents/guardians/teens. It will effect and lots of schools are useing computers now and exspecialy students to do their. It effects parents, beca use it will sucess them in life and help them find jobs, with their jobs. Finally their getting enuff exercise because their going to bed, their eating, they go to school, work, or do something for the day that involves walking. Nobody just sits home and does nothing those days. Theirs always something to do or a place to go. Well I hope you think about what I told you and take it into consideration. Thank you for your time, and just remember your job is done on computer too.

Dear @CAPS1, People use computer all over the world, for one reason or another, but they are very necessary in our world. That is why computers have a good effect on people today. They help us contact distant family members. Kids rely on them for studying or homework. Adults need them for their jobs, like sending emails or typing a proposal. Thats why computers have a good effect on us. Like me, many kids have family across the ocean or just across the country, either way, contacting them is tough. Calling them @MONTH1 be expensive in most cases and sending letters certantly take to much time to reach them. With email, the message will be sent quickly and free. You can also have conversations through email with no problem. Another very effective way to contact family is through skype or a web cam. This way you can see your family from miles away in the comfort of your own home. Computers help kids too. Kids like me always have homework on the computer. It could be typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure, either way they both require a computer. Sure, there are books to take notes on people, but do books type up papers? Kids and teenagers can also use them for studying. I constantly use the computer to practice spanish buy using a website with worksheets a flash card to help me. Computers nbot only help kids, they help adults too. MAny adults in @LOCATION1 and othe countries are business men and woman. They are constantly sending emails, typing proposals and all those things. And without a computer all that would be very challenging. Business men are not the only ones doing that though. My father, an electrition, has to sned out emails and documents about his latest project several times a week. Aside from work, we use them in our everyday lives. For example, ordering clothes and toys, but most popular is doing your taxes online. It is quicker easier and that is why @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 finish their taxes online. Computers have a good effect for people of this age. Not only i sthat my opinion, it is also more of a fact. They help us stay connected with distant relatives, help our children stay on top in school and help our parents and other adults in their jobs in everyday lives. Not only are they helpful, but they are necessary and I hope your agree with me.

Dear local Newspaper? Today i am wrinting this letter to you on computers. I belive that the people who don't have computer's have the right to say that people are online rather than exercising. My three topic's are they teach hand-eye coordination give people the ability to learn, and allow the people to communites. First, the computer's are'nt just for talking about! It gives them to learn hand-eye . If people were to belive that computers are just for fun. They would teach you how to type and take some lesson on typing without looking on the keyboard. Secondly, it gives the people the ability to on other cultures or where a is . @PERCENT1 out of the american popoaltion people are online. learning, and the @PERCENT2 are online job to be online. What about little kids? Where the . I'm sure they're buy them educational games for online. Finally, it gives ability to . With other people. If theres a school closing a delay you don't know that you would like to get as a . people the ability is check-out on what's going on around the world or checking for the weather. These are my reason why i truly belive that people should be online atleast twice a week.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 don't have an affect on people because you can play games, webchat, and watch hilarious videos on the computers. Also, you can use the computers for a research project or you can use the @CAPS2 for some facts on @CAPS3 people like @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Also, who would want to get of their @CAPS2 and exercise, exercising is so boring and lame. Second, who would like to especially enjoy the nature, walking through the woulds is so boring, you'll be walking through mud, ticks will be all over body, mosquitoes will try and bite you when you sweat. When kids get older, they mostly don't want to interact or spend time with their family, they want to spend time with their friends everyday. Also, they mostly want to use technology to. Kids will spend time texting on their cellphones when they're not in the mood for calling. Thirdly, computers do give you hand-eye coordination it teaches you how to type without looking down at the keyboard. Computers also teach you how to set you fingers on the home row for the keyboard. Finally, @CAPS2 really do benefit society because you can use this technology in middle school, high school, and through college. When you get older you'll be learning more about these kinds of technology. Also, kids could teach their parents how to use computers if their parents don't know how to. Teaching you parents how to use @CAPS2 is a great responsibility for your actions.
<START>

To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @ORGANIZATION1, almost everyone has them. Computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 they are also a way of communication. I believe people using computers does benifit society because scientists use computers every day, to make the plans to send a ship into space or to keep progress of an experiment. Computers help people stay organized. A lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends. Some people belive people spend to much time on computers. That @MONTH1 be true, but also remember what its doing for society. When people spend less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice. Its not like their being obliged by the @ORGANIZATION1.

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society.

Dear local newspaper- I understand that computers are becoming more of a "must have" in peoples everyday life. I believe this is a great thing! If you're on the computer you type which helps improve peoples hand-eye coordination. Also, you can learn more about people, places, cultures and much more. Lastly, you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people. To begin, I think having computers is a good idea because it helps people improve on their handeye coordination. My cousin @PERSON3, who is a big time baseball player, used to have trouble catching the when he was younger. He kept trying over and over again and never gave up. Then, for his birthday his parents bought him a computer! He was so excited, but when it came to typing papers, he wasn't the best. Not only did he practice baseball but also typing. His family realized that buying him that computer was of the best ideas. It improved his baseball career (by throwing and catching the ball) and increased his grades in school. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one that has gained hand eye coordination from computers. A recent study from yale college shows that @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer for atleast a month gains some sort of hand eye coordination. @PERSON1, a teacher of the computer class at high school states, "@CAPS1 freshman that I get in my class tells me that computers have made their sports careers easier because they now have better hand eye coordination." Computers have two things in one, you learn to type and help your hand eye coordination. Do you want you @CAPS3 to be lacking that positive ability in life? In addition, computers help you learn more about people, places and cultures. I heard a couple nights ago that @ORGANIZATION2 had an earthquake. I also learned about the powerplant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. How do I know all of this you ask? The front page on @CAPS2.com! But, i'm not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet, so many more have too. @ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @CAPS3 use the computer to do research and @PERCENT2 answered that they did. Does the society really want to take away @CAPS3 knowledge of whats going on around us and our history? In conclusion, people can communicate with friends and relatives. This is great if you haven't seen them recently, or if you want to just stay in touch. For example, @PERSON4, mycousin, just found me on facebook. I haven't seen her for eight years abut now I talk to her all the time. We talk about visiting each other and how our family's are doing. But, you can also talk to your friends too. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 between the ages of eleven and eighteen talk to their friends over facebook on a daily basis. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, says "I think this is a great idea for @CAPS3 to communicate with other @CAPS3 through the computer. It gives them the chance to interact in a different way." @CAPS3 have such a good lifestyle for them, do you want to feel guilty for ruining that? Finally, people have perfect opportunities right in front of them. Computers help improve hand eye coordination and helps you learn. It also lets people interact with others in a different way. Do you think that these golden ideas are bad for our society?

Dear: local newspaper I agree with experts that said that computer shod be used becouse i said that people dos need computers becouse they are important the computers serch fast and people communicate from the computer. People have computer at they houses becous we and they need we need sometime you take minutes a word but is you look up at the computer you will see at a second and thus way we shoud stay with computer and more @CAPS1 need computer thus very important for @CAPS1 becouse some time they do not unother stand sometheng and they looked up in the counter like stolen is we have a homework and we have to know about a important person we have to learned up at the computer those easy. Some people do not have a computer home. But they go to the and for the thing they have to away. I we have to think spend time with a famely. But we have to computer become we have to because we need. Some people games and play. But for important about a home work and some people at theirs. Jobs need computer and most of the need compute like one i wants to be a police officiar and the police officiar. They have a littler computer at there car to serch store and thas important for the police. I know thus moust of famely wants to be together spend time with the famely but we have to abot us future to we need computer that help us and we need the computer for the future. And thas my oppeneang for that a help that you agree with my words.

Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, "I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on." @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!

Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to.

Dear @CAPS1, Computers play a huge role in society. Many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and I think that is bad. Instead of being on computers, I think it would be best to spend time with your family. Exercising and enjoying the outdoors is also a good time consuming activity to do. Studying, school work, and jobs are also important things people should be doing instead of being on the computer so much. Family is very important in life and some people take advantage of it. Instead of being on the computer all day, spending home with family and doing activities with them could be more fun. For example, most teenagers come home from school and go on this computer to talk to friends or play games instead of talking with this parents about this day or anything. By spending time with family you not only learn more about them but you can become closer and be able to talk with them about anything. Nature is a beautiful thing. Sure you can see pictures of nature on the internet, but! is is not the same as the actual thing. By outside, and enjoying nature, taking walks, runs, or even hikes, you can get your exercise. Exercising is a very important thing in a persons life, because you need to be fit to be healthy, and by being on a computer all the would happen. Adults, and even some teenagers have jobs in. While some jobs involve computers, most do not. No one can get in job by spending all day on the computer playing games. I talking to people. Teenagers well and do while playing game talking to. Computer are all the time. There are plenty of important activities, such as, spending time with family, enjoying nature, and school work and jobs. Computer are not necisity. We lives, so I think use should using them

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 tired, lazy people sitting on their computer and wasting their life bacause of it. The issue to with is do you think that people are spending to much time on the computer or not. I strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer. And, here are @CAPS2 reasons why, people are spending less time exercising, people not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt you probably know that exercising is at least somewhat helpful to life, @CAPS4 if people are sitting home @NUM1 on the computer with no exercise, it is going to cause people to gain an excess amount of wait. Because the more they just sit around. And do nothing except the computer. The more they're going to be and the more lazy they're going to be. So they're not going to want to do anything and really it's just a waist of life. And, in some cases it can cause depression. Just ask a local resident who says " @CAPS2 mom used to be on the computer all the time and did nothing with her life," and @CAPS3 she became depressed. And, soon after, killed herself." @CAPS3 more and more people are going to become like. I know that a lot of people like to be outside when its a nice sunny day. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 somebody on that day in a room, with their eyes to the computer screen. Because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 if that was someone you loved. Doing that with their life. I'm pretty sure you would try to do something to help them get off that path. Just ask another local resident @PERSON1 who says, "I remember coming home everyday, and there was @CAPS2 mom, no shades up, pitch block, it was like a dark cave, and she would sit there for hours on the computer wasting her life, and I remember asking her how long has it been since you've gone outside, she answered, its been almost two months." @CAPS4 I know from @CAPS2 family that there was a family member of mine who was a "computer junkie" And, I remember at a family get together @CAPS2 aunt was the only one who could never come. Because she was to busy on the computer. And, she

@PERCENT1 of all people in the @LOCATION3 have computers. This number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer. It help us communicate better get imformation quicker and entertain us. Computer have a very positive effect on us. With the invention of the computer, more and more people can communicate quicker and eaisier. For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, @CAPS1 you have relatives who live across the country, you could use webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world. You can learn alot more about other countries culture and other cities way of life. Finally, @CAPS1 a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, the relationship just gets better. The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet you can findout how tall a maple tree is or , how to lose weight. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities nature walks and new and exciting excersises. When students need information on a school project, they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it. When the computer came, people could plaly games, watch @CAPS2.V. and movies, and do business. @CAPS1 you missed you favorite @CAPS2.V. Show you can go online and watch them. @CAPS1 you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, e-mail comes into place, and you mail will never be slow. And finally, you can play many, many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination. With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. Theres information quicker, communication better, and entertainment better. All of the search were in a very good world.

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you want people to be so memorized by a computer that they miss out in the world around them? @CAPS1 you want the kids in @LOCATION1 to spend hours each day on the computers playing games while they could be outside getting fresh air? The question then is, @CAPS1 computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is bad effect. People constantly use the computers teach them bad habbits and can search inappropriate things. IF people are always playing games the computers then when @CAPS1 they go out for a jag. The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in @LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, "@CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out." But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, you know it you've wasted the wrote day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really and you don't to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get air. As you can computer can mesmorised a lot so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on bad habbits. For example, kids are always. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people dont use the. Too much and get too used writing like that. Then, kids @MONTH1 start doing that on writing in school and most even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to. learn your. Lastly is very easy for people, even to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words ad pictures and no one would ever know. people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to no easy to inappiopriate things. So go and limit the time you on computer.

Dear Local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you feel about computers? Are they good or are they bad? I strongly believe that computers are bad and people spend to much time on them. I'd much rather spend time outside where I can excercise; @CAPS3't you? Computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending time together. Finally, computers can be very dangerous. People could be lying and you @CAPS3't know it. To start off, computers take away from excercising and spending time outside. I know if I had to choose between looking at a boring computer screen all day and going out for a run; I'd choose the run anyday. Computers don't keep people fit and healthy so they should find something else to do instead. I've observed that the average teen spends @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. That's @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours they could be excercising or playing outside. For example, walking the dog, or kicking the soccer ball around. You see, there are many things you can do other than going on the computer. Further more, computers cut into quality time with friends and family. I know you can video chat and instent message them, but @CAPS3't you rather spend time with them in person? Too many kids are on the computer so much they don't know what's going on in their mom or dads lives. Theres is a lot of things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer. They could play a board game, watch a movie, and much more. I garentee they will enjoy these activities more then staring at a computer screen for @NUM5 hours. Finally, computers are extremly dangerous. People have been killed because they don't know who they are talking to. Kids go on myspace and put up pictures and posts, but they don't realize that everyone can see what they said. Once they put something out there they cannot take it away. It's also dangerous because it someone is applying to a school that school can see what they put up and can decline the person from college. I hope you agree with me when I say computers are bad. They keep people from excercising, spending time with friends/family, and are very dangerous. In my opinion we should get rid of computers in every house.

The importance of computers in the modern world. Computers now and days are popular thecnology now and days computer are a bigger calculator.

Computers, one of the daily things we use and @CAPS1 with. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers! I love computers but, I as a teen know about managing your time on the computer. You cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer. The amount of time wasted on your computer could be the time you might be outside haveing fun. Theres lots of things you could do outside! As for some exsamples: @CAPS1 come ball, run around, go to the park, go exploring etc... Friends and family are very entertaining, I have lots of friends and I love them all! If you have some spare time you should hang out with them and have some fun, go to the mall! I always go to the mall with my friends insted of playing on the computer for hours on end. So get of the computer and go @CAPS1! Have some fan in the sun today.
<START>

I disagree what people say about computers. Likewise of corse they teach hand eye coordination. But they are not good enough for people. Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people.

Dear, local newspaper people @CAPS1's lot of computer that have help us with are planet. Like not letting us dive are cars for stuff. Learninging was easyer for every one with computers too.

Why we don't need-in us cars sometimes if you have a computer. Like some people have desided that can have @CAPS1 own busniss so they us the computer to make one. Then if you don't want to waste time driveing to buy a te-shirt you can just go on the computer and buy one. Next the more we drive the more polution git in are atmisphier. If we did not have computers are planet will get @PERCENT1 more pulluted. Each year. Now do you want that to happen to the world? Last, we wont be wasting gas on are cars because we are using computers. If the computer was taken away people will still choose the lasy way and just drive cars. Learning is easyer for every one with computers like we don't have to look in a book to find something. Then @CAPS1 different learning programs to teach us a different language. Like for lots of people have college for people who did not. Last, it can help us do are homework if we have on it. I realy my second brain, it has . Now lot of.

Hello my name is @PERSON1 @CAPS1 and I am going to enforce you that computers can benefit our society. First, @CAPS3 allows students to easily get good grades on projects and reports. Second, You can make online job applications. Lastly, computers allow people to chat with other people. Firstly, the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports. They help children's reports because for example they are doing a report on "@CAPS2 lincon" they have access to look up the peron to get information they need right at home. Doing reports with their computer there is no need to use up your projects you can also look up information and print out pichers to make your project more vibrant and eye-catching to younger people. Also @CAPS3 allows you to type your information to make @CAPS3 look orginzed and neet. Accordly, if you are trying to find some job applications without wasting your time, just look on the internets. This way you want go to place not knowing if jobs are available and seeing none. Also @CAPS3 save your to save the trip out there. You are able to look up the paying of the job and regulations, and you can find out if you get the job fastered. Lastly, @CAPS3 allows socializing. For example like facebook or/and myspace lets you talk to friends from school or friends you met online. For adult who don't have a myspace or facebook account they can use email, msn, aol, aim/aol instant messager, or via chat. This way adults can catch up on work and children can kee in touch with friends or/and family. This is why @CAPS3 think computer with internet benifit our society projects, reports, job appicatrone and spcializing with family and friends.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, everywhere you look technology is being exercised and it is beneficial to many aspects in our lives @DATE1. Many engineers strive to improve on technologic devices popularity, while others use it in communicate or relax. study conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 university, the computer is the most largely operated machine. The computer positively contributes to our education, economy, and entertainment. As i mentioned before the computer is beneficial to our education. An example of this is the school i attend, middle school. Here at we have over @NUM1 computers in use throughout the school day. These computers help the students complete research papers, typed assignments and other teacher requirement papers. By using the computer to complete research papers students save hours of scanning through books in the library and money on reading books. In addition, computers teachers in organizing files and entering grades online so students can check their. This is beneficial considering the amount of and assignments graded each week. Moreover, a computer called the "parent portal" allows the students to stay connected with school events that would not be mentioned otherwise in all, computer are way of. Besides education computers touch upon our economy as well. Now, due to the wide variety of computer selection, a computer is affordable, starting at prices as low as sixty dollars! This is a positive aspect of the computer because currently the has been enduring the economy since the depression in the. Consequently, the reason has made families start to cut many useful technologe devices out of the. However, since the price of computers decreased purchase have stimulating. Also, the computer has mainly improved methods of. Instead of listening to a cd player you can download listen to while chatting online with friends. This is very helpful for last-minute plan changes, because for those who do not own a telephone, communication @MONTH1 be, negatively affecting your time of entertainment. In addition, children can use internet in order to play games to take that mind off of a hard day at school, or an adult's rough work computersin producing the you watch at home on the couch and the videogame you ordered off of ebay. From facebook and myspace, to and "gone with the wind." Computers create a relaxing entertainment opportunity.

Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are giving bad effects on peoples lives. Instead of using your time wisely and getting active outdoors, your'e inside your house on the computer playing games or chatting with your friends. If you're those people who easily get overweight or in any diabetic medication right now, I't easily recommend you to do workout or go and invite a friend over for a walk at the park. That way you are enjoying nature, talking with your buddy instead of doing it online, and you'd also be getting exercise. If you didn't notice, you are also doing your friend a favor too. Not only are you getting good benefits on the outdoors but so is your partner. Getting more active @MONTH1 even bring your friendship or family bond even more closer. You might also improve your self-esteem because you'll look in the mirror and feel great about your new, healthy looking body. Also, if you're one of those people always depressed, feeling lonely, or just in a bad mood, this advice could be the key to your solution. The workouts and activities helps you have more energy you never thought you'd have before. if I were you, I'd stop being lazy and actually enjoy your life and not waste time doing lazy then go.
<START>

The effect's computers have on people is not resinable for children and other people. Computers are not good for people these day's because people are spleeling all there time' on the computer and are'nt realling that it miss up there eye's and some people are adicted to it. Now people are useing the computer like they are nutting. So people think that the computers aren't hurtful to there eye's the time people are speeling on the computer they can be speeling time with there family and friend. People helpful is on the line with this computer thing. People shouldn't be useing computers like they are because all day on the computer can mess up your eyes and that's what people are not understand there day. I think that it should be a limeit for when people go on the computers.
<START>

Yes, I believe that computers benefits society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn and lastly compoters are apart of todays technology. First of all, computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have. Computers have helped todays life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didnt know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likley you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where its located or anything else abot it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say your going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the adress and the internet will give you directions. Even if you dont know when your favorite to show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefits society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well, because one of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about christmas i found her on facebook and now we talk and catch up because we havent seen each other in years, @CAPS2 alone tak to her. Another reason why is that if someones mon or dad is away at war or oversea's then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, skype, yahoo instant messenger, with the webcam or the telephone just @CAPS2 alone just typing back and fourth. You could also just use it for a job buisness to talk to your co-worker or one of your workers on webcam to see things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technollogy has come a long way. For example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use. Today you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font and much more. Another reason why is with iphones or i touches now you dont have to be at home you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to. To find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza but technollogy has come a long way. So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didnt knew before and finally computers have changed a lot and they are apart of our technology.

In my own opinion I think that people should get less time on computers more time exercising, enjoying, nature, and interacting with family and friends. If people spend time on computers they will not get off and be stuck on computers then spending time like going to the park, or the mall. For my second opinion that people should not get off of computers because it they ever leave somewhere far they are not to be able to contact you. If you on the computer you could get a computer that say's a free labtop then you could take it far like: On a airplane to north carolina, or virginia, or wasington @ORGANIZATION1, or a party, or a road trip, or on a ferry boat to the long island sound. For my third opinion that I agree people should not be off of computer because they might plan a trip to a far away place or a new house, or planing a anerveriry, or a new spot for a hunny moon a gorgest place like ona peek hill or at a hotel with a bed shape like a heart. For my fourth paragraph that I agree that people should not be off of computers that the count a location than person house or a location where they might be for that particular spot where that person is. For the fifth paragraph that I agree that people should not be able to get off of computers. I tell you why planning a birthday party for there child, or going to someone house for a visit like to tennessee. Or going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to see a basketball team and @CAPS1.S a another team and they are call @CAPS2 @CAPS3 lakers us caverlars. My conclusion is that people should not to be able to get off of computer.

Dear to @CAPS1 this @MONTH1 concern, Computers do a whole lot now of days. You can play games, do homework, socialize but don't you think there are better things than that. Such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly interacting with family and friends. These are all the things that computers take away from people. Once you get onto a computer you never want to get off. If you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. So if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight. Computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising. That is not good for your health at all. Exercising gives you energy and is good for you. Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? When your on the computer chit-chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what your missing. Everytime I use the computer I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature. Trees, flowers, plants, grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't apreciate those things. So next time your on the computer think about that. While your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. Would you like to be that child who doesnt have a family or any type of friends? Lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen anyday. So I believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends. Even if its just having a conversation do it, maybe it can show them that you really care. In conclusion, I think that computers are a waste of time. I understand how people say it is used to comunicate with people but back then they didnt have computers and they communicated so we can to. Computes make you spend less time exercising, keeps you from enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family and friends. You won't go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 are you? As for me I am fine. I am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons why I am writing this letter is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places, computers helps you leran more about different parts of the world and also computers helps people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. First of all why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places. An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places. And they cannot have a good contack with them. But if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the @LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in @LOCATION1 you could have a with I have families that lives and @LOCATION1 and it is hard to them. But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advices. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new resipie and you are not sure on @CAPS3 to make it. And it will give you the inderigant and direction to make that food or snack you want. That's why I believe that you and all others should believe that computers have a positive effects. In conclusion why you should believe that computers have a positive effect is that people could contack with friends and families, computers helps you learn about different parts of the world, and also computers helps you learn and understand more about life. I would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people. That's why you should believe that computers have positive effect on people.

Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I have recently learned that the paper has decided to write about computers and how benefit society in @LOCATION1. I am writing this letter to say that I agree with how computers benefit society. @CAPS2 first reason is that computers help people educate others. They allow people to learn about hand-eye coordination. @CAPS2 final reason is computers allow you to talk online with your friends. There's a lot more in store so keep reading on. @CAPS2 first reason why computers are good for society is computers help people learn about things. To start things off computers are a great way to help out in school because it's a quicker way to get an education. For example a computer helps you study for a test with information websites like @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS2 second reason why computers provide a good education is computers help you do your homework. For example when there's a major essay due the next day, you can go on a computer and type it. It's quicker and a lot more productive. I remember this one time when i had to write a final draft for an important essay and it was @CAPS2 last day to do it. Since it was @CAPS2 last day to do it the first thing I did was to the library and type it what would have took me an hour to write took me half an hour to type. That all hear I'm moving on. @CAPS2 next reason why computers help out in society is computers help learn about hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is something that must people have, but for those who don't the computers help out in many reasons. @CAPS2 first reason is computers help learn yoga. Yoga is something to help take away stress inside of you. Computers have online video's that help you use it if you don't have the time to actually go. @CAPS2 final reason is that computers help out with sports. Sports are something that everyone loves to participate in and something that everyone likes. Computers have videos that show you how to play sports and enjoy them as much as you do in real life. I'm going on now. @CAPS2 last reason why computers help out in society is you are able to talk with your friends online. @CAPS2 first reason why you can talk with your friends is a website called @CAPS2-@CAPS3. Myspace is a website that's all about talking with your friends. It has grown extremely popular in chatting. @CAPS2 final reason is online dating. If you want to start dating again you can always start online. It allows you to start a new life without leaving your room. I should probably start rapping things up. Now that you have heard all of @CAPS2 reasons for why computers are helpful in society I should rap things up. Having computers in life is one of the most usefull things you can have. You can talk to your friends, learn handeye coordination and get an education. As you can see computers rule. There's so many more reasons but this is just one mans opinion who knows what other people think about them.

Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people. Since I have two computers and one laptop I have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer. Everyone should have computers, because you can look up different things, you can play games like checkers with the computer or against somebody else, and the last reason @CAPS1 that you can chat with people from different states and even countries, because I know everybody likes to talk to one another. Everyone should have computers, because you can search different things. You can search places and people. Basically, you can search anything on the internet @CAPS3 you are on the right website. One time I wanted to go on the web and look to see @CAPS3 there was a in @LOCATION1. I went to ask.com and typed in "@CAPS1 there a in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1? It said yes, and then it showed me a @CAPS2 of information about. It told me the address the phone number and the name of the manager. Looking up places in sometimes. Everyone should have a because you can play any types of game. You could play internet game checkers, solitaire and even freecall. @CAPS3 you don't any types of games you can always go on gaming just games up there. Since I use the computer everyday onto all. When I was six years old we a driving game. Since I did not the website all I got to play was checkers on the computers but one day logged onto it and played my first driving computer game. Everyone should have a computer, because you can chat with people. Instead of always using your phone calling and texting people raising your phone bill, why not use your computer and chat all you want without wasting minutes on your cell phone. I know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone. Instead of doing that just go on the internet find a chatcom and start chatting or bloging with your friends. One time I ran out of minutes on my phone and I didn't have internet. I asked my dad @CAPS3 I could use the computer. He said yeah, so I went to a local chatroom on the internet. My friend had an acount there so it would be easy for us to talk all we wanted. I joined in and we chatted until @TIME1. In conclusion I think everyone that likes to look up places, play games, and chat should have a computer.

Computers are intresting peices of technology to work with at home or at work. Some people might think that computers are a waste of time. Also might not be useful. Or that the computers don’t have anyway of helping you. Other people think that the computer is very helpful. People should be happy about the computer invention. What do you think about it? Your wasting your time on the computers! Thats what you hear your parents say all the time right. Well, kids dont really wastes their time if they are on the compter because they could be writing up a paper for a class. They might be playing on educational game on the computers. Even if they arent playing a game or writing up a paper. It is still making them learn some thing. Some people might say that computers are useless, but that is not true. When you are writing a paper for an @CAPS1 class. You would want a computer to help. It has a keyborad so it gose faster when you type. Instead of writing the word out. It also has a grammer check. That is to help you spell the words out correctly. This is why a computer is a useful thing to use. Computers dont make things go faster. But yet they do. They help you find information about many things on the internet. Also if you had to look up a person for a school project. I think you would find more things about that person that you would in books. It really close make things go faster. Computers do help you. There not a waste of time. They are useful to every one. They also help things go faster.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people haved used a computer to learn new things such as cultures. Computers effect people in so @CAPS3 positive ways. They changed the way people think and how they look at the world. Experts even say how computers change the way they act at home and in the public. @CAPS6 also helps speical learn how to read and spell. A lot of people have used computers to learn different cultures. Which has helped are society in @CAPS3 ways. By edcuting youth so they don't make mistakes such as racial ways. Computers helped people learn things besides racial ways in the past but also about there own culture. Which has been proven by @ORGANIZATION1 news. People state that computers have made citizens lose there daily exercis. But people don't only use the computer to study they also use @CAPS6 to find different @CAPS4 different diets and ways to strech there body so they won't hurt themselfs, less than @PERCENT1 studied that the computer diets and different if themselfs to in The @CAPS5 times has said, "The computer not only help our fitness, but also help stay in know our @CAPS6 keeps our world by one little click.

Dear, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I think that although computers are very helpful to socity.

Computer junkies what are they? A computer junkie is someone who woke up in the morning at @TIME1 and and stay on it for a good past @NUM1 hours this is a problem that @PERCENT1 of are @CAPS1 youth have topic @MONTH1 be not be big to but it is a problem must know my brothers addict to his laptop he spends hours in his bedroom watching anime japanise cartoons and not eating anything the whole day. Never leaves his room and my mom get so tired of trying to drag him out of his room she just quit and it gets annoying after a while a little computer isnt bad but alot is. Obeasity is a growing problem in are nation and computers arent helping infact computers are making matters worse by having items being shiped to them of in extent of the obesse person getting up used and leaving of they could lose a little wieght and now you can order offline and have it deliverd to your door @CAPS2 @CAPS3 market such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5 domino @CAPS4 and @LOCATION3 jade have been a part of this issue stop online @CAPS3 ordering. The computer is a great way to learn about things but it also a great way to become a junkie and fat:

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also family that live far away, they also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand and even allow people to learn about far away places and people. First of all, computers have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away. For example half of my family live in @LOCATION1 and my mom uses internet to communicate with them. Secondly, computers have a positive effect on people. They allow you to do homework that cant be done by hand. Such as essays that have to be typed and can't be hand written, and projects for school. Lastly, computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I first came into this country, I didn't know much about it, so I did some research and learn great things about it. In conclusion, computers have an effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away, they also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand, and even allow people to learn about faraway places and people

Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a @ORGANIZATION2 student and I hear that some people think it is good to use computers and others think that its a waist of time. Well I have @NUM1 good reasons as to why computers are good technology. One reason is you can book places that you want to go or the sights you want to see. This is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route you can even print a map and go hiking. (hows that for excersing). Another reason why computers are good to use is because of online chats. Let's say that you have a family member that lives all the way out in @LOCATION1 and they have a computer and you want to talk to them but it costs you to talk, you can e-mail. This is a good way to use the computer because you can stay updated on what is going on with your family members. Another reason is learning. You can learn about many different cultures. You can learn about different people and how they live their life and ther cultures. My last reason is the @CAPS1. This is a great way to use the computer because you can keep updated on the lafest things like the earthquake in hati; or a hurricane or a @CAPS1 breaking story. Or if their is a storm headey your way. In conclusion, using the computer has great ways to be used and sure people, put some bad sights out their but if you use it the right way it is a good source of technology!

Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most kinds would perfer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore, they don't enjoy natire like they should, and they spend less time with family and friends. If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day, seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exersize? Well that's the problem you don't get any exersize. Some might disagree with me but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count! A recent survay has been conduched and @CAPS2 said that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer @PERCENT2 are over-weight or indanger of being over-weight. @CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @CAPS2 is ruining poeples lives. I go in the computer @CAPS1 too, but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now what about the beautiful things in nature @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on, some of us have @CAPS3 seen a day-lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day. This a facinating are might @CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance tecknology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know, that some will disagree by saying, "but i am saying the rain forest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website." @CAPS2's true you are helping but doing @CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better. For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park. The most important thing in life is family and friends, technology should @CAPS3 get in the way of that. If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have? Loving family and friends of course! If family is so importand then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer. Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents? That could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family. I might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world! I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but, I think technology is ruining some peoples lives. If you think about @CAPS2 a computer is like a @CAPS4-@CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating byt when you get the full force of @CAPS2, @CAPS2 traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people's health! All of us should get more exersize, spend more time in Nature, and be with family and friends more often than sitting on a chair glued to a computer screen.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are " Society friendly" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say "@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the "@CAPS14" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in "@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial. Thank you for your time.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think it's a good thing that people spend so much time on computers. One reason for this is when you type you learn hand-eye corrdination. Another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things. The last reason is because you can do things in seconds on a computer that would normaly take hours. Hand-eye coordination is an importand thing: for example you're walking down the street when a baseball flys at you, your able to cach it because of all the time you have bin on the computer has taught you hand-eye coordination. Their are lots of ways to get it, like playing sports, writting, or just playing with your thumbs but learning to type is by far the best way because you'll use the skill while you'r a kids and an adult, @CAPS3 trouble paying your phone bill? Guss what you don't need a phone, why not use your computer to call people sensa its free. Also you wont really need a cell phone because you can do everything that can do quicker on a computer anwway. Last of all its harder for poeple to steel or you to lose a computer as to a cell phone. Have you ever got upset when treing to look for a peice of in formation in a book? Well you can be done with the hours of looking if you just use a computer, then you can get outside, and play games. Most of the time it takes me hours to do my homework, but is I had a computer it probly only take me minutes to do it. So for hand-eye coordination, having trouble with bills and it takeing to long to look thing up by other means I think its good that people spent and i hope you agree.

Alot of people have different ideas on if they believe computers benefit society. I for one believe that computer are useful for many things. The first reason why I believe this, is because one a lot of schools will need them for students, to do projects. Second they have computer gamed to help kids learn. Third I believe its a good way to just relax. The first reason why believe computers are good is because many kids in school will need them. In school we have a lot of projects that we might need type or get a picture. If we didn't have computers there would be no way we could do that. Also if we do persuassive waiting pieces. We would need a computer to type it to make it looks better. Many people might say we could all just write it out. But I believe that typing it might be faster and neater for some people. The second reason why I believe computers are good is because they have many good games to help people I know that have many different games text not readable Computers are good is because it's a a good way to relax. Aint of people get home from work or and are very tired. But instead of just going and sitting on the couch for the whole night you could go to the computer and do a fun game for a little while. Many people say that watching tv and going on the computer is the same things. But if you play an educational game once in a while it might be ok. But then you can do something fun on the computer every so often. In conclusion I believe computers are good because one many kids need them for school second they have a lot of educational games. its a good way to relax.

Do the members of this well-known and captivating newspaper think that the effects of people owning a computer are good or bad? Well, if you think negatively about computers and how they effect people, I would like to politely disagree. I'm certain I could sway you to agree with me too. Computers are positive for many reasons. The internet and other resources can be used for school, work, and other questions, the computer gives people something to do when otherwise they have nothing, and it allows people to talk to others online. There are many great effects computers have on and for people. Everybody has questions, wouldn't you agree? And more often than not, people don't know the answer right off the top of their head. Research is the key to answering questions. But who has time to go to the library and spend hours searching for an answer that would take a matter of seconds to find on the computer? Not every student, employee, or other person can spend that time looking for an answer. There are far too many other things to do! The internet on the computer allows people to find an answer quickly. This can actually improve people's knowledge, and their performance at work or school. You can see here the positive effects of a computer. Have any of you ever been bored? I'm certain that you have. Everyone gets bored. Instead of sitting around doing nothing, people can go on the computer and to many activities. Contrary to some people's beliefs, this can be an excellent way to spend, not waste time. There are all sorts of educational games and mind-buggling puzzles to do on the computer. I'm certain you can see how much better these things are than sitting in front of the. The effects are positive, because your brain is challenged, and your boredom has vanished. Also, hand-eye coordination can be greatly improved by doing activities. These are so many positivities about the computers effect in people's boredom! People have friends, and it is only human to want to keep in close contact with them. But what if a close friend moves away? You don't want to lose that friendship right? People can write letters to each other, but that can be time consuming, and show to delivery and response. And the positive effect of a computer is it allows you to keep in contact online with friends and family instant messaging and email. both great resources for talking with others. Computers can keep friends together and save families from drifting apart. It is also good for couples or parents to keep in touch with their partner or children if they are away. These are all positive effects don't you agree? As you can see, I feel strongly that the computer has positive effects on people. It's good for research, it's something to do when someone is truly bored, and it enables friends and family to stay close via online communication. I strongly urge you to change your opinion from negative to positive about the effects of computers. Everyone can choose their own opinions. but I know you'll prove wise and agree with me!

Dear, Newspaper People should use less time on the computer because it effects their lifestyle. Instead of using their computer all the time they shoul exercise hang out with their friends and family and just enjoy nature. First of all computer's can bring a lot of obesity to the @LOCATION1 because it bring lazyness and it makes peole not went to exercise. If people start to exercise at least around @PERCENT1 of lazyness will go down. They should at least go out for a walk instead of using all their electrity. Also around @PERCENT2 of your electrity bill will go down if you go exercise instead of using computer. Secondly people need to start enjoying nature insteed of being on the computer at the time. People should go green and start recyling and not worrying about what somebody said on "myspace" or "facebook". Also if we started recyling and worring about nature @PERCENT3 of the earth would be greener. My last reson being their should be more friendler family time enstead of computer time. Computers just make you break away from your family and friends because your worrying whats happening on the internet. @PERCENT4 of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends. In my conclusion these are my reasons being for people so they wont use the computer so much and so they can just kick back chill with your friend and family, exercise and enjoy natur

Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exersice, they are not spending enough time outdoors and the dont spend as much time with their family and friends. Exersicing is an important part of one's daily schedued. I have a friend who exersices everyday. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends anytime on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her compleate oposite. He hardly ever exersices and spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabeties and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exersice and too much computer time. Experts say that people should get at least @NUM2 minutes of exersice every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at @ORGANIZATION1 show that @PERCENT1 of kids under the age of @NUM3 are obese or at the risk of becaming obese because they are not getting enough exersice. You don't want that number to increase do you? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend @PERSON1 spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science poject because she was on her computer, rathern than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor @PERSON2 is a child phycologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, @PERCENT2 of them said computer. This shows that people on computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high. Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face to face time, not just video chatting with your friends on facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend @PERSON3 didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get together, she was ostrisized because she didn't go to the reunion. High @ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @PERSON4 says that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are ruined because kids dont spend enough face to face time with their friends but are on the computer. These are all god reasons why less time on the computer and more time exersicing, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier.

Dear @CAPS1 of The Local Newspaper: @CAPS2 students are promoted to higher grade levels, more teachers will require research papers. In my opinion @CAPS10 a computer helps me complete my research paper and the contents in it are the best it can be. What makes students and parents more happy to see @CAPS3's on their child's paper? Advances in technology. there should be advances in technology because they teach hand-eye coordination, it gives the ability to learn about far away places, and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. To begin there should be advances in technology beacause it teaches hand-eye coordination. In a recent poll seen in TIME magazine, it showed that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers had a large increase in their coordination, people were not @CAPS2 clumsy and poorly coordinated. @PERSON1, a professional tennis player @CAPS4 that, "@CAPS5 I started using a computer, I always, would play tennis for living and it was a bad choice because I was poorly coordinated. I always missed the tennis ball in matches. So I decided to stop. Then I started to use the computer more and my coordination improved. Now I barely miss any tennis balls." @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve and teach hand-eye coordination. Another reason there should be advances in technology is because it gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. @PERSON2 @CAPS7 a writer from @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 that, "People like to research a place @CAPS5 they go on vacation or a buisness trip because they would like to know more about it." Not knowing anything about your vacation destination is like not knowing what's for dinner tonight, it is clearly unreasonable. Recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination the more enjoyable it is. Thus, the more vacations they go one which is profitable for airplane companies. Also knowing about the different cultures of the people in far away places gives people a better perspective of the world they live in. Thus, @CAPS10 advances in technology will give the ability to learn about far away places and people. Furthermore, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. @PERSON3 @CAPS8 the creator of @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that, "@CAPS10 online chat programs will help people communicate with each other. @CAPS9 has been beneficial to everybody. For example, it helps people re-connect with their former friends. It is also very beneficial to students because if they forget a homework assignment they can log onto @CAPS9 and ask a classmate." A recent article found on @ORGANIZATION2, showed that online chat programs helped people communicate with each other. @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. In conclusion, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve hand-eye coordination, teach people about far away places and people, and allows people to talk online with other people. When voting on this decision please take part and support advances in technology, it will be beneficial to everybody. Thank you for your time.

Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physicly, and mentaly, @CAPS2. @PERSON1, my aunt an former physisist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, @CAPS3 because of these new ideas involving phones and i-pods are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into commiting a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like? My brother learned swearing from the new & advanced game of @CAPS5. It's a fighting game (@CAPS6!) I implore your company to make the righty decision and write to help pull us off of our butts and get us up and going strong again. I hope you take my advice, and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort.

Dear Local @CAPS1: I'm sitting at the couch thinking about what I should do for vacation. I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to do same creative writing, but my notebooks are all scattered, I don't know how to quickly contact someone who could help and I have no idea about the country that I plan to visit. I take a last look at my notebooks strewn about the closet looking very much like a tornado swept through and I find solution on the highest shelf my laptop. First, I highly agree with the people who think computers are useful. Three effects they have on people who use them usely are fantastic. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop @MONTH1 be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances a part, so they use e'mail and @ORGANIZATION1. They travel places with people at their fingertips. However a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people. Their schedule could be chaotic. Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective. Take my story for example. My mom hates wasting, so instead of me driving to a friend we @CAPS2. Saves money and time! In addition, I happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks. I've written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling all over my room. What organizational tool could help me in this situation? Why a laptop of course! One laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze. Anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer! What you a room notebooks that you buy of, or a single, computer with tons of space and back up? You tell me. Computers encourage users to be more organized! Respectively, computers are resource for a millions of pages information. They're similar to libraries. But think about a library and then imagine a computer. One you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some @MONTH1 argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org' and'.gov' and even'.edu'. These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research. By using computers I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial. They have effectively made me more intellgent as a person. In conclusion, it's my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects, and these include money/gas-saving conversations through @CAPS2 and email organization and increased intelligence from reading. I've decide to take my creative writing on my laptop and in doing so learned the storm.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that you have asked people to tell their opinions on the effects computers have on people. In my opinion computers do not have a good effect. The reason I think that is because kids are on the computer instead of doing their homework, people do not exercise as much because they are always on the computer and they do not spend as much time with their family and friends, @CAPS2 are many kids that go on the computer all night and never get to doing their homework. I read an article that said, "Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework." People get @CAPS4 distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes don't do their homework because they get distracted on the computer. I interviewed a student in the @NUM1 grade and she said, "@CAPS3 class inastly gets all homework done but sometimes we forget when we are on the computer. That is really the only reason we don't do @CAPS1." @CAPS4 computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of @CAPS1. But that is not the only bad thing about them. Since people are always on computers they don't get out and exercise as much. Instead they sit and play games on a computer. I found this quote in an article I was reading "@CAPS5 since I started spending a lot of time on the computer I have gained weight because I am not out exercising," Exercising and going outside is a very important things to do but people cannot do @CAPS1 if they are always on the computer. Nine out of ten people say that @CAPS5 since they started going on the computer a lot, they have not gone outside or exercised in a while. I interviewed a women and she said, "I had to not go on the computer for a while because I realized that @CAPS1 was not good for me and I needed exercise." People get @CAPS4 distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore. @CAPS2 are still some reasons why computers are not very good. Spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do, but with computers people to not do @CAPS1 that much anymore. In a magazine I read @CAPS1 said, "People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging." Computers are keeping people from spending time together. Nine out of ten families say that they have realized they don't spent as much time together because of computers. I interviewed some kids and said, " I don't spend a lot of time with family or friends. I am mostly on the computer instant messaging." Computers are deffinitely not a good thing for families. Those are the reasons why I think computers do not have a good effect on people. Kids are on the computer and don't do their homework, people do not exercise as much and they don't spend as much time with family or friends.

As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has a extremely positive effect on people. Computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer are; teach hand-eye coordination. give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last hit not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explaine more about what a positve effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just ga off and playing video games on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. when you use the computer there os so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a in your socical or history about the country or and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand-eye coordination. First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skills, you should try to look at the computer screan. and not be working down at you finger keys. Not only is that not helping you hand-eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truely is unbelievable. Are you one of those people who's parents don't you get a phone because use of how much it costs without even the cost of texting? Well if you are, the computer help you out with that problem aswell!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use @CAPS1 to instant your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The comp. is so hanndy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w/ hand-eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the comp is a in every household.

Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have an bad effect on people. I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up. I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adult to. That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effects is just helpful ness.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is they help make every day life easyier. First off, you can chat with people from long distances. Also, it makes home work, and finding information a lot easyier as well. Last but not least when you have nothing else to do, you can play games, and watch videos from online. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with @CAPS1 friends. Even if the are across the country, you can still chat with them, for free! Also, if you can't get in touch with them, you can send them a @CAPS2-mail, and as soon as they log on, they will get your message. Best of all, when you forget to write your home work down, you can go online, and ask one of your friend what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is make a word document, and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer, and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it teaches hand-eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games, that any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easyier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes home work much easyier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when there bored, or have nothing to do. I strongly belive that computers have a positive effect on people, because of all the things they offer, and help us on. Thank you.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive effect on people. Spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so important that have throuhout school teaching us how to type. we also use hand-eye coordination is loaded and. You have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the. Computers are helpful in many ways. Have you ever about what looks like or what would be found on it? With a computer you can. Comuputers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get pictures some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who lies there. Yes, you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life easier. Computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. They give you the oppurtunity to talk with people online whether the world the street. In order to do this you need a web. They are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. Its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country. Its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spanding to much time an computer and not on exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. All of these things should be. All you have to do is manage your time. Or not all day on the computer. If you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created. I would like to thanks all f the reader for there time and hope hat you all support me and my ideas.

North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, @CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly @CAPS2 realise to another way for people communicate. Hand-eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the @LOCATION2, that revolves around sports, hand-eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand-eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas. Well how in computers help with with hand-eye coordination yoe ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand-eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dont they need as meen of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand-eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects.

Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1 over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1 about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on an computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook. There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped. In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus. The next day @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as mcafee. and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cought by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend more then @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for @PERSON3's @CAPS7! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About @PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, "clickety, clickety"!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION3. Who knows, it will definetly be an experience, for sure.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you really think we should'nt have computers or @CAPS2 you think we shouldn't? Well I say we should because computers has everything you need as in info, games, school, websites where you can by clothes. Others say no for some reason why they say it's not good for you and to addictive I clearly think that it is appropriate. Having computers, it absolutely helps us learn, whatever you needed to learn a computer has it. If you wanted learn about other places besides the one you live in you could find it on the computer. I remember one time when I was looking for a word in the dictionary and they didn't have it and I looked it up on the computer and they had it I thought it was magnificent. I love computers it connect's me with my family that are in far away places there's nothing better than that because you could talk to your family all day or wherever you want. Computers have everything, any info you need get it off of the computer. It let's you stay alert on what's happening today in the world. It really does work on your hand and eye coordination. "@CAPS3't that brilliant?" Some say computers are not good because people are not enjoying nature. Or people start to not to want to get out of the house, you don't spend time with your family, because your so addictive to it. Some say your not exercising or nothing so you get too fat, or too skinny and your not healthy at all. But i disagree, that's why i @CAPS2 not like righting this side of the story."@CAPS4 kidding." @CAPS5 you have a chance because computers are the best they are definitely not the baddest but after reading this you could'nt agree with me more so it's @CAPS5 to agree or never to disagree. The big question is what will you choose! This is not a hard decision to make.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 reading your paper weekly and @CAPS2 up with local events, I was able to retrieve the information of a contreversy dealing with the effects of computers. I for one think that the computer was come to be one of the greatest inventions ever created. It was @CAPS3 changed our Society, and if you ask me, in a very posotive way. My first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses. You can practically discover anything in the blink of an eye, as opossed to a book or going to the library; which is very time consuming Not only does a computer take for less time to get information, it also holds a much large amount of information than a library can store. Computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable, but best of all, its right your fingertips. Another great characteristic of the computer, is it's ability to let people @NUM1 miles apart converse freely. This might just be the greatest thing about the computer. Chatting online completeley erases the hassel of @CAPS4 phone bills and carrying around cell phones, You can speak with friends half way around the world with no cost to you, amazing!!! The one thing that is faulty about the computer is it's overusage by children although this is a significant problem, it is not the computer's fault. Kids should no the limit. There should be @ORGANIZATION1 for both being on the computer and for excersise and fun with friends this problem has most likely influenced many to com to dislike the computer, but you must understand that the time children spend on the computer is entirely up to him/her or the parents. In @CAPS5 I hope I have persuaded you enough to agree with my thoughts and to give the computer a chance, im sure you'll be satisfied.

Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to eachother. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along. His buisiness transfered @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh-air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vaction. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vaction because they don't know about the country or place.

To the local Newspaper, I think using computers does not have a negative effect on people. I believe it's an advantage to use it. You are given technology, advantage so why not use it? They give people chance to chat with people allow them to make friends. These days people even watch to shows on the computer-websites such as: @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 allows them to search anything and watch it on @CAPS1. People make emails, download music and several other things. Children at the age of @NUM1, @NUM2 even @NUM3 move use computers-play games on them. i have a cousin who is @NUM3 and he plays games on it all the time he even knows how to search something on the computer. Some people @MONTH1 think it gives you a negative effect, but really it doesn't. Those people think that should comee to the reality. We have to step up as the life goes. Let's say a girl doesn't have a computer, her parents think that computers spoil children, their technology spoil children. The girl goes to school, her friends asks her to give them her e-mail. Every time her friends asks her about email she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject. this time she made an excuse, but how many times is she going to make up an excuse. Then suppose one day her friends finds out she doesn't have a computer and embarasses her in front of everyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that you have to see around you and go on with it computer also saves your time. You can just type instead of writing whole out. You can make your writing cursive or any other that you would like. After reeding my letter, I hope you understand my point. Next time you see a person who thinks computers give negative effects to people, tell the advantages of the computers and how it benefits society around you.

Although many people love to be on computer palying video games and have cyber chats, most of them don't know how bad a computer can be even though I experience a great time on the computer, I know how bad it is. Here is a short example. You can experience problems with your computer, if you stay on the computer for to long it can over heat and that can cause it to stop working. Another problem is side effects. you can get headaches from just staring at the screen for to long. Those headaches over time can become even worst. You @MONTH1 even get poor vision from a computer. Computers can also be addicting. Because of your addictition with computers you @MONTH1 become less close with family or friends, causing your social life to be very minimal. Also, because of the addiction, it @MONTH1 work its way to your daily routines causing you to have to play it daily and more thatn the average person does. Your personality @MONTH1 also change with your social life and routine. Lastly, computers can be very dangerous. if your child gets on to one he @MONTH1 accidentlly link heimself to a dirty or bad websites. He then to the negatives of a computer. On a computere your child will probally be shown things like words to pornographic features. These are all things that should not be allowed to access on a computer. Computers are addicting, they cause problems and are dangerous wrong in my opinion should be stopped. Now you think we should do about computers.

Dear local newspaper, I think the effects of computers are good. Some reasons I think this is that we get a lot of knowledge from it, contact people you don’t live near and haven't seen in a while. My first reason why I think the effects of computers are good because you can get a lot of knowledge from it. One example would be if you want to make a @CAPS1 meal, you wouldn't find it in an ordinary @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you would have to look up on the internet for the recipe. Another example is if you wanted to travel to @LOCATION1 by car and you didn't have a map how would you get the directions? You would go on the computer, look up directions to @LOCATION1 and print it out. You would have never been able to go to @LOCATION1 if you didn't have a map or a computer. My second reason why I think the effects of computers is good is because you can contact friends or family that you have not seen in a while. One example would be if your sister just graduated from college and you wanted to congratulate her but you were @NUM1 feet in the air by a airplane and all you had was your laptop and your luggage, you would e-mail her saying good job. These are just a few reasons why I think the effects of computers is good, and I hope the local newspaper agrees too.

Do you want your child to suceed in life? This is why computers are valuable to everyday life. Computers help children get more education, they can be independent and not hows anyane tell them new to use a computer, and @CAPS1 they get to college they can take notes quickly and not fall behind. This is whycomputers are important to everyday life. Computers are important because your child will get the proper education that they need. @PERCENT1 of children who uses the thev internet for students for studies are the ones that will be a grade ahead of the best of this or her classmates. Dr. @PERSON1 a computer cope it, says, "@CAPS1 I was using the computer to do research on a topic, I went on on leperdy the @DATE1 and from there I was a @NUM1 @DATE1 because I was on the computers. As you can see computers are valuable items used in everyday life. Computers are important to everyday life because it helps your children be more independent and learn how to use different parts of the internet. @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 of children who use the internet are most likely so succeed in college because they know what websites to go to and how to get there. There is an @PERCENT1 chance that the children who succeed in college will get the higher paying jobs because they've @PERSON1, the computer expect, says, "@CAPS2 son was at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 was smart because @CAPS3 was always on the computer looking up new facts and ideas that popped into his head." @CAPS3 is a student which is very hard to get. This is why computers are valuable to everyday life. Computers are impotant because you can look up sites that will help you eat health foods. @PERCENT3 of adults who health foods are most likely to live an even @NUM2 years of their life because they are their bodies in health conditions because they've eating more fruits, and drinking more to keep their bones strong @CAPS1 they fall @CAPS1 they older. As you can see, using then internet can be very helpful if you used to the right way. This is why using the internet will help you be the successful person that you want to be in life.

Dear who ever this @MONTH1 concern, I think that people spend way too much time on computers. They do not exercise as much. People sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy nature. Family's and @CAPS1's are spending less time together because they have computers to talk to each other. Computer's have become a negative influence on people today. People need exercise to live. It keeps us healthy. With all the fast food places pople need exercise more now than ever. People do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on. A staticstic is @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 each have their own computer in the house. They said "I would much rather be on the computer than outside" (@PERSON2 @NUM3 grader at @ORGANIZATION1). Even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer. Human only have so long to live. There is beautiful nature outside. We do not enjoy our surrounding because we would rather be on th computer. For example @PERSON1 would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 students enjoy nature every week. A young girl about @NUM6 never apperciated nature until her parents made her stay in a month. She now loves nature. because it got boaring day after day on the computer. Family and friends are huge parts of our life. We want them to be apart of our big events. Because of the computer we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event. But would it not be much better for them to be there, @CAPS4 you on when it is hapenning. When I was around @NUM1 @CAPS5 grandparents used to come to @CAPS5 soccer games, but now they dornot because @CAPS5 mom just records it for them to watch. I liked it so much better when they were at the soccer games, @CAPS4 me on. "@CAPS5 family and @CAPS1 are the ones I want at @CAPS5 events, not to just show them after the event happend. A @CAPS6 is that everyone wants to share their event with the family. Computers aren't that great. They make it so family and friends do not come to see you. Computers take you away from the beautiful nature that surronds us. It limmits you on exercise and makes you gain weight, which is unhealthy. I urge you to use your computer less and exercise, see family, and enjoy nature.

I think that computers are because you can have arthridis in your finger, loss of vision, and you also should go out side to get fresh air. It is not good to sit on the computer. Because you can get arthrits in your fingers. There is also a deises called carpel tunnel that when you can really grasp anything anymore. My grandma has arthrites in her fingers but it is not from the computer it from doing dishes all the time. But when she does somthing she complains that her fingers hert. So I think @CAPS2 she is doing dishes I think the key bored will do much more damge and will effect you for the rest of your life. My mon always tolled me that @CAPS2 I sir in front of the @CAPS1 to long I will go blind. Well in a magesen it said that "@CAPS2 you sit in front of a @CAPS1-computer for to long it will parshel blind you. so @CAPS2 you sit in front of a computer doing face book or somthing whats the differents that will parshel blind you. It is good to go out side somtimes to get fresh air or go for a walk those are someways to stay in shape because @CAPS2 you get obeses then you will die @CAPS2 all you do is sit in front of the computer you need to get exercise every day to stay fit and health that is the way to be in stead of eat junk food and drinking soda. In sure it's ok to go on the computer @CAPS2 you look up other health stuff to do. What im geting at is it is good to go on the computer somtimes but it can be very unhealthy to sit infront of it. @NUM1 you need to be healthe to stay alive and @CAPS2 you sit infront of it all day then the results wouldn't be good. Those are the resons why I think the computer is bad to sit infront of all day.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the years computers have gotten faster smaller smarter, these advances have led to mankind as we know it advancing, but the effects that come with @MONTH1 be non profitable to the youth of the computer world. Some common effects computers have on people, mostly children are, preventing kids to play outside, tbe active, computers prevent people from using their immagination they also are a waste of time. Everyday a child across america will use the same old exuse, "no mom, im not on facebook, im doing my @CAPS4 report", while infact they haven't even started it, or they hours ago are now goofing around on line, but ask your self. "did this happen thirty years ago? no your parents who grew up then were thrilled to an outside when thire assignments were compleated. They could not wait to get on that flaming red bike t go play ball with joey. Kids these days are becoming less active t egar to play outside f people blame obbisity on genetics while it probbly should be blamed on computers, sucking children to them. Because kids never want to leave the side of their beloved computer to go outside they are using less + less of their immagination. parents tell storys of when they would watch the one new episode of their favorite show + what whole week the kids in the neighborhood would take roles + act it out. but do you see that every day in this generation not at all. No one that or imaginn any thing new about it with friends to make it more fun they only move onto the wii five minuets later to play a smashing ballons game. Computers just up all of your time the average kid will spend up to four hours on the computer just falling around with no purpose. Wasting the time they could be improving homework or walking the dog the time is not bring donated to a good source. it is not being effective most times. they say computers are the now generation but dose that mean that the now generation must be, lazy, unimmaginitive, and not care what their time is put towards. Most people will say no we are not but you offer a nine year old to play on the computer or, oh say go outside! You would be ignorant to think they would go out to play. People want to move forward but can we not make a compromise?

Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. It was extremly exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Proffessor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worriying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waist @PERCENT2 of there spare time on their computer. If technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is likey for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said "I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. Its been quite sometimes when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. " @PERSON1 later mentions " it's kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature." Not only is excersicing time headed down the drain, but our used to be " beautiful" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials there parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1. Since adults aren't doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. The kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremly off the wall; our nature is going from beatifu to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official has survey @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and roleizing the beaty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoughly breathe in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minuests, a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be nessicary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old an I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very known to our town but I have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents stand me in my house as they use the computer. The other day I just found out what "show" is because my moms computer brake and now I am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature? Its sadi how @PERCENT3 of these reasonings are caused by the excessvive use of technology and computers. Let's just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are very important to some people. Everyone uses them or has used them before. It isn't bad to own a computer because you can still excersise and be able to do the things you do everyday. Lets say that you need to look something up, the thing you always go to for information is a computer. People in schools, industries, and in homes use it all the time. Teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games, I know I do. It's so they don't waste their time being bored all day. Excersising and being active is indeed very good for teenagers to really look into, but even though they do that, they don't push away the computer. It will always be there when they don't have anymore homework or when they finish running around the neighborhood with their friends. I can't imagine what my life would be like coming home from soccer practice and done with my homework and the computer or @CAPS1 is one of the first places I run to so I can just sit back and relax. Computers should be known as our friends. They won't hurt us. They just give us what we need and want. Reaserch is a good example because everyone uses the computer to find whatever it is that people are looking for on it. And if they're done with reaserching they can have a little fun by games and friends. But I believe that the main purpose for computers is information. Whenever I get home from school, I finish my homework and stretch a little for cheerleading then whatch @CAPS1 or go on the computer so i'm not bored. It's not that i'm not active because I'm not working out or excersising. It's because I have nothing to do, so why not make my time occupied? Everyone does it so I'm not the only one. Yes, computers are just this square box with a keyboard, but if you don't push it away from peoples common lives than you can see that they aren't what you say they are and they won't rot peoples brain or anything. The reason they are in an office or living room or bedroom is because people like them and uses them for their needs.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do @CAPS5 do when @CAPS5 need to write a report? Or talk to a buisness partner, friend, or family? @CAPS3 computers help us do all of that. The eletronic wonder improves are lives everyday. Yet some people refuse to accept computers are now apart of every day life. Computers help us communicate, research different topics, and have just plain fun things to do. Computers make it easy to communicate. Things like "@CAPS2" and "facebook" let us talk with each other. Some @MONTH1 contest "@CAPS3, use a phone or go out." @CAPS1 if they're away on a trip, or live thousands of miles away? With computers everything is easier. Computers allow us to reserch topics @CAPS5 need for classes or work. "@CAPS5 can get alot of detailed information from thousands of sites. Sceptics might ask the question "@CAPS6 not go to a library." Some of us might prefer to stay at home. Another reason is, that it maybe snowy, or the library is closed. @CAPS1 ever the reason, computers make reserch fast and easy. Computers also fulfill a great need to entertain ourselfs. Games sites like "facebook" have become very popular. They can provide us with emotional release from the everyday world. A pontential argument might you "@CAPS6 go outside?" The weather could for bad and your sick. Computers are fun, education and a communication wonder. should find the good in computers and @CAPS1 they could do for there.

Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive affect on society because it gives a lot of information, it has lots of fun games and music, and it informs you about issues in the world and communities. The first reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because its gives you lots of information. If you need to do projects and research, what better way to do them than on a computer. You can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and people that made a change in the world. You can also look @CAPS5 and study different kinds of plants and animals, and you can find fasmating experiments to do. The second reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music. You can go on the @CAPS1 channel website and play lots of diffrent games from your favorite t.v shows. They also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your @ORGANIZATION2 such as comprehension clinic. The computer also has lots of music that you can listen to. You can listen to @ORGANIZATION1's album. I am @PERSON1 before You @CAPS2 it, or @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 before buying the @NUM1 songs. The fina; reason I think that computers have a positive effect on society is because it gives you information about issues in the world. You can go on a computer and search @CAPS5 natrual disasters like @CAPS8 earthquake, @CAPS9 earthquake, or information about the tsunami that @MONTH1 hit @LOCATION2. You can search @CAPS5 @CAPS10 @PERSON3 and get information. You can search your favorite artist and see what their albums gonna be like or you can search @CAPS5 issues in your community. That is why I think computers have a positive affect on society because it gives information it has lots of games and music, and it talks about important issues.

Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are beneficial to our society for example, computers are very helpful to everybody. Computers alsi travel nows faster. And they can teach us new things. I am not saying computers don’t have their downs, but, computers also have their ups. Computers are very helpful in many ways. They help people find lost fmaily members, and they help police officers find many criminals. Haven't you lost soemone in your family, or haven't spoken to them in years and always wanted to find them and get back in with them? Well that's what computer are for. Aslo haven't you been concern about the many criminals on the street, and wanted to get them of the streets and in jail where they belong but didnt have a way to do that? Computers  help. Haven't you notice that computers are  help police many women in the present time? Computers  people in the , but they help travel fastre for example say you heard there was hurricane or tornado and you needed to find out how . All you have to do is on the computer and look it up. Also, there an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and the didn't information to help you. You would just go on the computer and find all the information you need. COmputers are of many things for they you. Computers teach you alot, like hand-eye cordiantion. Think about it, you might on hte computer that, but it helps. If you yourself while you are on the comp[puter you would start to see that you are typing fastre and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now, then when you saw your first computer. Computers though, not only teaches you hand-eye cordination but it also teaches you of many wonder places. Such as @CAPS2 falls, rain forests etc. Now, dont get me wrong, @CAPS3 not saying that computer dont their downs and that people dont take advantage of computers. but, I am saying that they help society alot. They travel news fatser. Also they taught alot to people. So take my opinion into consideration. And think about how much computers have done for you.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a @ORGANIZATION1 who believes that computers have a positive effect on people for one computed help promote hand-eye coordination. @CAPS5 there is the fact that computers also help teach people about distant places and people without leaving they're home. @CAPS6 computers also allow people to talk to each other via the @CAPS3. What would we do without computer! My fist reason why I believe that computer are a good thing is hand-eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye @CAPS4 you have to watch what keys you are using when typing, your brain builds a connection with your hand, thus better eye hand coordination, "@CAPS5 there is the fact that millions of @LOCATION1 are in car acidents a year, wich @PERCENT1 are cause by the fact that the driver of a vehicle had to look down at the whey to make that they kept thier car. On that road, this being that they have no eye hand coordination, @CAPS6 I that it computers were in the of every person in the world there would be less acidents a year. Secondly there is the fact that a computer can transport somebody in there mind. to a distant and or person. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT2 of people surveyed can find information on the @CAPS3 faster than they can in a @CAPS7 there is the fact that a child of any age can use a computer to find the specific information it needs in a matter of seconds. @CAPS6 I have observed that children know how to use the @CAPS3 but not a dictionary or encyclopedia, @CAPS6 there is the fact that people can contact and talk to people through the @CAPS3 for one this allows you to contact a long lost friends. @CAPS5 there is the fact that you can talk to theme @CAPS5 @CAPS6. There is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your @CAPS3. How cool is that @CAPS9 reading this letter and sharing it to your company I believe that you should support my cause. This is @CAPS4 computers improve hand-eye coordination, link people to other people and places and @CAPS6 allow people to talk via the @CAPS3.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, "@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything." @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living.

Dear local newspaper, I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far away places: and people have educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First of all computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. When I was in sixth grade I had to do a project on @ORGANIZATION1 didn't know anything about him. But, luckily we have computers so I was able to @ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wodd or information on him and got an a plus on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade I had to do a project on @LOCATION1. I went on a computer went on @CAPS1.com a get lots of imformation and got on a plus. The second reason computers are benefitial to the society is because computers have educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 saids, "@CAPS2 percent of the computers websites are educational. I also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on @CAPS3. com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time. Last but not the least, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. Theres a website calle myspace.com and it allows me and other people to talk online around the world. I asked my class and ninety percent of them go on myspace.com. On the other hand the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. Theres a website called @NUM1.com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven. Now, you know my reasons, why computers are good to the society, they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, have educational websites, and even allow people to tlak to other people online. What is your choice in these actions.

Dear local newspaper I've come across this letter I saw about the technology of computers and how it's affecting people lives. I think the computer is a great of learning. It’s a new way to study and do other things to learn in a fun way. My opinion is when you have to for a test, quiz or anything if can become boring. I like to study in a fun way that will to my head and I want it when is the computer to have I learn alot from the computer when im at home. my mam & dad think i spend alot @CAPS1 I do sometimes but half the time im studing test. Now i would like to the time to talk about is mentally when you go to learn. Physicly preasure or everything to You can learn different as well just log on to this has to choose them. Lastly family and friends. Family and friends are important websites like @CAPS2, facebook, aim and @CAPS3't that cool. Thats the beauty of computers and technology letting you do alot of things with only using on device. Thank you for giving me the oportunity to say my opion and what I think. I hope you take my letter and into consideration.

Dear @LOCATION1 news paper I have over heard this debate on weather computers are good influinces on people or not. I am sending you this message to state my opinion on the matter and in my opinion I think the computer has very good efects on people. Not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments. There are many reasons why it has a good effect on people but the first and maybe one of the most important is it is an amaizing learning tool. When people are on the internet they could learn just about anything they want to on the giant mass of information we call the internet. It not only dose this but people learn how to do things through simulators from flying a plane to driveing a car. There is even more learning ability on the internet because a lot of people get home schooled on it through the internet and this @MONTH1 be an important part of their education because they might not be able to go to school because they are alway on the road or they move a lot of whatever their reason is. The computer is an important part in the invancement of the people's education. Not only can people use the computer in education but it is used as a tool in many ways, lets say your making a movie and need special effects they will use of photo shop or you need to collect and store changing information like lets say you want to stack you can always or down on a computer. Even if you were a construction worker you could your blue prints with pinpoint accuracy. Another less important thing about the computer is it gives many people entertainment. Lets you come home your bored you have nothing to do play a video game look around on the internet, it is also an important way of getting their music and or videos. This also effects many buissness and if the buissness go under becaus people werent moving ther stuff a lot of jobs will be lost and that is the last thing we need. The government also relies highly on the internet. They need it to make plans, save soldiers, and comunicate with other countries. And last but not the least we have the fitness and wellfare of the people useing computers. All I can really say to that is it is their decision. If they get off they can and if they won to sit there and waste or

Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking if computers benfit society? I believe that computers don’t because you can’t get exercise if youre always on the computers and @CAPS2's really hard to enjoy nature too. Another reason comuters don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family. hopfully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise? @CAPS2's proven that more than half of united states of @CAPS1 is over weight. Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something use that you know is better wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Interacting with poeple is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don;t then you might learn to be shy and not make as much friends as you like @CAPS2's true taht oyu can make new friends over the computer but @CAPS2's not the some meeting them in person. Also if you do make a "friends" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the poeple you like, wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Yes you can play games on the computer but @CAPS2 would be ebtter if you play @CAPS2 with your fmaily. To answer the question everyone is asking I believe that computers don't benefit society at all and hopfully I have encouraged you to believe this too.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, "Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday." @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, "in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it." Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world.

There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors. Lastly they teach us hand-eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries @MONTH1 be inquestitive about where they came from. They @MONTH1 also wonder how other countries are doing goverement wise or even economic (stocks). All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. Also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuaracy. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate. Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. My grandma was in the hospital once and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was to young. Since the technology of webcams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay. Webcams are a could way also in discussions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. If you have a webcam you can talk to eachother on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not. Technology @MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and @MONTH1 be the best one that will ever be made. That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand-eye cordination. Hand-eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired. This is an important skill because it allows you to suceed in life such as having to write. This skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this well payed job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand-eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. however if you get a computer you must update it reguarly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye cordnation. Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would nedd to suceed in life.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people these days rely too much on technology. Everywhere you go you usually see somebody on a phone, texting, on a computer or plugged into an ipod. These people are not necisarily bad, but they are under the control of technology. Computers for example, are in the eyes of most people, fast, easy and fun, but they also pose as a problem. Even though it seems like everybody has a computer, not everybody does. Also people become way to dependent on such matchines that they can become addicted to them. Computers @MONTH1 also seem like they work @PERCENT1 of the time, but they can also be very unrelyable. Just off the top of your head, how @CAPS3 people do you know that use @CAPS4 or @CAPS5? A lot I'm sure. Now multiply that number by itself for all the people they know and multiply it again and so forth. That number shows that, @CAPS6, over @NUM1 million people use these. Now what are the chances that if you sent a friend a message one of these programs (with the @NUM1 million + people on is) that the server will be @PERCENT1 relaible and your pal recieves the information he needs? My point is that, what if somthing important came up that required your friends help, and you could not reach him because of a fault in the system? What would happen You could be at a hospital for a ride home for an hour longer than it should have taken. Another problem is what if you needed a computer, and you specially needed him/her? If they did have one then You have you did it in @NUM3 minutes but how else could you contact them? You could try to call, but what if they are outside and are playing with his/her dog? Also these days if you are really grateful for somthing you go on google and type in virtual thank you cards. If the person gets it then they will be happy, but probly much more so if in the mail they got a handmade real thank you card. My final reason that computers hurt us more than they help is addiction. Like I said in my first paragraph, everywhere you go you see somebody wired into an electronic device. People no longer go outside and play cowboys and @CAPS7 because now all they have to do is hit paly. I will admit I too use my computer quite a bit but at least I budget my time so I can also go outside and play a while. Obeisity also branches from overuse of electronics along with @CAPS3 other products.

Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 you know that computer have been around since the @DATE1. Ever since then, many people have had a better life. Computers really help the elderly out a lot. When they need to pay a bill, they could just log in, pay it and move on. Another thing is if they need to write a letter, but their handwriting isn't that elegable anymore, they could type it, print it, and be done. This way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter. Computers are a fad that will never die out. Doctor @PERSON2 of the @ORGANIZATION1 in @PERSON1 said, "The children I work with use computers everyday to build their hand to eye skills, ever since they have increased that skill @PERCENT1." The corperate from @ORGANIZATION3 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that everyone should have a computer. Computer help you out with projects and I think everyone should have one too. Are you ever sitting home with nothing to do? Well, why don't you go out and buy a computer to play with? Computers can help you do all types of things. If you like to play video games. then you'll love one of these machines. They have all types of game systems out there just for computers. They also have web sites you could go on just to play them. I'm sure most of you like to play games, so why not try it. A basic computer isn't that much if your worried about the money. So go out and buy one. There is a lot of people in college now and mostly all of them have computers. They make research easier and faster to find. Which would you rather do get ready, jump in the car, drive to the library, search for a book, stand in line, and check it out, or, get on the computer, search what your looking for and be done? You make that decision. When college students get stressed which happens all the time, they could turn on music from the computer to calm them down. Computers have changed the world in a good way, and they continue too. You should buy a computer today.
<START>

I belive that computer technology is a positive effect on people. I think this because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and talk to people online. Here are some reasons why. My first reason is because the computer can teach you how to type faster. For example, for the use of your fast writting you can get a good job/career and can have a future in your life. Another example, is because you can type e-mails faster and don't need to type slow. Last example, is that you can improve you typeing skills and become a better typer. My second reason is because you can learn about far away places. For example, you can learn about other countries and how it's different from our country and how their alike. Another example, is you can use it for projects, get all your information and be prepare for a great project. Last example, is you can always learn something everyday from your computer, like news, weather etc. My third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people. For example, you can talk to your friends and family to check in on them and see how their doing. Another example, is when your bored you can always talk to someone on the computer and have fun with it. Last example, is you can talk to your friends and plan when to hang out and go outside and get fresh air, That way you don't have to be in your house all day. That's why I think that computer technology is a good idea because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and allows you to talk to people online. I hope you agree with me also, and should think that computer technology is a good idea for everyday for lots of reasons.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have come very far with technology. Computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther. But the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society. My reasons for this are when you are on a computer you could be cyber bullied. My next reason is that when you stay on too long you miss out on stuff like being with family. The last reason why computers do not benefit society is when you type on a computer the spell check on @CAPS3 checks spelling and puncuation and grammar so you don't learn from your mistakes. These reasons support me in saying computers haven't really benefited society. Firstly, my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is you can get cyberbullied. For instance somebody goes home and checks their email. They get threatening emails. They are scared what do they do. Cyber bulling, being induced by computers, is the easiest way to bully somebody. You can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message. All you really have to do is find out somebodys email. Also cyber bulling could be anybody. Some one you knkow or someone you don't. computers haven't helped in society by inducing more crimes. Next my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life. Between checking email accounts and updating @CAPS4 the average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer. People who spend that much time on the computer miss things. My sister always come, out asking questions in the middle of the conversation because she's following and updating on @CAPS4 while @CAPS2 are having a conversation. People miss things while on the computer. Lastly, when you are typeing an essay or something you don't learn anything about grammar or spelling because spellcheck checks it for you. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1 when texting don't use proper grammar or spelling. So they can write an essay in text language and when typing it over students choose what they mean from spellcheck and move on. This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling. This is reducing students thinking levels just above read and click the awnser. If computers did everything for us @CAPS2 would be mindless slugs quick. In conclusion I think computers have not benefited society. Computers inducieng cyberbulling. When you type spellcheck corrects your mistakes so you don't learn and people miss stuff when on the computer. Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more. Computers should be used less.

Dear local Newspaper, I think using a computer has become bad influence on modern society. When people talk to each other via text message or e-mail there is no emotional sense. You are blind a way because you can't see who's on the other side of the screen, @CAPS1 you know is the username of that person. Its practically the same as using a disguise. Not only is the computer dad for your healthy. Its become a threat to its user. Would you really want to use something that bad toward your health and your privacy? Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of teenangers have access to/and use the internet more than three times a week. Statistics also so that more than half of teenagers in the @CAPS2.S.A spend more than @NUM1 hours on a computers, some even @NUM2 hours! This has become the addiction of the world. My friend barely used a computer and always played outside. When his sister showed him @CAPS3, @CAPS4, myspace, @CAPS5, etc. He would stay on for hours and after a month, it didn't get better, day after day he began to come outside less and less, and I began to hate him fo that. Statistics show that people who are using computers excessively tend to have drop in their grades. People are mixed in to these machines they become anti-social, don't do homework, potentially fail the unit and reappeat the grade. Computers are the same as watching tv, sure! they teach hand to eye coordination but at the same time their brains are being turned into swiss cheese. I believe computers are the best idea, since pouring gasoline on pancakes.

Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you.

Dear Newspaper, I am writing this better to explain to you how more people in our society would benefit from using computer you can do work in less time it would take to do it manualy. You can interact and make more friends by talking or web chating. Not to forget that it is more entertaning. That is what computers were made for. To help us with tasks or for our personal use. How do computers though help us with work? Lets say that you are having a buisness meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs. It would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer. With a computer, you can type you work which makes it much neater and looks more proffesional, You can copy and paste your images that you can @CAPS1 on the internet. With graph making software, you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest. If you had to do this by hand, you would have to write extremly neat, @CAPS1 pictures in a newspaper or mabe, even draw them. Then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up. It makes it twice as hard, to do a simple task with a computer. What if you want to talk to a friend? With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen. Instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them. If you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go. Being able to see the person at your convinience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have. The benifit are major and it doesn't cost anything to chat. If you have a friend or relative that lives very far away, you can easily go at talk and have a video conference. What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable too! but we can fun, we can play games or watch videos at as convinience. They don't cost a lot to download at all, they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself. Videos you can watch all the time with no ads to interupt you can pause the video too. This is more efficie, they care I very convinient for the average person. Playing games were ever you go is good and again don't art to play or. In conclusion I think that people would be more from using computers this is because it is easier to work with. We can interact with each other. Use it for entertainment. Technology was made to make things easier do we should take advantage of it.

Has a computer helped you ever answerd hard question or type up an essay for school for work? I know a computer has helped me far years so why would I teminate it or want it gone. Heres the controversy, many experts believe computers don't benefit society but people, such as myself, believe the exact oppositte. Their are many benefits to oconing a computer such as they're always a source of information, allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, have their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamon. He never found the diamond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. due to a computer he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of. also, computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones, with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication. for example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss, you can even choose what type of handwriting it types. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. Althourgh, some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addition. Still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work.

I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think "well why doesn't the " I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives @NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games. And lastly you want your daughter to go to yale or do you want her to fail. I have give yous you the facts the rest is up to you.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do believe that computers can be positive. If you think about it, they can actually help you learn with all those different programs they have. Say you need tutoring or advice, you can basically find all that on a computer even if you have a little kid with, I'm absolutly sure that they have websites and programs for them, and trust me they're fun and educational! You know how people are complaining that computers are taking away time from exercising, and inteacting with family and friends? Well, what if you have family living somewheres else. You can chat with them! And also do execise while on the computer. I'm sure if you keep reading you'll know why I think they're positive. Having trouble in school? Are they blaming it on computers? Well we can change that! If we're able to prove to people that computers can help us learn and are educationaly then people might actually think that computers aren't bad with all of this technology that were coming up with these days arent that bad. I'm pretty sure that they have some sort of tutoring program, they even have college online! Now theres something to look into. Do you have a kid, a younger friend, or even a younger brother and sister? Are they always looking for games to play? Well I'm @PERCENT1 sure that they have fun learning games and websites on a computer! So, while the're having fun, you can just think of how much they're learning now! It's a real fun way of learning! You can just imagine on what they're learning and how well they're doing on school. Do you have family who live far away that you don't see much? Well if you all have a computer than you can posibily stay in touch! You guys can chat each other, check up on each other, and see how everyone is doing. It's a perfect way to stay in touch. Want to know what would also be a good way to connect, a webcam! You don't have to have one, it's just a suggestion. So that way not only do you get to talk to them, but you can see them too. Isn't that cool? I don't know about you but I think so. Well now that you've heart what I've had to say about how I think computers are positive. I hope you think the same too. If you really think about it, they aren't bad at all. They're actually very helpful. Thank you,

Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers affect our country in a positive way. Three reasons why I think so are comunication, @CAPS2, entertainment and, @CAPS3. One of my favorite things to do is talk and when on of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number I thought we had no way of doing it. One day he requested me on facebook and from there on we have been comunicating on web sites like facebook, myspace and, skype. My second reason why computer's benifit our society is @CAPS2. At my dad's house I do not have a television so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world. A website called @CAPS4.com was the frist to anounce @PERSON1's death befor anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break rest on the internet. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, comunicate with friends. The last reason why computers benefit our society is @CAPS3. Many @CAPS3 in our comunity require computer skills such as a acountant, a manager, software designner, and a computer programer. The computer make @CAPS3 and more eficient by correcting mistakes, providing a visual and typeing. These are the reasons why computers affect our community in a positive way.

Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is great concern about computers and wether or not people spend to much time sitting infront of the screen or not. I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising, enjoying, and being with family and friends. Exercising is a major part of every persons life and if you don't get enough of it you could become obeise. Obeisity @MONTH1 cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don't care what others think, but in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way. exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny joy, go for a walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant 'in person? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn't you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would and I think most other people would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, nature, and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life.

Computers are today a common havar hold item and some people think its bad for socity when in reality its our most useful tool nowadays. It supply's an easy access to information along with preparing skills for future generations. And giving from lifes sometimes to cruel days through gamming. Before computers world spend hours in books and find what there looking for. The computer solves this. This non as simple as typing what ou need to know and hiting the enter key. This improves grades for children and life for adult solving a into the without leving your home and allowing news like yourself to spread into at the moment it's known. It also creates an interactive place for anyone in the world with thing like and or question and answers this allows us not only yo ask opinions and compare responses but to get statistics that @MONTH1 help us make life altering decions. Not only it supply info it also prepare our for the world. With things like children around the world and I social and decion making skills. It also them like web and design as well as simplier things like management and tougher things like business. Along with all that though it gives love an copy. Online video gaming is today a huge maker in which allows people not only for new as they do anything from dance, build, fight, smithe teilor, and so. And this infact @NUM1 of games are ages @NUM2. It also improves at the same time hand eye cordination. So when you have a ruff day tents to brings people happyness. So computers all neccity and put your mind to hard work but @MONTH1 you your dreams with a little well limit!!

It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others.

To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a benefit to our society. These computers are an advantage to our learning and knowledge. By using computers students can get there work done quicker and more efisent. While typing your report on the computer you might spell a word wrong well every computers has spell check. Also you @ORGANIZATION1 need to look up a word because you don't know the deffinition all you have to do si go to @LOCATION1 and type in the word and automatically you have the deffinition. You @ORGANIZATION1 have been given a book report so you can go online and copy and paste @CAPS2 do @CAPS2 no @CAPS2 want let you but @CAPS2 you had a piece of paper and your pen you could write @CAPS2 down. A computer has made the life of a school student so much easier. You @ORGANIZATION1 need a job but cant stand, walk, talk well you could get a job working on a computer. Computers allowed more jobs to be made and replaced. Without a computer how would teachers get mail sent to them without wasting paper. Sure a computer uses electrisity but paper wastes trees. Anyway you think about @CAPS2 the computer is a good thing to invest in. Going to college not everyone has enough time in a day to drive to school, well with your computer you can go to school right online. So if you don't have money to by a back pack you don't need one your mates stay right where you left them. So a computer is a good invention. @CAPS2 has made life quicker, eco friendly and even has saved trees. On the brightside @CAPS2 has even produced many jobs. Last minute things can even be online. Each computer bought has given someone else a new expense.

I beleive that computers are helpful, and useful to us. They provide us with a wealth of entertainment, enable us to communicate with one another, and even help us learn. Today, if it's raining outside, or its too cold to do anything, you can go on to the computer or the computer, you can watch movies, play games, and webchat. The computer is a grat machine, and health expert @PERSON1 sais "computer usage is fine so long as it's limited to about an hour or hour and a half a day". Some people complain that people arent getting enough exercise because of computers. But its not really the computers fault that they arent excercicing. In todays modern world, you can call some one, text someone, or page them with computers though, you can do even more, with a webcam, you can video chat with people, and send each other videos. You can also connect with your friends on facebook or myspace. Sociologist @PERSON2 sais that more and more people are connecting to @CAPS1 websites, and talking with their friends. "@CAPS1 websites are great" @CAPS2 also said "@CAPS1 enable you to talk with your friends when their far away, or you just can't see them. However, nothing beats real connect." Computers also help us learn. They can answer almost any question you have, and have name a lot. Today, most people don't . Some people still might think that computers are bad for you, and they cause lack of excercise, but I beleive people have the to make friends. They choose to over use the computer, and too much of any thing is a bad thing. Computers today are an invaluble of life, and are irreplaceable.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other. If someone doesn't have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @CAPS2 well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also cames in handy when you have nothing to do. If you're bored and can't play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, @CAPS2 well @CAPS2 keep you busy. If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained, you can go on @CAPS3 or other sites and find any song you want to hear. It's better than listening to the radio because sometimes you don't like the song that's giving. If you're also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document or if you just want to type whats on your mind. @CAPS2 you can see, I think the computer is a facinating tool to use. You can communicate, learn new things, and keep yourself entertained if you're not able to do something active. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family.

People the computer is something good and cool. Why is cool? is cool because the computer help you in everything. I have reasons. The first reasons is when in your school you have homework, work, project or something like that the computer help you a lot. Because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side. The second reason is the computer help you in your house for example: You have the big problem with your car or something like that. You can go in the computer in @LOCATION1 and the you see the pieces of your car. The thrid reason for the computer is so cool is because in this time you can make the everything thing. We can go the web and facilitate our life. Now you can realize the work, homework, project, ideas, writting book, chat, information, print picture, and ect... And that you are architect you can make your proper work or house you see the computer is so cool. But some people use the computer for bad thing for example: for pornography or something bad this is not cool and is not appropiate for people. The computer is something fabolous and super genius. My opinion is that the computer help a lot is something like need in our life. No for live but for our life or something @CAPS1. Something you can see your family for webcam. This is fabolous but don't used the webcam for something bad you can learn thing that you don't know. I think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing. Appraise the computer. Please.

Dear local newspaper, Technology is an important part of everyday living even some people's lifestyle without technology, more specifically, computers, mankind would be lost. We wouldn't be able to learn about faraway places and people research things with a wider range of information available or for some people, talk to friends and family. Technology i needed in everyone's life they realize this or not. There is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer and as far as advances in technology this is only the beginning. The internet allows people to learn-and more than just what you would get from a book at the library. You can learn about the culture of @LOCATION1, the food they eat in @LOCATION2, or even the way people dress in @LOCATION3. You can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country. The possibilities @CAPS1 computer allow you to do is research. When maybe they through them giving a presentation much easier! Furthermore the computer enables people to comunicate with others. For some, this is their only way of communication. If you have a penpal in @CAPS1 state, or maybe even @CAPS1 country, e-mail is a great way to talk to them it's quick, easy, and enjoyable tool others, however, prefer instant messaging - the message you type pops up almost instantly on the others computer. Then they type a response and it comes back to you! Either method is a great way of communication! So you see, without technology we would not be able to learn everything we'd like to, research for, say on for language arts class. We not even be able to communicate with some others. And this is only the beginning of what our lives would like without the computer.
<START>

To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping and even enterteinment. Sounds great right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it.

Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe computers can be bad for society. My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers, less time exercising, and lose interacting with family and friends. My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them. I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. Ive been over a friends house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. Alot of @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. Ive seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It's just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends ive spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think "hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or myspce, or facebook! you lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer. Half the time im to busy talking to someone i don't know then helping my little brother with home work, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion these are my three reasons why i think the computer is bad for sivilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think what the computer can do to @CAPS1 I people once again those three resons are one, people are spending to much time on their computer. Two, spend less time exercising. Three, lose interactions with family and friends.

Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @DATE1, computers are a big part of our society. They are an advance in technology, and they have some positive effects. However, computers have more negative effects on people. They take away and diminish @CAPS3 time, interacting with family, and seeing the world. First, computers have a negative effect on people because they diminish @CAPS3 time. People are so caught up with computers, their desire for @CAPS3 starts to fall. According to a @ORGANIZATION3 survey in @DATE2, for @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer a week (roughly @NUM2 hours each day) had an increase in cholesterol and slowly deterioating muscles. "Computers distract people from their needs" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. "@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people get this amount." The leading cause for this low number? "technology," she says, "@CAPS2 computers, which take away all of the motivation and time people need to @CAPS3." @CAPS3 is vital, and computers are taking this away from society. People shouldn't have bad @ORGANIZATION1 because of this negative effect: computers. Second, computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family. @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people say that computers take away from their family time, reports Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. This is not of all good, especially since @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to eat up time, it also cuts of communication, something extremeley important in graving children. with this, family bonds and relationship are ruined as wal. It affects interacting with family, and puts hates in family bonds: computers haved negative effect on people. Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world. When you're on the computer, it seems like the entire world is in your computer screen. But its not. This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notedly become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net. The cure? Traveling, or even talking walks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of their world in which they live. They have to make important descions for themselves, their children, even their country, and staring at a computer screen wont help at all. It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, it takes away from people seeing the world, something actually very important because it affects people's desicion making as well as future generations. People need to realize these bad effects, and majorly decrease their computer usage.

Computers have alot of impact on peoples life! Computers can be helpful and distracting at the same time. I have a computer, but I can only go on if after I finish my homework. I do alot of things on my computer mostly games and social websites like myspce. Computers can be helpful by helping you with homework or find information. I use my computer for homework alot like for project or if i dont know what the subject is about. I also think the computers are helpful by talking to friends or family. I talk to my family alot and they live all the way in @LOCATION1. I go on myspace like five times a week. Computers can also be a distration by making people lazy and have bad websites. Like myspace can be dangerous. If you tell someone all your important information and you don't know them. That can turn out very bad. Alot of people dont even get off the computer. I have alot of family members that only get up to go on the computer or play video games. They don't get off too. There on like for eight hours. My mom also uses the computer to go on @CAPS1. She talks to alot of her friends that she left in @LOCATION1. She still talks to the people in high school, but she mostly talks to her older sister. She's not on the computer for @NUM1. She's on like for @NUM2 minutes to an hour. I think computers can help in life, but not to be on for like eight hours. You'll see what you will turn if you do that every. My cousins are getting bigger and bigger. I don't mean height. So if you do go on the computer not for almost half the day!

Dear newspaper, Technology is a very useful thing But is also a bad thing, it makes people lazy on . A computer is a multi-use tool. Along with this people cango on any website . Anything, as in research or personal reasons. First off, let me point out that computers are useful multi-purpose tools. Computers can also, @CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people. A lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end. Students sometimes go home and strayht oor tug computer instead of doing homework. Moreover, computers can help you pay bills. Do research, or maybe just for fun play games. There is an ulimeted number of websites & to cp on through to hep you with many of needs. Uploading family pictures from your last vacation? its simple with most computer soft . Finally, computers is kind of like one . They can even become a blank just waiting for a pinest of insparation.

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their "computer-time". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you "report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your "computer-time" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, Computers tend to have more negative effects on people, rather than positive. This is true because people @MONTH1 not be getting enough exercise, people @MONTH1 not be enjoying nature to the forest, and lastly, because in this world, people do not spend enough time with family and friends. Computer are good to have around the house, but. To begin, people are spending too much time on computers. They are having more of a negative effect because while on the computer, you are not getting excercise. Think about the a day doing fat because of all the fast food on the computer while eating it. Obeseity now a days is a big concern with the @ORGANIZATION1. Staying on the computer does not help the situation. Any concerned person, technologically challenged would agree the countless ones on the computer are no good for the health of our country. Further more, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough beauty of nature. Many people, adults and have @DATE1 because they are world but there that should be explored and people should be thankful for beautiful that we have still @DATE1. They should be things wait to see it. Although communication is important for everyone, instead of talking on the computer, people should make plans with their family and friends. This idea also relates back to the lack of exercise and naivety of people. If people were to go out and enjoy life to the forest with their friends and family, there wouldn't be numerous hours a day wasted on a computer. People should get off their butts and go. Life is too short to sit around all day. Any intelligent person would realize that computer time isn't as fun as family and friend time. To conclude, computers are and have been very over-used recently. Instead of having problems, lack of sun, and just boring computer talk, people should got up and go. We only live once, and that once should be lived to the fulest!

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 would a person do with out a computer? Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you @MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you @MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way.

Dear, @ORGANIZATION2. A computer is a very helpful resource. It helps people navagate through life, they can find jobs, do research for school. This world wold be nothing without computers. But on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in thier research topic and wallah tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your finger tips. Also a computer can help unemployed people find a job. Its easy, type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also working from home can a lot less tessful. It's less stressful because you dont have to deal with annoying and impatiant co. workers. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers home, @CAPS1 now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office, another day at home. Computers have helped us come along way since caveman times. Without computers this would will be nothing. We woulde have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even bleders. We also wouldn't have the more sifisticated things like fockets. and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers, where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardys? On paper? Where would the goverment store their information? On paper? With those three palces we already cut down half of the @ORGANIZATION1. Computer help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on @CAPS2 or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Lets recap they help students reasearch, help people find jobs, you can work from home. Helps the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman. The @CAPS3 line is that computers are very helpful.

Dear local news paper, @CAPS1 computers is a good idea because every developed country uses computers. Also they @CAPS2 learning, fertileze comunication, and are comercialy implortant. Computors also make life easier for many people. Computers @CAPS2 learning by let vast of information being available. I personaly find out about many world events just by bringing up yahoo.com. Computers alow me to learn about new @NUM1, learning about cultures all over the world can be done by computers. The last way computers @CAPS2 learning is by informing us about everyday thing like to get a stain out, how to pronounce a word, how to make a new dish, and much more. Computers are also crucial to communictaion. We use computers to talk to our freinds on facebook. You can also meet new people useing a pc. Everyone uses computer so you can basicly meet enyone. The last reason computers are important is for the commercial stand point computer help alot of small bussness out by letting than be known. Domestic seller and huge companies can compette for the same customer. Furthermore the internet generates alot money for people becausethey can use it as a cyber billboard. In conclusion the computer is usefull because of learning, communication, and comercial. Therefore the computer should be supported and not looked down upon.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer? Computers have a negative affect on people! You could be damaging your sight, time should be spent playing outside, and it'll make it harder to talk to people in person. Do your eyes tend to hurt when your finally off the computer? Whether or not you playing games or typing articles your eyes @MONTH1 strain to keep up with a small font on a website. I remember the time when I read an online novel and my whole body was ready to go and play. Except for my eyes. Instead of playing sports games on the computer you should get up and play one outside! When your on a computer, your most-likely indoors. Did you knew a person should be be outside for at least @NUM1 minutes to get there vitamin @CAPS3. Your net sustaining the right amount of vitamins you need daily, at a computer screen. Do you ever find it easier to talk to someone on the computer, than it is in person? Your not the only person that thinks that way. If you get off of the computer and talk to one face to face you can improve your social skills. At first it wont be easy but its worth it in the long run. By now you know that computers aren't really giving off a positive effect. There hurting your vision, limiting your outdoor activity time and making it harder to talk to people in person. So come on put down the mouse down and find something "hands on" to do!

Computers do not benefit society today. Computers have made technology a necessity, many people don't spend enough time doing other activities, and they do not benefit your health. Do you want a world full @ORGANIZATION1 people who have their eyes glued to a computer screen? Computers are very helpful to all people but they are adicting. Computers were made to get your tasks done quicker and easier. For example you can shop online and google things. We live in a generation where computers have become a necessity instead @ORGANIZATION1 pleasure. According to @PERSON1, a psychologist at the @ORGANIZATION1, more than @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people, now-a-days, are inside on their computers. Furthermore, computers are making people lazier. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 going to the store to buy things or walking to your friends house to talk, you would typically use the computer to do so. Therefore, people don't spend enough time doing other things. For example, on a sunny and beautiful day you would think that most kids would be outside having fun, but this isn't thet case anymore. For children who are old enough to use / work a computer, they'@CAPS1 be inside on that nice day. There are many nice things to do on a computer, like chatting with friends, checking your e-mails, and facebook. Even though these things are pleasurable, you should limit your time on the computer. Most @ORGANIZATION1 the time that you spend on the computer could be spent outside or at the movies. Not being on the computer could help small buisnesses too. If you pay money to do an activity, or buy something, watch something it would make a difference in the small buisness's profits. On the other hand, computers don't benefit your health. Mac. magazine says that there are health risks when you use your computer all the time. @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people become obese and have vitamind @CAPS1 deficiancy from using their computers so much. When using your computer you could be working out or exercising, and this causes obesity. Also, if you are inside all the time, you wont get the healthy amount @ORGANIZATION1 sunlight that you need, thus you have a vitamin @CAPS1 deficiancy. Another health risk is having bad eyes. If you spend hours a day on a computer your eyes can get permanently damaged. Do you want your child / children to be put at risk for using a computer too much? In conclusion, it is safe to say, that computers do not benefit society today. Many people have an addiction to technology, you could be using your time more wisely, and computers put your health at risk. Although computers do allow us to have an easier time accomplishing tasks, abusing the privlage will have consiquenses on everyone.

Dear local newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise, or even spending time with family. Some parents are less active with their kids. Kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home. Adults and kids are getting less excersize. Sitting down reading or what ever they do on the computer is not excersizeing. They are going to get fat because they eat and sit down and than they get hungery again than eat and sit down. Some people say that your getting finger and arm exsersize by and moveing the mouse, thats not really true. Looking at the computer screen all day can cause masive hand People are also not spending time with family. They are sitting infront or a computer and ignoring everyone and everything around them. Kids could be enjoying other things besides computers. Parents could be outside. Playing catch with their kids or even playing a board game with them. People are not less active. They are not going out and haveing fun jumping around with their friends. Instead they aim them on computers or message them on facebook or even myspace. Kids are failing in school because they fail to do their home work after school. They would rather go on the computer. This is why i think computers have an positive effect on kids and adults.

Dear @CAPS1 In my opinion the computer is the better thing because you can do alot of stuff like play games. My three reason why you should have a computer is you can talk online with your friend or do homework or project and fine out @LOCATION1 things out. Therefore I think if you like doing that then the computer is what you need. My first reason is talking online. People talk online so they can talk to there friend @PERSON1. If you talk oline you can figure out what was homework or whens the meeting or the time the party starts. You can also talk online with your friends or family the moved or lives far away around @LOCATION2. My second reason is doing homework. Sometimes you need the computer to do your homework. You need the computer so you can print picture for your report. You wil also need to type yout report on your vaction. The computer also help you fine the history or @CAPS2 book online so you can do your homework or project. My third reason is finding out @LOCATION1 things. You fine out how old is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or how tall is @ORGANIZATION1. You can also figure out how to spell a big word. You can fine out many hallway can take you to @LOCATION1 or @CAPS5 beach or other places. Fine out where the wall of @LOCATION3 is. In coulsion if you like to learn @LOCATION1 thing or talk online and do other stuff then you should get a computer.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I believe it is true many people use computers and that many more will use them in the future. Computers are a standard of the buissnes world and are hevily depended on. People are even needing internet access on cellphones to stay up to date on stocks, shipments and important emails. Some computers are also just for at home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @MONTH1 need instantly or wouldn't be able to find any were. Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use but then does not mean they will permanently restrict you from othere activeties. It is true some people do spend to much time on computer but not everyone does, some people work from home computer and can not help being on it because it is their job. I implore you to consider the resonse computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help not hurt people. Computers are very helpfull in simplying things and are very useful for information. I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect hte way of human life. Computers do th things people would normaly not do for example someone would not go and look up every thing he or she needs to know in a look because there be only certain facts there looking for and it would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several diferent books. So if you truly think about it computers save us a tremendus amount of time with the things we do. Once again I say "computers better owe life not hurt it."
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper,… I believe that computers have a negitive affect on people today. I believe this because computers cause people to be less active, most people would want to be at home on their computers then out side doing activities. I also belive computers restrict people who talk through it to show emotion. People should be out with each other when they talk not talking throught a machien. Finally if people were not on the computer as much they would bring down the obesity rate of the contry if everyone just stoped using technology for a while and wen outside. Every day at least once or twice or somtimes even more people use the computer for hours on end. People today have so many options of things to do on the internet: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, ooVoo, and alot more. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say they "need" to check these everyday but they really dont. What they do "need" to do is to stop using computers as much and go out side! Furthermore, people all around the world communicate thought the computer. I talk to my friends all the time thought the computer" says @PERSON1, "@CAPS3 the easiest way". Now it @MONTH1 be the easiest way but @CAPS3 also the most boring, I mean really do you want to talk like a robot or with emotion like a person? Computers dont give you the chance to show emotion, this means people need to go out, hans out, and mabye even call each other to talk. At least you getting up to get the phone. Finally, @CAPS4 is one of the most obese places in the whole world. People are sitting on the computer everyday, eating, and not moving at all and gaining weight. Do you really want to be a known as the "fat country"? I dont think so. People should restrict computer usage among themselves to a of an hour even less if you can. To restate, I beleve that computers have a negitive affect on todays people aroung the world. Computers cause people to be less active. less emotionn in a conversation, and cause people to be obese. So please help me fight to put more people outside and make people more active, sounds like a pretty good cause huh?

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am here to talk about my view on computers, about how they help people, and how many people say that kids and adults are spending to much time on them. My first views on this subject is that computers are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on. These past few years, computer company's have been making enormous strides allowing people to do allmost everything. This is both good and bad. A computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home. It is great for people who own a small business, you can easily go online and update somthing yoou want changed in your store, such as designing colorful posters to put on the windows of your store to increase business and to catch peoples eye. You are also able to book flights weeks or even months before you even go to the airfort. This is good for those who are busy and travel a lot. You can go on a website called @ORGANIZATION2 where you can go anywhere vin the world and zoom in on a landmark such as the great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1. Computers can also improve your hand eye coordination when you type. Typing is a important skill to master, if you are a good typer you can do things much more efficient then you would on paper. Some can even memorize the key board and not have to even look down. Computers are also great for communication if you have relatives far away in another state or even country you can easily talk to them through @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is a online service that you use to talk to them in person. These are just some of the things you can do with computer. On the other hand many say that people are spending to much time on computers, and getting outside for execise and not spending enough time with family. I do agree this is the case in some ways. I know some friends who average about six hours a day on computers which to me is to much, also parents become to busy with work that they are on computers, when they should be spending time with their kids. Some kids became so addicted to computers that they might become unhealthy and become obease from sitting so much, this is something that should not happen. I hope you have learned a little bit about the good and the bad about computers, and how it is important not to be on the computer to much, but it can be an important feature if used correctly.

Hello everyone, I have heard how many people are basicly saying that computers are bad. That people are speanding to much time on computers and not enough time outside and being with family. But I'm writing you today to tell you about how great computers really are. First off, computers help technology so much. People can now do things that we could never do before. Things like chating to people across the sea without having to pay for @CAPS1 or even be there. Looking up ways to burn fat fast and diet programs. Uploading photos to share with other family and friends. And much, much more. Computers have helped so many people do so many things! Mostly good things by the way. Secondly, computers have helped us acomplish things that otherwise we couldn't have gotten done. Like go to the moon! Have cellphones! And some diseses were helped cured by using computers. Computers can be a little danguras to some people, who probley don't know how to use them right, but in a few more years all that can be fixed! We are getting more and more advantsed in so many ways, @CAPS1'@CAPS3 kinda crazy! I could go on and on, on so many more things that computers do for us, but there are not enough pages. Lastly, @CAPS1 is more easyer to do reasearch with computers. -And quiker to- @CAPS2 in my school we use our computers for learning purposes, and they help us very much. I've personly, learned a lot from computers. I even use them to get better at math for the @ORGANIZATION1'@CAPS3! We need them! (@CAPS4... I do at least) I'm even starting to learn another language -@CAPS5- with them. @CAPS1'@CAPS3 not to assume that every one who uses them are fat, lazy, and don't spend enough time with family and/or friends. Furthermore, please stop all of this nonsense, I really don't thing that spending to much time on computers is the thing that you should be worrying about right now. That is all I have to say. Bye.

I remember when computer wernt so popular. Back then I had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio. Now computers are very popular. I believe that computers have positive effect on people @DATE1 because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to acess them. You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. Which is good because its much easier. For example im a student that can't draw so printed some pictures of the computer so I can paste them on my post board. So in the other words the computer is useful for students. I know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or its a zero. In this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of intersting because you can up with friend that you haven't seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantaes because you would have nvever thought you will see your friend doing. Another thing about computers that you can fint stuff cheaper than everyday lif say if you want to a trip and you call @ORGANIZATION1 for your ticket. The ticket came up to . But you go on the computer and you on @ORGANIZATION1 website and find your ticket to florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a restion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convince. At home if my labtop is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what to do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to acess one! In this generation everybody is rushing and computers.

Dear local newspaper, Computers are effecting more and more people in the society instead of helping. A boy named, @PERSON1 started to have many health problems afer he had bought a computer. The computer that he thought uses helping him wasn’t any help at all. His health issues started to get worse. He soon started to be out of breath more always have a high blood pressure and he started to become overweight. Since he had this computer he didn't exercise or got out to spend time with his family and friends as much as he was on the internet. Computers aren't helpful, my opinion is that all they is waste time, lose your education and can make you unhealthy. As you @MONTH1 already know computer can do a lot to help you but there are some things that you don't know about computers. According to a health magazine, tests shows that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose @PERCENT1of your brain cells. That's a lot of brain cells to lose when you are going to need them for your education. There is no way to get those back, either. After walking around the streets to listen to what people think about how computers can effect people, @PERSON2, a policeman at the police department had this to say, "I love using computer and going on the internet, but most of the time I act on he computer at @TIME1 and find myself getting off at @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1 can be very unsafe and unhealty. Computers can help you find what your looking for or show thigs that you have never seen before, but it is all a waste of line. Instead of going on the computer to go on facebook, youtube, or myspace you should go outside and interact with your family and friends after interviewing @PERSON3 the best female rapper so far she had this to stay "Computers are okay but they are sometimes just a waste of time. Instead of being on the internet doing something pointless like playing a game you could be stucking far an upcoming test or doing your homework so that you wouldn't be doing it at the last minute".

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that people could use computers all the time and never get off. Well I don't. Think about all the negative things that could happen. Like spending less time with your family, getting addicted, and unhealthy. People who spend all there time on the computer forget that there family is there. For instance, I remember when I was little and I was on the computer and I forgot that i had family members with me, so I missed out on all the fun things like going to the mall or park. Certainly, playing on the computer is fun but woudn't you want to give some attention to your family. Almost @PERCENT1 of people in other countries be very lonely because all they @CAPS1 is play on the computer and forget about other people. You woudn't want to be like these other people right? I never thought playing on computers could be addicted. Lots of people in other countries can't last a day without playing on computers. Some say almost all the people that play on computers all day, day to night have died because they bairly eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. Imagine you life being ended because of addiction on computers. I remember when my friend told me, "don't be on the computer to long you might die," and I thought it was a joke. So think about going on the computer all day and night. Not but not least, some people aren't treating their body properly. For example, some people playing on compters forget about eating, sleeping or walking around. This tends to make people's legs num and make people's stomach hurt alot. Imagine not eating, sleeping and walking around for a day. You woudn't even want to try this. Now is the time to decide, wheither people should be able to play on the computer day to night. Also all the negative things that can happen like spending less time with family members, getting addicted, and being unhealthy. So get right up and decide.

Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, "oh tha's what a phone is for"? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, "People spend too much time on the computers right"? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise.

Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1 press, I have recently heard about many arguments based on computers ruining society. I strongly disagree with this. I think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends. The internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Some people have moved away and I haven't been able to talk to then. Now, with the internet I can able to talk again. The same case with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she ever talked to. Now, with facebook she has re united with them. This also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail, which costs money, unlike email. So the internet can also be a way of saving money. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter. The internet is a great way to keep intouch with friends and relatives. I also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book. If you don't have enough time to go the to a library, you can do some research at your house. What if the library is closed if you do go, then you wasted some time. The internet never closes, it is open @NUM1. What if you go to the library and they are open, but do hot have a book on your subject? This can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet. If you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet. The internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing about every game, there is that you would feel like playing. Also @CAPS1 of spending about @MONEY1 on an x-box and a game, you @MONTH1 only have to spend about @MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer. There are also many websites that have games on them. Some websites are for specific games, and same have many games on them. Only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends. On the other hand, many games are only for one player. As a result, a computer is a great use to play games. In conclusion, I believe the computer is great need for our society. In the long run it will pay off, especially with the economics problems our country is having now, by helping us save money,. It will also allow connection with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Which article title more interesting, "Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race" or "Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race on computer game." @CAPS3, the less interesting title is what your news will change to if people keep using computers. Some effects computers have on people use cheating an less time with family and friends and lastly, most people aren't learning anything while on the computer, they're just plaing games. As you can see, I agree that computers are a bad idea. I bet some people have never thought of this but computers can lead kids, and maybe even adults, to cheating. There are websites on the internet where the user just types the question in, and they get an answer. There is @CAPS4 another way of cheating, copying others work, essays or articles form a website. Some students could be told to write a biography on a person, and they could just copy an article, switch some words around to make a sound like their own paper, and with no guilt. Another can people computer spend less time with family and friends I was watching television and playing on the computer. The wife was very close to because spent the computer helping @CAPS4, there can was always in the on the computers. Because this show I realized that computers kinds anti-social divorce between parents go up. Do you see all people computers looking up facts about things as going on the computers learning. I know that when I have time to go on the computer, I am not looking up things to learn. Most people these days dont care too much about learning about countries, other than their own, or people, other than people they know. I think it's pretty obvious that noone is going on computers to learn, otherwise they wouldn't have so many users on game websites. In conclusion, computers have negative effects that get to all people. So, @ORGANIZATION1 you want to have your news be the latest divorces and computer game high scores? Or do you want interesting news that will keep you newspaper going. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job.

Do you like learning about faraway exotic land and animals? Are you good at sports but would like to be even better? Do you ever miss your family that lives in other states? The computer can help you with all of this but is @CAPS1 bad for you too? In my opion kids and adults should use the computer. When people are on the computer they can learn about interesting far away lands. When your on the computer you can look up some of the natural disasters. For example people could google each quakes and learn all about the people that has lost their life's. The people that they will donate some money to the poor. Children living on their own. They can also learn about all the wonderful beautiful lands that are out their waiting to be explored. Everyone I know likes to the beutiful birds and animal. In their the world, They will be able to do this on computer. The might be so more this lands. Having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get. With having a computer people will be able to talk to their family that live in other states then them. I have a uncle that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see him because a lot of money to come. Somewhere on the computer, @CAPS1 is easy to just send him a message that say how I'm doing. With computer you will be able to talk to your friends cant talk on the phone. For example, what if your friend and did not. She can not talk phone because so what do you do you. This help you her. The last reason why we should have computer. If you let @MONTH1 periods of time then @CAPS1 will help you with hand eye coordination. This will help the kids that play baseball. They will know where the ball is at all times is they will most likely cauch the ball more often so playing a a little bit of video games is not bad for unless one. Using the computer is @CAPS1 good to do or not using the computer helps people be able to interact wild people that so easy to talk to. So @CAPS1 you are compleatly agenst using computer the get up and use @CAPS1 right now.

@CAPS8 more and more technology is being invented, people use the computer to do work and to learn. But more time on the computer is not neccessarily a good thing. People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise. Take my freind @CAPS1 for example. He was a triathlete, who trained everyday so he could be in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1. But then he got his computer. @CAPS1 had suddenly lost interest in exercise and spend his whole day checking his e-mail instead of training. But he is not the only person who has become unhealthy because of computers. Experts say that @CAPS5 with computers at home get only @PERCENT1 of the exercise @CAPS5 without computers get. @CAPS5 with computers also were more likely to be overweight and choose chips over an apple in a study performed at @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1, who headed this study said, @CAPS5 are taught by society that computers can do such wonderful things and educate them. However, they are not taught how bad they can be for you health when used too much." @CAPS6, computers are a problem to our health. Another reason computers are a problem is because they strain you eyes. When my school had disabled people come and talk to us @DATE1, there was a blind lady named @PERSON5, who lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spend too much time on her laptop. But she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers. Scientests at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One of these scientist, @PERSON3, reported, "@CAPS8 more people begin to use the computer, more people seriously hurt their eyes or even lose their vision. We estimate @PERCENT2 of this next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3." @CAPS9, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. A third reason people should not use computer is because they stop interacting with real people. My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. That is, until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven't seen or talked to him in almost a @DATE1 because he has created a new family on the computer and spends the whole day pretending he is a @CAPS10 an fighting dragons on the internet game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that @PERCENT3 of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor @PERSON2 had this to say about how this is affecting @CAPS5. "Too many @CAPS5 are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. They stop caring about school, sports, even their friends. It's alarming!" @CAPS12 reason could you have to use a computer after learning how bad it is for you and your @CAPS5! Computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity. They are extremely dangerous for our health. They cause us to stop exercising and gain weight, permanently damage our eyes, and deny us of the proper socialization that all people need to be happy and health. Is this @CAPS12 you want for your self and generations to come?"

Computers, are very popular these days. Many people use computers for research, jobs, shopping, homework, and more. Although, some people think computers take up too much of our time and that it prevents society from interacting with friends and family. What's great about computers is that, you can chat with your friends and family online or even have a video chat with them. So, you're never really avoiding your friends and family. Another thing that is great about computers is, you can research anything you need to, for projects, jobs, homework, and things for school, etc. The top websites people use for resources are, @CAPS1.com @LOCATION1. etc. Computers are also great for typing out reports , making powerpoints for jobs and projects, and so much more! Anything you could think of is most likely found in a computer. As, you can see a computer is so helpful and is a great resource. having a computer at home is much better than taking a trip down to the public library save time and money from taking all those trips and get your own personal library ny getting a computer. you never know what new technology could bring.

Everyone will agree that using computers is also a good choice because you do meet people you don't know. Also you learn more stuff you don't know. Not only that but, u can also learn more about technology. Most people would say that, meeting people is good because you can have fun talking and getting to know people. Also, people would want to learn about other people cultures. Some people would want to know some personal, buiseness about peopl. Even people want to know where are some people from. People like to kno

Dear @CAPS1's at the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 to @PERSON2, "Computers have helped me further @CAPS6 research. I can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all @CAPS6 important information organized." @CAPS3 you question a leading doctor? I agree with @PERSON3 and say that computers are good use in society today. People were already becoming lazy because of television. You can't balme it on computers. With websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, people can keep in touch. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. "@CAPS6 patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me now if they think something's very wrong with them." say's @PERSON1. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill. you can just @CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How @CAPS3 feel if no one called and told you your bestfriend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You'd be extremely upset. I know I @CAPS3 be with email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn't know hoe to tell you, they could email you. It's so much easier than telling a person that their.mom died by email them by phone. To hear pain in a person's voice will make you want to cry. You feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today's society? You can't blame computer's for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person want's to be lazy, then that's their decision. you shouln't go around blaming pothers and things when its no one else's fault but that persons. This is a great way to keep in contact with other's. Plus, think of all the information you can learn. Not just about family and friends, but the world too. Thank you for taking the time to read @CAPS6 essay and I hope you can see things @CAPS6 way.

One evening, @CAPS1 I got home from school, I didn't know what I had for homework. I decided to call my friends cell phone, but instead I got her voicemail. I left her a voicemail and called her house phone instead, the same thing bad happened. Luckily, I had my other friends numbers I could use. The next day, I asked her why she didn't pick her cell and house phone. She told me "I'm sorry, I guess I was to busy on the computer e-mailing other people." @CAPS1 I think of people being on the computer too much, I think they don't get enought exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. First @CAPS1 people spend too much time on the computer, they spend less time excersising. About @PERCENT1 of people do this and it's not healthy. @CAPS2 people do this too often, then they will not get enough excercise and without excersise then they won't be healthy @CAPS1 they get older. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said "@CAPS2 adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @NUM1 hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @CAPS2 adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's to early for kids to be unhealthy." I also agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1, she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don't care about nature, @CAPS1 people do this, I can't stand it. Its like they don't care about anything else. What I don't get is why can't they go outside and do something for at least a half hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. You could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand @CAPS2 its a bad day like @CAPS2 its snowing or a thunderstorm and you can't do anything outside, then you go on the computer. I think that at least @PERCENT2 of people would try this. Third, @CAPS2 people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hung out with friends or family. @CAPS2 your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. But you can't because your on the computer, she would be furious at you. You picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There's probably a @PERCENT1 chance she won't ever talk to ou again. and I don't blame her. People who spend to much time on the computer, would barely understand whats going on. @CAPS2 someone tells you something, it goes in one ear and out the other. @CAPS1 people do this, its really dissappointing because you dont hang out as much as with your friends and family. As you can see, people are spending too much time on the computer than excersing, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. @CAPS2 you ask me, I don't play on the computer as much which is a good thing.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society. Well I would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way. The computer is like a addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. I dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Every were you look theres a computer. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life?

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers have increased. You don't see kids outside as often. On the news, you hear about obesity. And you hear the crime rates go up. This does not benefit the socierty. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says "he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood." And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone's name and be underover. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick-minded people get to you or your kids. Take action now!

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2: The effects computers have on people are bad because they are getting too addicted, the computers is a dangerous site to go on, and their brain is smarter then the @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, they are getting too addicting because computers @MONTH1 have a benefit of you being able to serf the internet but you'll get hooked on it too much. For example, youtube is an internet siting that about @NUM1 people go on and barely get off. The people don't turn off their computers to just go get some exercise but just sit there staring at the @CAPS5 and messing up their eyesite. These people need to learn have the will power to get off the @CAPS5. Second, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on because some people in the @LOCATION1 give somebody their @CAPS3 on the @CAPS5 to somebody they don't know about. Almost @PERCENT2 of teens get kidnapped because od giving their @CAPS3 a way to stranger and @PERCENT3 of those teens don't get found. The @CAPS5 is also a place of where a child or teen @MONTH1 get cyber bullied. Cyberbullying is harrassing children or teens on the internet, when children under or over @NUM2 get cyberbullied they sometimes suffer through a deppression and don't tell their parents about it. Six months ago at my old @CAPS4, there was a volunteer at my @CAPS4 talking about cyberbullying and how he got so depressed because of the harrassment, that he commited suicide. The @CAPS5 is not always a safe place to be on. Finally, your brain more smarter than the @CAPS5.People can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on the their computers because your brains are like computers. About @PERCENT1 of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life. The brain is like a @CAPS5 because you can store information and nobody can hack into it. So therefore, computers have bad effects on people because they are getting to addicting, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on, and your brain is smarter than tha @CAPS5.

Dear society, @CAPS1't you all have some kind of computer at home? Work? What if we took you computer away? How would you work? These are all esential questions. The computers of our time help us with what we do everyday. First of all they teach hand-eye coordination. Secondly they give us the ability to learn and communicate with the far away places. Lastly, They allow people to communicate quickly by an email or an @CAPS2. If those experts took our computers, @CAPS6 about what would happen. @PERCENT1 of americans have a computer or a cellphone with internet. These people have hane-eye coordination, therefore they use technology alot. People who use computers at work can multi-task. Secondly the modern computer lis a huge necessity. Thirdly, The people who are still in school have to write papers, do reports, but with-out computers. How will they accomplish that? @CAPS6 about what society would be like. Picture it. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4. These are all websites that have chats where people can communicate. Take it away. See what happens. We only have the telephone what if we @CAPS1't know some ones cellphone number? can't go on a computer that isn't there. Take all of that into consideration. Maybe the computer prevents us from face-to-face communication, but it's a common necessity. We need to be able to ask someone a quick question. Cellphones and calling aren't as quick as on @CAPS2. Do you really want to be the one to take it away? @CAPS6, @CAPS6 about what your to do. Take this letter into consideration. what are you to do? These computers, help with everyday life. From school to work to just fun. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about people and far away places. thirdly they allow people to communicate, so go ahead, take it away, but see what happens when you do.

I think that will are all spending to much time in computers because all of my frend are all day in @CAPS2 I think that people should get active and go to different places in the wold like the pool the forect the lackes ets. I think that they shood pot a program that people come go places and forget about computer for me computer are good but you cannot spend a lot of time in @CAPS2 like try to spend more time out doors and whith you family or frends. And the problem is not only with computers is with a lot of technology like video games like xbos - @NUM1 - @NUM2 - game boy - xbox @NUM3 and other more more you schood play them @NUM4 a week like @NUM5 hour because ther alot of activitis you and your family can do out doors I will thake a wake aroud the park or ride bickes with you freds aroud town and make a picknick on the park @CAPS1 is hot and good outside.

Dear, @CAPS1 town. As you know it computers are a part of our lives, but is it positive or negitive? Computers can be a great thing it can show you different parts of the world and breaking news, it can deside your next vacation. It could help you talk to famile and friend. What would are lives be without them? Well are lives without computers can be bad. Computers do have negitive sides to like spending lots of maney for one all the times. It needs to be fixed. People can use the computer to much and they want exercise. That can lead to fatness. Also you can waist lots of energy to. A bad part about the internet is chat rooms, if you talk to the wrong people then you can be in trouble. Overall computers are a key part of our and they can help deside with our next @DATE1 breack trip and they can use by making us fat.

Many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them. But are they are bad for individuals to use as people say they are. In this instance, a moderation would be helpful. When you think of computers, what comes to mind. Games? Social @CAPS1? What if computers are doing more than that? Last year, a computer helped diagnose a concussion of mine and helped figure out I've had @NUM1 others. Not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human. An expert says "Computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, @PERCENT1 better than doctors." @CAPS2 the social netwowrking has a positive aspect. This has let people, who haven't seen each other for a long time, reconnect and become good friends again. With the positive aspects there is always a negative. Computer have started to make kids obese. This is problem in the country because if we become lazy then we could ruin our country. In addition, if we become has reliant of computers @NUM2 diagnos, what happens when they get faulty? These are problems that are very real and aren't being with. If we cant deal with these problems first then computers will turn out to be a bad thing. Lastly, a moderation could be extremely helpful for us today. For example, instead of using social @CAPS1 for friends next door, go outside and play wiffle ball with them. Social @CAPS1 was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street. @CAPS2, instead of totally reling on computers to diagnose problems, have them and the doctor find out. Doing this will get great results and keep doctors prepared if computers, dont work. These are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone. In conclusion, having no computers wouldn't be a great idea because of how much they help society. Although, being totally dependent on them is a bad idea to because they don't have that much benefit to them.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1... scroll... @CAPS1. "@CAPS2 you know that only the male coqui is the only coqui that sings?" Some facts are easily found on the interneat? The computers make researching easier just imagine not having to drag home those gigantic books home or having to constantly find information in them. First, the computer teach as hand-eye coordination. Second, we can learn about faraway places. Finally, we can make friends from all over the world. When, the ball goes right out of the parts! the plastic object with a screen(computers) teach us hand-eye coordination. It teachs us this by making our eyes stay on the screen, twhile our hand are on the hard, smooth keyboard. Children need hand-eye coordination for ball-playing sports like baseball, basketball, soccer and more. When your in high school and play sports well, you @MONTH1 get scholar-ships to go to college. College is important because it has a big role in our life so we @MONTH1 earn great jobs. Learning about faraway place like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 and so on is very intersting. Unless, your learning about it throught looks, which are dull and borring. The interneat has taken over our and it is resentlessly and without hesitation. The internet takes less time than going to the libary and getting back. Also, skimming throught paragraph after paragraph on the computer is much simple.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extreamly bad for you, and we need to take percaution, and worry about eye protection vertual harrasment, and that there are dangerouse people on the @CAPS2. Eye protection is important. Although computers are hurting them by, the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes. Also if you look for too long it could make them tierd. I can tell you from personal experence that glasses are un-cool and some people get picked on for it and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you can see as well as you did befor. It's glasses or even going blind. Vertual harrasment is another thing to be aware of. Over the @CAPS2 you could be cyber bullyed by kids you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not know. For example, one day you could be on @CAPS3 and be talking on a chat room and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or even just plain remakes. Witch brings me to the, sexual harrasment. Sexual harrasment if extreamly can make people feel usually bad selfs. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding there rase, there gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra percaution when seeing sexual harrasment. Sexual preditors are a parents biggest fear to kids. Sexual preditors are everyware, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS3, or even your neibors and wile kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do there extreamly un-safe. This is why you @CAPS7 put any personal information on the @CAPS2 not your adress, not your birthday, not your cell or house numbers, nothing not even your town. Also sometimes its a little dangerous to put your last name. So be very carful on the intrenet. When you see sexual harrasment, or someone being followed by a sexual preditor report them! and be safe.

Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that computers do not benefit society. I believe this beacause when the computer you spend less time exercising. Secondly computers make time enjoying nature. Finally interacting with family and friends is important when on the computer you don't do much of that. Plese read on to find out what i have to say about computers. Using a computer has a of down falls but @CAPS1 of which is the lack of exerizing while on the computer. As you @MONTH1 know that many countrys are becoming obese because the lack of exersize. Computers are no help to this problem. The only exersize computer contribute is the hand and fingers but even that is bad because if you are typing and on computer for too long you will get carpeltunlye in the fingers and hands. @PERSON1, an expert on health, said "@CAPS1 in three people go on the computer for more than @CAPS1 hour a day, which could lead to obesinty. This leads to my next paragraph. When on the computer there is no enjoying the outdoors. Enjoying nature is important to every man or women's scegule. On a computer its imposible to enjoy nature because all the computer is is a time consuming brain washing thing to do. Nature helps save the brain. Without that then you'll be very exausted all the time. Did you know @PERCENT1 of kids go outside every day that means @PERCENT2 of kids are in side on the computer. This leads to my finally topic. The computer @MONTH1 have sites where you can talk to friends but that is no where as good as seeing them in person. Your family is important so you need to spend time with them. My family always does stuff together like board games and what not. With computers there would not be any time with your family because everybody will be on the computer playing games insted of spending time with you family. In my conlusion computer have extraordinary bad affect on society because it exausts time for exersicing, also limits time to enjoy nature and finally people spent too time on computers and too little time interacting with family and friends, thank you for reading my paragraph on the many affects of computers

Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3…. My name is @PERSON1 and I am concernd about people around the world are use computer is to much during the day. Some compute's are bad because there are glitche's in the computer and every one has a myspace and myspaces has a viries and it leaves a vires in your computer and your computer shut's down or goes slow. Also people can hack your computer and you cant find out about and every thing that was on your computer can go around the world. People can kno your most secread's and more. Finly you can get caught macking movies on your computer and go to jail and your business will be out.

Dear @CAPS1, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people, think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. Tere is video-chatting, e-mail and chat websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer if you are web-chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as @CAPS2, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to @STATE1 and had to leave all my friends behind, the computers has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn't want to. I can e-mail my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on @CAPS2. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to @LOCATION1, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said. "Computers just make @CAPS6 all of the information I need to knew about your brother's diabetes so easy." @CAPS6 information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made @CAPS6 information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won't take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people stayin touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that needed, and they make our school lives aint easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!

Dear Local newspaper, I have concerned because lately a lot of people have been using computers alot. My concern is that they haven't been exercising much, they arent enjoy nature and they aren't spending much time with their family. This is not a posiitve way for their life. In my opinion excercising is a very, very, very important thing to do. This is because you need to mantain a healthy diet to stay healthy and you need to excersise. Some people I know don't exercise and they are either overweight or not healthy. People are "busy", as they say, uisng the computer to do all there work because they just don't like using the old fashion way, which is going to your job and doing your work. Everything is different now and people have become lazyier than ever before. Would people be lazy, if computers weren't around? Of course they wouldn't be. They would have a happy healthy life. Now-a-days, people don't go out and explore the world much they just go online and nthey search a place up on a google. They don't see the real thing though. they see pictures and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way, way better than looking at a picture. But i guess everyone forgot about that. Computers have everything online, no wonder poeple don't want to leave their homes and if they do leave, don"t worry they have a laptop with them. Computers are even portable go wherever they go their still going to go online. Poeple have also spent less time with family because they could talk to them online in a s chat room. This isn't a good thing because what if you were talking to your "mother", well at least you think is your mother but is someone else and your talking about your, I didn't know, something private and that person on the other computer, "your mother", will know about that and can cause problems with you. You know waht I mean? Like if you were talking about your credit card and that person asked you for your credit card number and you gave it to them then they could cause problems. Online isn;t a safe place, thats why you should talk in person not on a chat room. Well I hope that you put my letter in the newspaper for people could exercise, see the nature and be with family, like they were when they didn't have computers around.

Dear, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people use the internet. Too @CAPS2 which leads to lack or exercise. Others play games online. Some people fear oline chat rooms online. They'nt safe some people get really injured or murdured. Exercise is important @CAPS2 people let that bobby. That is very dangerous because your cholesterol will rise. You will gain wait and that can, lower your self-asteem. Other people comitt suicide because the way they appear and no one wants that. That is sad for everyone plus it's not worth it. Video games oline are very amusing. But people would kill for these games. games are a let alone online . Online chat rooms are very dangerous you never know who your writing to. Millions of people died for saying the wrong stuff. Other been raped or melested by these strangers. Thousands of kid's give out there address and have been robbed. There are wierd, crazy or suicide people in the world. So don't make yourself a traget. I personally I don't agree with computer use of all. So @CAPS2 thing can happen if you do the wrong stuff. So I hope you understand and agree with my reasons.
<START>

My opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out. If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she sould go out side and get some fresh air and get some exrcise. Some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurder/kill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralized from lack of exercise or get lumf ophemia thats when your body a pears and will not be a to exercise and would need special treatments. Like masogise. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand eye coordination by useing the still looking sometimes some people for useing the computer: videos, video, and websites. You can get your computer uloaded for for quality. Some systems howe computers in them or can be connected to the computer like the, and the @CAPS1 @NUM1 @CAPS2. There are games called p.c. games some p.c. games comeucicate with childern to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also spiecal computers and/or web-sites you can search for tutorial for speaking different langueges. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instroments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptynis inside of them inistead of eating. Some people obeuse the compeuter as a dug like they're addictied to it. Imagine someone addictied to computers every where he/she goes they would take their laptop with them. Many people have died useing the computer but thats because they obeused it. Everyday people buy computers this invention is very helpful as time goes on sciantists are makeing new things to save llives.

Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 your workers wake up in the @TIME1, they stretch their right muscles and put on their puzzy slippers. They wonder down the hailway and open their @CAPS2 book air to check the weather for today. They go on @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, and etc. to view their e-mails sent from work friends, and family. They check the time on the bootom of the laptop screen and lag onto to play some they are getting ready. Society today relies heavily on computers and the net work their keeps us all connected... the incorect with technological advances happening today, people are now using computers to help with their work. But is that a some @MONTH1 say that it is due to the fact the amount of spent on the computer is the much and that it stop from with friends but it does computers help with the skill of typing, help with fast end easy and helps friends and @NUM2. of through @NUM2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc I believe that computers have a possitive affect on people and once a great addition to society. to begin, computers help to reach @CAPS6, children, and even adults the skill of typing. Statistics show that more and more jobs on computers and hire people with a higher words per minute ability with almost @PERCENT1 of adopting new computer and using computers to store information to their company, computers are necesity and so is the knowledge of understanding computers and being able to type. Moreover, @CAPS6 these days are depending on computers for research to order to do projects and information I can personally connect to this because being a student on @LOCATION1 school, I am assigned project what involve typed words and or information. how hand it would I had to hand writs all of my work and on the for information. @CAPS1 multiple @CAPS6 are assigned the same project, the does not millon @CAPS6 to check looks out @CAPS5 there was no computer to use, what would I do? for @CAPS6, computers and a great thing. Furthermore, @CAPS6 and even adults enjoy social time, but @CAPS1 friends are family line faraway or you are not able to visit three, the computer connect in handy computer help to keep friends and family connected through @CAPS3, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 / or @NUM1, I.M / @PERSON1, and webcam video chats. All of those computer related things would not there for @CAPS5 there were no computer. Would you want no be disconected from family and being social is a key part of being You why shouldnt we keep them and why with all of these possitive things about computer would ever make you doubt them? In computers are wonderful things. They he is to build skill of typing, help and it easy, and also help keep and family connected. Computers affect people only good ways and help everday life be easy. so, believe that computers are a great thing and that without them, even just talking to family could be jeaporadized. Lets keep computers

Dear The @CAPS1, People have been saying that computers are not beneficial, but they are wrong. In my opinion computers are very beneficial. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places, also, you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand-eye coordinaiton? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type. Without having to lock down at the keyboard. Even if people don't have the program they can learn how to type fact without having to look down. Many people that I know, have learned how to use the computer or type without anyone telling them hour to do so. Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. If you go on the internet you can go and searching person or place and the computer will find it for you. Children and adults need computers because if for example, a child get a project from schoool that need to be done about a famous person or smoking. she would most likely need to go to the internet . The game goes for adults that love jobs in offices, schools or anywhere else. Computers are essential to people all around the world. Computer can be used to comunicate with each other. People use computer to communicate with friends or family in far away places. They can communicate via e-mail, @CAPS2, video and maybe even in other web sites. Some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. Why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer? Computers can be used to learn hand-eye coordination, and help you move your fingers faster. They give poeple and places in the world. Finally, they can be used to communicate with one another through e-mail, message and many other ways. In my opinion, computers are one of the most important things to a person.

Dear Newspaper, Have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight? Well its true. People say that it is because of eat a lot of fast food but I think that since we are always on the computer and not excersing helps contribute to it. Also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. Sitting infront of the computer isn't going to help our environment. Lastly, kids aren't getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. @CAPS1 not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way limit it. To start on with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. Some @MONTH1 say that people chose not to excerise but if we limit things then they won't have to chose. As a kid myself, I love to be on the computer. My parents are always trying to get the computer and take the dogs for a walk and I always say "@CAPS1 busy" @CAPS2 its true, I don't really like to go outside because I have a computer to play games or talk to friends and to be honest excersing to me seems important but I don't do it because I'm always on the computer. I think that other people could feel this way so thats why we need to limit the computer. Secondly, global warming is occuring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer then go outside and enjoy the nature. @CAPS2, you @MONTH1 be able to look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? Some @MONTH1 not because they could just stay on the computer and keep "@CAPS3 up" ways to help another things is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming so it we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. Lastly, internet sites like myspace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. When we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they can't. Also interacting with your family and friend @MONTH1 let you go in new places that you haven't been before and on the computer you can't go there. Interacting with friends & family is better than talk thru the computer. In conclusion if we stay on the computer then we won't get excerise enjoy nature or interact with friends. So we need to act now limit compute usage!
<START>

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise. Don't get to enjoy the nature around them, and they don't get to interact with their family and friends! If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer, then they wouldn't be having too many issues. People need to spend less time on computers, and spending more time exercising! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands. You don't tend to want to get up or do anything else when you're on your computer, right? Well that needs to change. Often, peolple get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one. Some people are so obsessed, they might even break down and have a fit! Nobody want's to see someone throw a fit because they have to get off the computer do they? If they don't get exercise anytime when you're not on a computer it can deffinately shows. Jimmy @CAPS2 syas, "@CAPS3 @NUM1 kids are on their computers way to much! They never come out of their rooms, and if they ever do, then they are normally very cranky. They're getting fat! I can tell because all they eat is junk food. This needs to " @CAPS4 can't even have a little of time with his children. They should go on a family trip and enjoy together! That brings us in next issue. We all need to enjoy nature more. Why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your . It's because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy and go outisde. The best thing about nature is that if you are  about need to be alone or even just need to get , nature is always there for you anytime you need it. You can laways go otside with your friends and family too!. I'm sure that they would apreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together. Yet again, our next and final issue. Computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends. When talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun? ALso, when you spend time with your family, it brings them a lot closer toy ou. Nobody likes to not talk to the people you love and the people who reised you. When you're on a computer I just think of all the places you could , place you could be with. Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family. Therefore, people should turn off their computers, go exercise, be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family. Thank you

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know, @CAPS2 people are starting to buy and own computers. Some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors. I disagree with this statement. First, computers help us with every day life. We check news on computers, some people even use their computers @CAPS1 a @CAPS3 and watch important shows. Second, a computer is a great way to comunicate. @CAPS10 its friends, family or even buisness, a computer is a excelent way of communication. finally, a computer is help when it comes to school or work. You could write a paper on the computer for example read on to see how I support my reasons of why computers are helpful in peoples lives. Have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about? Well, @CAPS10 you had a computer, you could go online to the news website and read more. This is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life, there are plenty more. Another way is @CAPS10 you don't own a @CAPS3, you could watch your favorite show on the computer. My english teacher @PERSON1 says "I never owned a @CAPS3, I only watch @CAPS3 on my computer and I like it better" In fact @PERCENT1 of people who watch videos on the computer like it better than @CAPS3. This is how computers come in handy in every day life. I love how computers have @CAPS2 ways of comunicating. I like it because I have @CAPS2 relatives who live far away and I use my computer to comunicate with them from time to time. Skype is my favorite, I can see the person @CAPS8 talking to at the same time. Also computers can be good for business for large companies who need to comunicate out of the contry. I'm sure being a amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy comunication. finally, comunication with friends. These are @CAPS2 programs for this, @CAPS9 @CAPS1 facebook and myspace. This is why a computer is a good way of comunication. finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. It's much faster than writing. Also, @CAPS10 you need more info on something, you could look it up online. like @CAPS10 you are writing an article on dolphins, you could learn more about them. In conclusion I think computers are good things. They help with everyday life, They are good for comunication. And last they help at school or work.

Wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life. I would, we need computer for many things, for example we need computer for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. Next this is good for buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @MONTH1 have missed as if you was absent. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @MONTH1 be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Now a days many college students with work going on @MONTH1 not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. With computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @CAPS1 from the I have told you like communications, education, and buying and selling products I hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society

Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you love haveing the enternet at your finger tips. Recently, it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I firmly believe that this is correct. My three arguments are its not healthy, the friends you meet up there are siber friends and bad @CAPS5 @MONTH1 occur. First of all, being on the computer too much is not healthy. This reminds me of my friend named @CAPS2. @CAPS2 used to be humerous, outgoing and play alot of sports. One @CAPS3 day, her mother bought her a laptop. This laptop was blue and white-her two faverite colors. She was on it all day and all night. She took it with her everywhere she went. Well, it got to the point whare she stopped the sports, gained some weight and the sadness creptped upon her. She was in a depresion mode. She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only. She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @CAPS2 she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. Second of all, the friends you meet on the enternet are called cyber friends. You don't know who they realy are, where they realy live, or their real age. They can tell you any thing they want because they know that that's a little fantasy world. That is mently not healthy. It is very important for human beings to be socialy active. Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also. Third of all, @CAPS5 @MONTH1 pop up. If you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get like becky, it is not good for you or the device. Being on the computer can harm even the computer. Well, you've read my arguments and ideas. Please take them into consideration.

Computers, Computers, Computers! That’s the first thing a teenager does right when they get home from school. Teenagers just can't wait to chat with their friends on facebook and instant message. There are a lot of positive and negative things about computers. In these paragraphs below I am going to give you my opinion, tell you how people can manage there time better and the effects it can have. My @CAPS1 experience with computers is that they have @CAPS3 much information but sometimes it can be too much. Today, a lot of children and teenagers are getting bullied. People can send horrible messages to someone. They rather do it on the computer because they don't have to say it to there faces. that is one thing that I don't live about computers is that people can get harrased. Other then that I think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past. Not a lot of @CAPS2 want to see there child coming straight home from school and go right to the computer @CAPS2 have to be strict with there child when it comes to computers. They need to manage there time @CAPS3 they can alson do there homework, after school activities etc.... Studies have shown that children who go on the computer every single day for more than two hours are most timely to see their grades drop. That's why if you mange your time it wouldn't be a problem. You want your child to have a balance in there life, @CAPS3 manage the time where they are not all day long. There are positive things about the computer and as well as negative things. The computer is a great way to research people you are learning about in school and find people from your past for example, facebook is a great way to stay connected to your old buddies. Google is also a great tool because you can type in anything and it wil give you a hundred websites to chose from a negative effect about it is that people are likely to say things on it to other people that they wouldn't dare to beg to there face. It also prevents you from doing other things because you get @CAPS3 consumed about the computer you forget your main priorietees. In these paragraphs I gave you my opion on computers and how there are posotive and negative things about them. I also explainted how it can taking up your time with your main priorities in life and how to manage your time wisely. The computer is a great tool but don't get take to much advantage of it because it is not a priority.

Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on peoples' lives. You can do alot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convinient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see @LOCATION1, you can go online to learn @CAPS1 language. You can also study food s that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can daunloads and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure that let you explore new lands. And in alot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are otherways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, facebook, twitter, and video chat. With any of these things you can talks to friends or family around the world or in your state/country. All of these you can either download, go on the internet for, or buy them. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you havent seen in a while. Video chat you can see eacho ther, face book you can share pictures and chat rooms you can talk with multiple people. In conclusion computers are very convinient for our society today. Whether it's studying the world, having fun, or talking to people you know, the computer has many wonderous things for people

What is technology? Technology is defined as anything that helps enhance our way of living. Technology is all around us. Our beds, houses, televisions and even chairs are all forms of technology. There is one form of technology however, in my opinion, has revolutionized modern day living as we know it. This form of technology is called the computer. My outlook on the effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive. Just think of all of the things we rely on this device to do. There is one thing, however that really sticks out in my mind; @CAPS1. The computer is perhaps the greatest form of @CAPS1 the world has ever seen. E-mail is basically sending a letter to a friend without the hassle of mailing it out where it might get lost or stolen. E-mailing is two simple steps: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Not only does it lower the risk of the letter not getting there, but it is also much quicker. You hit the "sen" button and before you know it, a new letter is sitting in you friends inbox. Another method of computerized @CAPS1 is my personal favorite, instant messaging. Instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away. And it's okay if you decide to go get a soda while you are instant messaing because unlike a real conversation, that isn't rude. These are just two methods of @CAPS1 that the computer enables us to have. Tehre is a variety of other that, much like these two, enhance our way of life. I believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing: the internet. The internet makes everything we do on the computer possible. If i want to gon on the computer and do research on a topic, the internet takes me where i want to go. With millions of different websites, the internet has endless possibilities. If I'm interested in arcade games, I can go on the internet and play them. If i have to write a science report, then i can go on the internet and collect research. If i want to listen to music, tehn i can go on the computer, look up a song, and listen to it. And guess what? If i'm looking for a funny video just for a good laugh, then the internet can find me one! The internet is perhaps one of the greatest things ever invented. It's just another reason to love the computer.
<START>

The computer is able to do so many things. It think computers have posotive effects on people. But some experts believe they don’t which is why I'm writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. Computers believe it they help us in life wether @CAPS1 to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @DATE1, @CAPS1 one of the most important devices. Let me share my expierence okay. I had a job interview right well I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview. Thats why I think computers have posotive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. Well I have some people spend to much time on their computer @CAPS1 completely choice. And those are people who usually don't have alot of self control. And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. So in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I as a computer user, think computers are helpfull in many ways. They help get new @CAPS3. They help function machines. They help people learn new things. Computers help find and get new @CAPS3. They provide the public in another way to find a new or another job. My brother; for example, @CAPS4 went to a university there @CAPS4 learned how to become a micanic. @CAPS4 was having a hard time finding a job, (looking for me on the street) so somone told him to go on @CAPS1.com and go to "@CAPS2 @CAPS3" @CAPS4 did and there on the computer @CAPS4 found a good job and still works there. The computer or great way to find a job. Computers help function machines. All the machines that we have to use and had to run by hand now run by computers. That is good in someway and bad on another way. They help make more product in less time. Today more cars are being made in less time if you've seen sometimes in of cars you saw the assemble line with michanical robot hands putting them together and that is using computers. One major problem to this is many people are lossing their @CAPS3. The computer teacher people
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle schoolers growing up, I believe using computers can be beneficial at same point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of innapproprate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to "hack" or tresspass someone else's computer. Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download innapropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use. criminal acts, vulgar language and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that "@CAPS4 @CAPS5" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, apperance, and age. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much "fun" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @NUM1 hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be innappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. More and more peole become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my oppinnion.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I support the advances in technology, and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I think this for @NUM1 simple reasons, @CAPS1, you gain computer skills, which can help in other situations. Second: Computers give people the chance to learn about faraway people and places.Lastly when you have a computer you can chat and talk to other people. When I think of a computer, I think of typing or a keyboard. After a few times of using a computer you get @CAPS2 and better it. You gain, typing skills, hand eye coordination and mouse skills. After jusst a few uses, your computer skills build up and you soon get good at it. When you do get @CAPS2 though, you get better quicker and more so it all works out very well. When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search anything and everything. Weather it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is helpful. When I am doing my homework, and I don't know how to another a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get help with any homework I need help in, its great.I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but theres no one to talk to? Well that problem can be solved very simply, get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone half way around the world. Its amazing you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. A computers chat you to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. Computers are great. When your on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it. They are helpful and fun you never run out of options with a computer at your side. In my opinion, there is so much to gain and learn from a computer.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. But why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer. I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. Sure enough he was! I got the home work and got an A all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a good effect on people and not a bad effect. I think this for three reasons. My first reason is that they relieve stress. Without a computer in my opinion things would be a lot more stressful. With a computer you can easily look things up without wasting time or being stressed out by having to look for something. My second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is technology. Without technology things would be so much harder. Without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments, print out pictures, and getting information. If we didn't have technology as in computers I think a lot or things would go wrong. My third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them factories would crash. i say this because if you think about it could in a factory is ran by some type of computer. Without that computer telling the machines what to do everything practically wouldn't work! without the computer everything would become so time consuming that no one would want to get the work done. These are my three reasons why I think computers have a good effect on people.
<START>

Dear whom it @CAPS1, Have you ever wondered what it be like to spend all your time in front of computers? Well, if you are, I believe that should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom says only an hour aa day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and (or) play over a friends house. Yes, playing on computer is fun, but you have to execise to. (you know) @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors. Like that's how I met trees, animals, beautiful senery. You could feel like you were having the time or your. The last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use. you could make snowmen in the winter or if it's raining you could watch a movie. you could build a lot. In conclusion building, playing and jumping (the list could go on) You can enjoy the outdoors. Just rember the three good reason why are you could use the wonderful and lovly outdoors. Go walk you dog, have friends ober or even just having out with your family and friends.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers: well computers are a big thing now a days, you can look up information, learn new things, and it, keep you busy. It brings a whole package. Learning and getting information like facts, past, the @CAPS1 it helps us understand what we are living around and know how things came together a computer is like a trip to the library, all the information is pretty much the samo. You can look things uo for a project or too much. And what's is best of all i can all you on a flash in folders if computer is .You learn some things now everyday and comes in people both it up on @MONTH1 be a different website all can @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2 an @CAPS4 and etc some people cant live without these thing either but some times these objects on a computer like any music player you have to download misuc etc apps and at the same time havinf these things it keeps you busy and moving Computers are a big thing as you can see they put an impact in someone. Looking up info, learn now it's entertainment, are some or laptop they bring

Everyone loves staying on the computer. I would be surprised if one does not. I believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that is also as enjoyable on it is. People learn too much on it. It changes peoples whole life. The computer is like a disease or a virus that controles you and gaining your freedom from it perfectly possible. I understand that some people @MONTH1 not agree with me, however I propose that my side is the best. This is horrible. How can it? It distracts people from their life. I makes them blind to enjoy nature. Spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease. The hard part is to get in your freedom is being able to know that it is ocntroling you. That way your door to freedom will be open. The tecknologie keeps you away from having fun, doing homework from school and having fun with friends. I know that you can break free from it because I once experienced the same thing. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed. I has so many information in it you wont even think a person it. I know even more than . However it is also very foul. Once I came up on a very horrible seen on the computer. I my i can shut it . Michines have a mind that it our and anything it. Changing a persons life is not easy. You become complitely new. Sometimes those changes are good sometimes they are bad. But a michine can make you change in ten minutes. Once you see what you like on it or what you want you can change. If you see something and you want it so bad. I you cant get if then you will be forced to get it by stealing. It is a very horrible thing to learn. All you have to do is learn to controle your self. Machines are a very bad influence on people. There are book if you need information. Computers make you lazy you don't have to read or anything it does it for you. It take over your life. You become . It teaches you bad thing it changes your life. What path would you take
<START>

Wouldn't you agree that computers have a great affect on people. The three reason why they have a good affect on people is because, it gives you good typing skills, its educational, and it helps you out with alot of things. The first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills. If you have a computer you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good. Each time you use the computer your hands ajust to the keys on the computer. Say if there is someone that wants to work with computers when they get older, well if they practice their typing on their computers at home they will be eligible for the job working with computers. Also computers could be good for the hearing impared. If the hearing impared use to the computers then they can get a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 and chat with people online. This would be useful to them because since they could not hear what people say they can read what people say through the internet. Another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational. In my opinion, computers are very educational because there are alot of websites that teach you facts about different places. For example, what food people eat in different countrys, or where that country is. A website that is the best for finding out accurate facts is www.Ask.com. Ask.com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds. Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites. The last reason why computers have a affect on people is because they help you with alot of things. They help you with alot of things because if you want to know how far @LOCATION2 is from @LOCATION1 then you can go on your pc and find out, or say that you lost the directions to your friends house and your on your way to their house if you brought your labtop you can go on the labtap and find where her house is from your labtop. I know your probably thinking there is such thing as a gps, well if you think about it gps's can be confusing, but your computer reads it out to you. Know your probably saying in your heads why don't you text/call @CAPS3/@CAPS4 if you think about it what if your friend does not talk clearly. In conclusion, wouldn't you agree that computers do have good effects on people. My three arguments are, they help your typing skill educational. They help you with things. please take my ideas into consideration.

My experience with commputer's is good because I can play games or do my homework. I can install my own music on my commputer and do my homework at the same time. I can also go on the internet with commputer's. On commputer's I can also do things quicker and easyer. I can also get more things done faster by getting the internet and going on it because I can do reaserch and copie and past stuff off the internet. I now have a labtop and it is preaty much portble commputer. On my labtop and it is preaty much poratble commputer. On my labtop I can make data tables and graph's and write papers and use dial up connection. Dial up connection is what I can use to get free internet by putting a presons phone number in the place were the phone number goes the labtop will call up the motem if the phone line is connected to the motem. On my labtop I also have a place to put a floppy disc in and a place for a @CAPS1-@CAPS2 to go in to. I also have a calculator on my labtop. some labtop's also have a mouse that looks like a little pad like mine dose. As you can see commputer's and labtop's are realy good to own.

Dear The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 say that people are spending too much time foucusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are @CAPS1! Computers are a giant step into new technology. For example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online and give children some down time where they can learn about far away places and people. If you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly relized that you forgot one of the most important books! You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. Computers then come in handy. You can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson. Children @CAPS2 to commonicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends children would be knowhere. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, childeren can do reaserch, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about far away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now availble. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers @CAPS3 would not know the important news when @CAPS3 needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future (yes I am repertative) @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future. So all the people of @LOCATION1 keep your computers, they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology. Plus who would not want a good computer game once and a while.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think people should stop going on the computer? Well, yes because they are not getting exercise. People's body start to get lazy and don't want to get up. They are not spending time with the family instead they would like to spend their free time on the @CAPS3. This is my people should stop being lazy and have some fresh air. @CAPS2 you people who spend time on the computer interact with their family? Well, no, because they think they will get entertain by technology instead of their family. The reason I don't like compter so much because you get hook on so fast you can't stop. When you interact will family you get to know them better and that is priceless. This is why it should stop because it damage peoples minds. Another reasons I would like you to hear is less time exercising. When people don't exercise you will @CAPS2 anything to their body. They start to eat too much and later they become very lazy. When you exercise you have tons of energy to @CAPS2 anything. Like bunge jump. When you excerise you look healthy and people will notive. This why excerise is the best healthy and always fit. In addition, my third reason I would like you to read is enjoying nature. Enjoying nature you can have a good time and relax. You can swim in the beach, feel the amazing breeze, and have a good time. When you are on the computer you are sitting down instead going outside and that because a habit. It will be hurting are environment because people don't want to get up to enjoy nature. This is why it should not be tollerated because people are being lazy. In conclusion, the reason why people should not spend their life on computer because they think they will be entertain by technology instead of interacting will their family. People will start eating too much and so they will become lazy. People will never leave the house and instead they are on their computer. This is why it should stop it hurting are environment people are becoming lazy.

I agree that we shold have computers, because more and more people use computers. Long time ago we don't even have computers, but now we do. Now we have computers we should use it. If we don’t use computers why we even have computers? Computers can help you to learn faraway places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and other faraway places. If we don't know what is going on faraway places then we don't know what kind flag they have and what do they eat, what do they have, are what they do, and what do they speak. You can even talking online with your friends on computer! You dont have to call you friend, you can just talk to you frien on online, if you need help with your homework are you left your math text book at school you frient can tell you the questions by talking online. If your friend is in @LOCATION2 are other faraway places your friend can bring there computer with him or her so your friend can just talking to you by talking online, you dont have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other places. You can also learn how to type, when you know how to type you can type faster and faster. You can type storys, poem, and notes are something you have to do at school, so you don't have to write on a pace of peaper you can just type on computer. That is why we should have computers and use more. I hope you agree with me.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The question is close too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? In my opinion, no computers definitely don't make people lazy and less interactive with others aroud them. First, I think that computers can sometimes make you smarter. I mean you can read about history, world news and you can research many different topics. I remember when I was younger I would love to learn about the @CAPS1. I use to search it all the time and I made a poster project for fun. Thanks to the computer I got accurate information. A survey conducted by the @CAPS2 school social studies teacher shows that @PERCENT1 of their students used teh computers to find facts for school projects. @PERCENT2 out of that @PERCENT1 end up getting better grades. Famous psycologist @PERSON2 says that "kids and students learn more when they are on the computer researching or @CAPS7 new things." I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that too much internet is unhealthy for people but mostly syudents. But at @ORGANIZATION1 it a good source of @CAPS7 for them. Therefore the computer helps teach everyone facts and many stays on whats going on around the world. Second, people can interact with family and friends online. i mean there's @CAPS3 where people can socialize with their families who live out of state. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade I made a new friend and she moves to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I keep in touch with her on @CAPS3. A survey conducted by student council at that @PERCENT3 of students had someone they know and love move away out of state @PERCENT4 out of taht @PERCENT3 keep in touch by email or @CAPS3. Famous scientist @ORGANIZATION2 says, "People who keep in touch with family and friends tend to stay happy and not become depressed." I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that people don't need to keep in touch with their families all the time but it makes them happier. Therefore people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families. Third, you can learn new exercise, moves or tricks. I mean you can do new exercise, train for dance competition or learn new magic tricks for you magic show. I remember when I wanted to learn how to twirl a balon between my fingers I went and found a video of someone teaching step by step on how to do it. its easier now. A survey conducted by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 shows that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members get stronger and more fit by @CAPS7 new exercises. Famous athlete @PERSON1 says "@CAPS7 new exercises online helps me stay fit for my games". I know you @MONTH1 be thinking taht they can just go to someone to teach them BUT no one wants to pay money for something you can get free online. Therefore, @CAPS7 new exercises, moves or tricks online can help them out a lot. To conclude, does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? No, it helps them learn, socialize with family and friends and they can get in shape with the new exercise that they learn from how to videos.

People think that useing computers is a good thing, I think so to because there are alot of other people in this country that speak different languages and the computers can teach them insted of a person that just speaks our language. This for some people is their lives even alot of people use computers for their work. Kids also use the internet not for things such as, facebook, myspace, gmail, and alot of other web pages, I also use the internet but not as much anymore but I used to go on gaming pages like, @NUM1.com or even /cup/coffee but I dont go on those anymore that much because I have xbox live and that is a thing that the internet also comes in and you can talk to your friends. Some of my friends just fo on the computer and dont get any exercise at all but alot of my friends go on it but play alot of sports so there not just getting fat all the time. So people in the world basically have a computer but not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1, I think that our country should write a big pay check to those poor country and so they can get computers and so if they come here they can speak our language, or we ship that of computers to their countrys and so they dont buy any crappy computers. Also when your on a computer you can buy a webcam or it is already placed into your computer and you can talk to your friends or even show them that what you made or something like that. So I think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or who ever do.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I want to argue about the issue of computer use in @LOCATION1, @CAPS3, I'll tell you about the benefits of owning a computer. Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town are very good for society. There are the major benefits of using a computer. @CAPS3 is the fact you can use microsoft to write up a paper. Sixth grader @PERSON6 says, "I would rather type than write a paper. Another reason to use a computer is a for research." @CAPS4 many articles and facts are online about anything you need," says @PERSON4. The final benefit of a computer is the fact you can know about world news in a flash. "I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage," says @PERSON5. Those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer. Now lets talk about something. That is said to be bad but really isnt; social networking. Stuff like @CAPS5 use a texting form on a computer which helps us connect without making a huge phone bill: with instant messanger I can talk to @CAPS2 girlfriends," says @PERSON2. Also, there is facebook which can help us connect on a global stage. "I can talk with @CAPS2 cousin in @LOCATION2," says @CAPS6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. @CAPS3, we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. "I can use @CAPS2 computer anywhere I like," says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eigth grader @CAPS7 says, "I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick." The final major advance is the use of the printer," I use @CAPS2 printer to print of papers to bring to school," @PERSON3 said. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. There is many benefits to owning a computer. We talk to people world-wide when ever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology. @CAPS4 please help defend us kids in this case about computer use.

Losing @CAPS1 to @ORGANIZATION1 are a huge part of daily life these days, which is good for businesses, and schools but for people just looking to pass time, computers are a dangerous choice. Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment, but when it comes to boredome computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Also excersise is a big issue now and you aren't getting any by at a computer. On the other hand though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public. Also these w ebsites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Other pass time could be running on a tredmill or jogging there dont have benefits. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day but not using to the internet. Websites can be a way to find computer time. Edline is homework or an assignment. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive. Overall, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people if as many people that use computers balanced that time with time to excersise, they would all be better off.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 about what the world would be like without computers. Scary thought? I had the same reaction. A world without computers is a world of non-communicating people and no where to gather information independently. The benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that don't live in your area or that you just haven't talked to in a while. They also teach hand-eye coordination which is good for almost anything. Lastly, they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world. In conclusion, computers have outstanding effects on people. First of all, in my perspective, having a computer, allows me to communicate to people I've met on past vacations. I can email, them and talk to them on social networks such as facebook. This is benefical to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family. Being able to talk to friends I haven't spoken to in a white, gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect. In conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer, is only I, of the many benefits a computer has! Second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand-eye coordination as well. Dereck was a channel @NUM1 news reporter, "I can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. I truely @CAPS1 it's because my mother teached me now to use a computer! "@CAPS2 especially benefit from computers because they teach them hand-eye coordination which is great for those homeruns, or even touchdowns! Third of all computers allow students and many others to learn and look up things they don't know. @PERCENT1 of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research. On the other hand, businessman, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. Overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand-eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. As a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and a success for realiable information!
<START>

Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in "how to knit" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say "oh we will keep in touch," but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good far societey. One reason is kids cant write a @NUM1 page essay by hand the will use a computer because it is eascier. People use computers every day if it's not talking with friends playing games it peoples buenesness. I personally don't use a computer that often just to check my email and school work but that dosn't mean that people don't need them. People get excirsize even when they don't knew it like walking have so they are not of that. I personally believe that computers are not bad for but they can be helpful like a research projects like if you don't feel like looking book to find information you could go on a computer and look up somthig you could have the information at your finger tips. Why are peope so concerned about what we @CAPS4 with our. We excirsize nobody dosen't excersize we excersize at scheol when we walk home when we walk our dog take out the trash but thert might experience. Another great thing about computers is that you can video chat a live video chanel so that you can hear talk and see the person this is a great couse of if a paren is away on a burensness you can see them and talk to them I have used it to talk to friends as well. Coumpouters are also great thing becaus of the program that can with it the programs are word, excell, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 ex. They help you write essays, @CAPS4 grades, charts ex. Without coumpotors we would have to @CAPS4 it by hand wouldn't be neat it would be messy. Coumputer excersize your. The las reason why computers are so great the enternet because everthing is on the enternet like if you want to shop. Without the of your go fot it if you want to play games whatch videos you can chat with friends, post pictures, post videos I coiuld go on but I wont all I hope you the @CAPS1 got my point computors not bad for you an that's a fact kids love them and adults then so think I you took coumptor away from childre adults how would kids @CAPS4, how woud adulds fun busnesses think about what you would @CAPS4 to the world us theught computers.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people are talking about computers and what it does to us. People believe that using the computer is a waste of time. I believe that computers aren't a bad thing. Using the computers can help us learn about other places in the world. It can also show us the lives about people from the past. We can also talk to our friends online. If you want to know why computers are useful, just keep on reading. People say that computers waste our lives. I disagree with that opinion. The internet is a great way to learn about different places in the world. We can learn about the climate. The animals, and the food they eat. @CAPS1 palces have different types of culture. For example, in @LOCATION3 everyone eats seafood. In @LOCATION2, everyone eats spicy food. The internet can show us pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before. It's a great way to see and learn about different places compared to how you live. Do you have a friend that you haven't seen in a long time? Would you like to be in contact with that person again? Well the internet is a great way to do this. It allows you to make an account such as twitter, facebook, @NUM1 and more. You can search up your friends name and magic! You finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again. You would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again. @CAPS1 kids use the computer in order to do their history projects. Well the internet is here to help. You can search up famous people from the past or people from now adays. The internet allows you to see and learn about these people's past. One example is @LOCATION1. He was the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1. You can learn so much about him like where he was born, how @CAPS1 family relatives did he have and more. So you see, the internet is a great use for kids. These are my reasons in why I believe that computers aren't bad. We still have time for family, friends and any fun outdoor activity. We can learn about different places in the world. We can talk to friends online, and we can learn about people from the past.

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you think that computers have bad effect on people today? I know I don't. Over @PERCENT1 of people today have a computer. On a computer you can find great things about a place and people. If you don't have the best handwriting then you can type it and computer can help you look stuff up. @CAPS1 you want to go and look you your favorite hockey player? Instead of going to the library and hoping that theres a book on him. You can just @ORGANIZATION1 his name and hundreds of different websites using will came. That will save a lot of your day and it will save a lot of you money. If you go on a family trip each year to the sum. Place you need a change? Then you can look up another place online that @MONTH1 has the same features but it @MONTH1 be way closer then going to @LOCATION1 each year. So, if you have a computer then you can look places you @MONTH1 want to travel to or look up cool facts about your future sport player. If you have messy handwriting and its getting harder and harder for your teacher to read then you can just learn how to type it up on the computer. At least @PERCENT2 of students in schools today are getting zero on homewrok or test because their teacher can't read their hand writing. If you type it up on a s computer then you will spelling or grammar as you ever you for sizes and color as pictures are make your grade high to the fact you little more work into you die. So, to all the people who think that computer help anyone well reasons why computer can help someone. Computers can help kids find something or can help them computer can also find video about your favorite player or about you favorite hockey players give warning not the playoffs. You can find all good stuff online. You can find your favorite song for your cellphone. Over @PERCENT3 of people get the song from the computer. Also the computer can play the favorite song on the computer. For example if your favorite band was drop kick murpheys then you can @ORGANIZATION1 that are you will find all of their songs. Alot of people think that computer are not good for us. But, I say they are wrong. You can find info about there future person they can look up there. If you have messy handwriting then you can go and type it up lastly you can songs, video, and much more when you browse the web. For example, @LOCATION2, @MONTH1 be there very own website. Computer can help kids find info better we type your paper sloppy.

Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, Have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society? Well, for numerous people, computers are their lives. They help adults stay in contact with their friends. Also, it gives users usefull information about anything you can think of. Computers are a great tool to help us with our lives, they help us learn skills for later in life. People who use computers do not spend too much time on them, we need them to live a good life. For example, the internet has many websites that keep people in touch. There are countless sites and to name a few, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, the list goes on and on. Many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on. With computers, you can chat with each other all night. In @CAPS4, it is also a convienient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @LOCATION1. Moreover, computers are chock full of information. If a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. Also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the info for the report. Lastly if someone had an ailment and didn't know it was serious enough for a visit to the doctors office, they could look it up on the internet. they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as @ORGANIZATION2. Lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that these who don't will never have. Just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college. For instance, making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard. In @CAPS4 , typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. And using the computer fine tunes hand-eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 say that staring at a screen all day isn't healthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. Computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. The time has come to tell the people computers are usefull to society. They help social lives, teach us skills and, give us information on countless topics. People need them to have an enjoyable life. So, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @DATE1 and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them. 
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where nobody has any hand-eye coordination @CAPS6 they try to cath a ball it slips away. There are no friendships or communication with other countries. Is this really what you want? Computers do have positive effects on people. For example, they help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers have a positive effect on people and the society. First, hand eye-coordination is not something that all people have. However, you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact. Computers @CAPS4 said that computer help @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 with their hand-eye coordination. For example, my mom used to have horrible hand-eye coordination but now that she uses a computer and it is much better. Oprah said, “ @CAPS6 I was young I couldn’t catch a ball but now that I’m older and using computers I’m the best.” @NUM1 out @NUM2 people agree that computer help hand-eye coordination. Next, computers help other people learn about faraway places. For example, if we didn’t have computers people wouldn’t travel to @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 agree that they would never travel if it weren’t for computers it is a fact that people use the internet to learn about other countries for educational purposes. Www.exploretheworld.org wrote that @PERCENT2 of the people who use the website are students. Computers help other people learn about far away places. Finally, computers allow people to talk online. @PERCENT3 of people on facebook have at least one friend who live out of this country. It is a fact that countries are better allies @CAPS6 their people get along.Www.internationalfriendships.com wrote that they have over @NUM3 users who talk with people from other countries for example, my friend’s mother was born in @LOCATION2 and she talks online with many of her friends. Dr @PERSON1 said,”@CAPS8 friendships are the best kind because you learn about other cultures.” Computers are a wonderful way to talk to other people. Now @CAPS3 a world where every country got along because of online friendships. Where adults could play a game of baseball because they got their hand eye-coordination back. Where students could learn about distant places they didn’t know existed. Does't that sound great? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allow people to talk online. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers do benefit the society.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you know that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? Computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. Computers are taking away family time, exercise privledges, and time spent on school on school work. "@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!" @CAPS4 mom's will say this to childeren at least once as week, the answer that is @CAPS4 common is "@CAPS5!" @CAPS6 childeren from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer weather it's playing games or talking with friends. This is on issue that needs attention. Families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother that is always playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with @PERSON1 play computer. Aport from spending time with family computers take away @CAPS6 kids exercise privlidges. One example is that last week it snowed and I wanted my neigbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me but, she said had to finish a level on a computer game and it was realy important. This proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise. A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to @CAPS4 people except for @CAPS4 teenagers would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actualy spending time with them. Lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen. When does homework got done? I took a survey recently among the eighth grade and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of the people that don't do their homework are due to spending too much time on the computer. In my science class a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. I asked him why one day and he says it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. @CAPS5 time spent with family, @CAPS5 exercise getting done, @CAPS5 time to play outside, and missing homework assignment are alot to sacrifice for "@CAPS8 one more level." I you want to help me get childeren not spend so much time on computer, write on artical on this important issue in one of your newspaper and please consider my ideas.

@CAPS1 you want people to be over weight? @CAPS1 you wat our beautifal out doors to be ruined? And @CAPS1 you want familys to be distant because they are to pre @CAPS2? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of familys dont talk because they are to preocupied with computar games. The issue to grapple with is @CAPS1 computars have an affect on people. Yes, I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enought exersize, they dont enjoy the nature that we have, and they dont inter act with there family and friends. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enough exersize. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight spend more time on the computar than on the track. I remember a time when I was over weight be cause I spent to much time on the computar. One day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and I had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize. @CAPS1 you want kids to be over weight like I was? Many people dont get to enjoy the great out doors because they are to preocupied with the computar. Lisa, a volentere worker in @LOCATION1, says This feild used to be a vast array of plants and animal life, but now it is a waste land because of computars. No one had the time to worry of the natural wonder because they were to @CAPS2 with there computar animated jobs and didnt care what came of it. @CAPS1 you want this to happen to our country? @PERCENT4 of high technological places are dirty with very little plant life because the workers need to tend to the computars rather than the bushes. Some familys have a hard time talking about their dayly lifes becuse they spendin to much time on the computar and dont spend the time to talk and get to know each other. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 ofdevorces are related to not being able to have aconversation and with more technoligy on the way that number will grow. I remember that my parents got devorced because my dad spent more time on the computar than talking to me or my mom. Most people think that computars are good for research. Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house insted of in a big library with all the information you need. I think that computars have a negitive impact on people."

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that there is more and more controvosy about computer and whether they benefit society or not. In my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item. I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, they allow people to stay in contact with people they dont see very often, and they allow people to keep up and know whats going on in modern life. One reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they don't see very often. Today, parents don't mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1. This feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today. People in @LOCATION1 can talk with people in @LOCATION2. This type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they've discovered. Another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life. Many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. Some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. With computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. There is even at home colleges now where you take your class online. I believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only. Finally the last reason I believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet. There are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things. Also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @MONTH1 know a lot about the topic. Another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic, read history about it, and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more. Overall, I believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years. I believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge, the ability to keep in touch with others, and to keep in touch with modern life. I believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies. So, most people in a couple years will be computers and use them effectively.

Computers have gotten more advanced over time. They have even gotten smaller and smaller, and yet people still don't understand the dangers that computers have on society and their personal life such as; stress, addiction, and cyberbulling. I am here to write about how computers are a nuisense in our lives. First and for most, computers are one of the laeding causes of stress in daily life. About four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers. For example, if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes, would you be upset? Would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window? I'm pretty sure that you would because your data is lost, you will have to restart your computer and, worst case senerio, take your computer to the electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus. Hacking was @CAPS1 become a world wide sport. There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer and the government can't do much about that since the first amendment gives you the write to publish what you (freedom of speech and press). Just look what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors will cause major stress in you daily life. Secondly, people spend too much time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer. This make them less social meaning they won't spend time with friends, family, or even try out for sports. They won't get the recommended one hour of exercise a day.

Many people debate on whether on net computers have negative effects on them @CAPS1 believe have negative effects on them @CAPS1 believe computers are an asset to society because you can access almost anything. That is the problem. The content on computers is affilicted upon everyone that sees it, Computers also don't help people get healthir, anf if you need to research something books are more help than the internet. For starter, the contents on computers and the internet are too much for people and society. @CAPS4 I'm saying is way too much can be accessed on the internet. Derrogatory and pornagraphic websites harm people the @CAPS1 especially @ORGANIZATION1 and teens. Chinese government officials have cut off access to the @CAPS1 dangerous websites. Chinese readers started "@CAPS3 belive the things that are easily accessed on computers are poisoning the minds of the youth." The internet and computers are  waiting to explode and invade the minds of everybody. Secondly, computers aren't metally from computers but physically unstable also. Computers offer of games for @ORGANIZATION1 to play. These games start off fun but they become habits. Don't get me away though games can be fun but when a child plays a game for hours a day there is a problem. The problem is that kids are not getting enough of the exercise they need. Studies performed by the @ORGANIZATION1  know that @PERCENT1 of child who play computer generated games are overweight. Therefore I believe games are harmful habit to young @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, many people do research on the internet. but some facts are actually @CAPS4 im getting is that no one need a computer to look up or do research on projects. Instead go to a library. Many find books boring but it will help in the long . I remember a time when i had a project dure for @PERSON1's in @NUM1 grade on @LOCATION1. I looked up information on the internet instead of using a book just to learn that the facts were actually highly in accurate . Therefore, never depend on the internet as a source of research. from derragatory content, to unhealthy youth, to innacurate research. Computers are not assets to society but issues. In my opinion i believe computers are actually doing more harm than good to everbody that uses them.

Dear Local Newspaper, "@CAPS1 people have any viruses in there head?" @CAPS2 they need a maricle to pop up away from the computer. Why I stated that is @CAPS2 its unhealthy for many people. Its not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don't want to be in. Stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get of the computer! It's unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead he just sit there online everyday eating. Another reason why its unhealthy is, as you get older your bone's get weaker and when your old you can't move lik you use to and want to. Man just think, if we didn't have a computer, all the time/money people spend on computers can be spent for stuff more useful. For example @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love computers more than life itself. @PERCENT1 of the world spend their time doing somthing active instead of being on the computer." @CAPS3 an computer is nice but you got to know that you, can't get controlled by it. ALERT! ALERT!!! Sirence is getting closer and closer to my house. I am getting scared @CAPS2 I am online and i'm wondering if i did anything wrong. But it wasn't me who the cops was coming for, it was my next door neighbor. I guess he was doing illegal stuff online that he had no buisness doing. See computer's can get you into trouble. For example, I remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me. Now, you know why computers effect people. How unhealthy it is, to many people. Why it takes up so much time from people's life. And all the trouble it puts people through.

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 are a major part in everyday life. They are used by just about everybody. There are so many benefits if you know how to use one propurly. They help you through everyday life whether your trying to find this song that is stuck in your head or trying to file you taxes, computers are a nececity in every house hold. They are also a great way to learn. You can look up a question that has been buging you or you could learn to play a new song on your favorite instrement. Either way your learning. So I think that computers deffinetly have more of a positive effect on society then a negative one. Computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends. Some computers even have built in cameras that lets you hold conversations with peers through the computer while seeing each other. This is great if you have family that lives far away, or your in a long distance relationship. Another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things. Wheither it been @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 you can count on your computer to keep it all organized some computers also have a built in callendar that could help you plan out your day. But say you don't know what to do that day. Well that brings me to my next point. Computer are also great for looking up places. For instance say you fly to @LOCATION1 for the first time on a buisness meeting and you arrive a few days before the meeting. So maybe you diside to go sight seeing to some of @LOCATION1's most eligant spots, but have a computer you could look up some spots and be on your way to having a great day. Overall I think that computers make the world go round. They will never die out, that is why everybody should know how to use one, and if you don't you should hurry and learn as soon as possible.
<START>

I think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people and even allow people to talk with other people. My first reason, is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life. The people that use computers have important jobs. For example, a judge, an enginere, a lawyer, an archytecht, a scientist, an archeologist etc... This is why I think that computer are helpfull for people. My second reason, is that computer could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school. It could help develop a smarter brain in many ways. The first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute. It helps by knowing the meaning of new words. I helps you speak correctly and clear. That is why I think that computers help develop a smarter brain. My third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world. That could be a hobby for adults that does not have something to do could have a good time. My conclusion is that with computer you could have a better life. Computers could help you get a better future.

Dear conneticut @CAPS1, you like to catch up on your favorite television showscar shop for the latest trends? Or maybe even planning out a get together with some of your old friends? Well with todays great technology you can do that on the computer! I can see that the experts are trying to decide whether or not computers are the healthiest thing that benefits our society but in my opinion I think they are great! As you @MONTH1 not know I am @NUM1 years old and have a @NUM2 year old brother; we spend alot of time on the computer not just for homework. I like to shop online for discounts and sales where I know thing are cheaper than in stores. I know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games. My grandparents are older and don't watch alot of tv and read the Newspaper so the computer is great for catching up on your favorite tv shows and or the news. With these great pieces of machinery you can chat up a storm with old friends on facebook, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION3. @PERCENT1 of teens @CAPS5 are shopping by brand names, like: @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4. All of these clothes and designer stuff is everything we want, but half of us don't have the money. If you go on the computer you can get all of these names and items for less than @MONEY1 compared to %@NUM3. Computers lower the price of things we want and need. I, @CAPS5 a days grandparents try to have a decents conversation with their kids or grandchildren but they go right vack to when they were little. As a grandchild to my @PERSON1 all she used to talk about was her days going through the great deppresion, but with computers she got to catch up on the news and @CAPS5 I can sit down with her and have a great conversation. You can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school. The kids won't be missing out! When I was in @NUM4 grade I got my first facebook, I thought I was so could! That @DATE1 I went to camp and met all these new kids and found out that they all have facebooks. @CAPS5 I keep in touch with them, with out lossing my friendships. You see, I know the scientists or experts are probably smarter than a @NUM1 year old girl but I know that most teenaters and parents have facebook and say its great because we connect with people around the world. So I know these experts are going to make the best dicision on whether or not computers benefit our society but please take my ideas into consideration.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The issue before us is that people are addicted to computer. S I think we are not. In addition to all this some people can task and many things like hang out with there family and friend but most importantly enjoy life. In a way computer privliges can be as like your enjoying life. Say if you an your friend has the same computer which includes webcam, video messaging and more. That's life well what im trying to say is that yall can talk see each other, have private conversations. Computer's dont alway take you away from the important people or things in life. Some computers can help you, you can take school, learn how to write essays, learn how to read, and much more. Computers can be a success to some people. Only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer. Imagine life without a computer what would you do? How can you survive? For example if you were giving some homework that you had to do on the computer and theres was no way for you to do that project in school. How would you do it? Some people need computers. I think if they thought and knew we was going to get so excited about how cool our computers' are they shouldnt so much new technologies in our life. Now you can probably see why I think we need computer and how it can sometime benefit our society.

@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one @ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a @ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First @ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students' handwriting. I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think computers @MONTH1 cost too much, but you @CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I know that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree.

I agree with the computers helping people. To start with, computers have a possitive affect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Also it allows people to talk online from far away places. So, yes, computers are good for people. First of all, computers do have a possitive affect. The computer @MONTH1 give some one motivation. Or it will help someone find their lost pet. Also it could help you get a job. Plus you can find a safe home with it. So, ya computers do have a possitive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. Also you can get information on places you will visit. This will help learn about diffrent contrays. Most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. This concluds that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for familys. Also people who have hospitilized family. Plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a possitive affect on people. They given us ability to learn! Lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away. So, in conclution, it is a benifit for people to use the computers!

Dear readers, People around the world are starting to use computers now more, often, but theirs also people that dont agree that it benefits society, @CAPS1 not one of those people. I agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is because sometimes theirs teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they cant contact them in any other way. Another reason is because in all school teacher give their students project to do over vacation or weekends, for the projects they can look for information in the computer. The last reason is because computers can give ability to learn more about things they didnt know before. In my opinion I agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids and even adults would like to talk with their friends so they can get on the computer and chat with them if theirs no other way to contact them, @CAPS2 easy. You only have to @NUM1) get in the computer, @NUM2) get into a site were you know your friend might be @NUM3) log in or register in if you never been into that site @NUM4) last but not least look @NUM4 your friend to chat will teachers always give their students work for example like projects. Kids also do projects on weekends or vacation and so you dont have to go to a library to check out a book you could always get on the computer and look for the information you need their. Computers give you abilitys to learn information you didnt know before for example if your bored and you dont got nothing to do get in the computer and look up information about things like nature, books your looking for etc. I agree with computers benefiting society but not everyone, @NUM3 reason why I agree is kids can chat online with their friends, look up information for projects and find information they never knew about, what do you think @CAPS1 I right or wrong.

Dear State legistator, @CAPS1 you live back a long time ago when there were no computers. The only diffrence now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder. I deffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone elses lifes easier. With the computer it teaches hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I belive the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from “@CAPS2 drivers.com” the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decraced over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like “@CAPS3” a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pa. the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in “@CAPS4-tech” magazine. I should also add in it has reconected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online. So do me a favor state legislator relize and come to terms how much society needs the computer.
<START>

I think computers have a good effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordiantion, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and allow them to talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. This will be used through out people lives. WIthout hand-eye coordination people will be clumsey. Hand-eye coordination is used from day to day everyday. Using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time. For people who do not have good hand-eye coordiantion this will be a big help. They will be able to do more thing without messing up. Like hitting a baseball! For kids who want to play sports this could acually help. They will learn to use there eyes, arms, and hands to there advantage. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places. If we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world. Also if you have family in a faraway place you will be able to look online and see what is happening there. If something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them. Also to be able to learn about faraway places will help in school. If you have a report to do on of faraway place instead of looking through you can look on the internet for information. Computers also allow people to talk online with other people. This gives more comunication. You will be able to make more friends and better friends. To have the opportuniy to talk to people online is great. You can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot. Also you will become a lot more interactive with people. If you are a shy person this can help you. You will get used to talking to people and when you get comfortable you will talk to them in real life. This will make you a lot more friends. This will help you come out of your shell and become a lot more interactive around people. These are three reasons why I think computers are a good thing. They help hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and allow you to talk online with other people.

Dear, local newspaper, @CAPS1 you like computers? I @CAPS1, computers help you learn about all kinds of things. Plus computers let you chat to people on there computer even if you can't call them. Another reason why I love computer are because when I have to write a project I can just type it!!! Computers make eveything easier. So, @CAPS2 consider liking computers. Initially, imagine you have a project due in two days. Your mom can't drive you to the library and you have no information on the subject. But hey, don't you have a computer. You can use the computer to lock up your subject and a @CAPS3 different websites will come speed quick to your screen. Most of then will help you learn about the subject and then you have time to finish it and hang out with your friends. Secondly, @CAPS4 @CAPS5!!! you frogot what page of the book your suspose to read. Also you lost all your friends contacts. Not to fear super duper computer is here. You can email or chat to your friends online and see what pages to read and get there phone numbers back. Did you know @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 People said that the chat & email programs are @CAPS6 because they can contact friends, family, and co-workers. Finally, you can type your essay on the computer. Writing a @NUM2 paragraph essay takes to long, so use your computer to help you out. Go to microsoft office and type your essay. Computers make writing an essay really easy. @PERCENT2 out of @NUM3 people said they like typing on the computer more then writing it on @CAPS7. in conclusion, Computers are @CAPS6 tecnollogy when you have to chat to someone. Also when you learn about something. Another reason why computers are @CAPS6 is because you can type essays & papers, @CAPS8, @CAPS2 change you @CAPS10 of computers are bad to computers make us @CAPS11!

To whom it @MONTH1 concern; I am writing this to let you know how I feel about the effects computers have on people. My opinion on this topic is; I think that both statements are true, yes they give people the ability to learn about faraway places & people & also allow people to talk on line with others. If we did not have computers I would not have finfished many of my school process and homeworks. But the experts who are spending too much time on thier computers & less time exercising enjoying nature & interacting with family and friends. I know this is true because I know some peopel who have gotten addicted to online video games & wouldn't leave the computer for hours & I know I myself have found new website & want to learn all about it so I'll be on the computer instead of exercising. But even with both statement being true; I do not think computers efefcet on people. Because without computers alot more students would be failing classes & getting zeros// @CAPS1's on projects; class asignments & homework. Becayse they dont have a quick way to look up all their information. Also most families or friends will lose contact because they lost a fun way to communicate. i think computers have a positive effect. Don't you?

Dear local newspaper, I beileve that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I beileve that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the @PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use internet know that poeple need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone dosen't want to be bothered then don't bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privleged for a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad.

Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life, they help with many things. Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I @CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: "I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay orginized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, "my dog ate my homework" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without earasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get @CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you @MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are @CAPS1, ext. No more, "I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to @CAPS1 what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a dobt, no more, "I'm bored". @CAPS1 you use your computer to @CAPS1 anything like this? If so you must enjoy it. People use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings. Now what side are you at?

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 years computers didn't exist, but now many people are having internet in their homes. But to some, the effect its giving on the people is negative. However, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. Such as, the internet allows people to keep in touch, gives them technology skills to prepare them @CAPS1 more hi-tech jobs; and allows them to find and learn about new things. Dont you think computers help society? People live in all parts of the world, and those that are lucky get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country. But, you can't talk on the phone due to long-distance calls; so with a computer people don't have to lose touch! Its quite easy @CAPS1 people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them. Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family, too. Therefore, people can talk to their distant relatives from all over when you don't even have to go visit them. Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch. Lets face it, the world is relying more and more on technology and computers. But, if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job. Lots of jobs ask @CAPS1 technological skills in order to be hired; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults @CAPS1 life. Besides that, there is a computer injust about every work place that is up-to-date; restaurants, hotels, retail stores. and even in construction business. Nevertheless, computer skills aren't just a good skill to have; they are a necessary skill. Last, Computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics. Instead of looking through various books and encyclopedias @CAPS1 researching, why not search the topic? Although, the computer and internet shouldn't completely replace books, it is a valuable researching tool. Someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures, ancient history on them, and learn so much. Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house. Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people. @CAPS1 the reasons of keeping intouch, giving

Computers can take a lot of a person's time, but there are also benefits to having one. You could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor. The computer is the smartest thing youll ever see. All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your facebook, twitter, or myspace and tell them your running late. It's @DATE1, no one writes letters anymore; there's e-mail and instant messaging. Letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over. When you type, all you do is hit "backspace" and you write over only your mistake. Letters also take forever to recieve, while instant messeges come, well, instantly! Haven't seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are being made with webcams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be talking with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor. Don't think that's enough? If you explored the computer, then you'd find it can help you with a lot more than just learning and interaction.

Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don't have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can't do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can't. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect.

Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don't fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines.

Dear newspaper, I think that computers are great for researching things like for a car or sereach for people places and thing. @ORGANIZATION1 are great because you keep in touch with you family and friends. Like you can email them webcam chat and you can instant message them.I think a lot of people should get into @ORGANIZATION1 because you can do everything on them. You can save you picture, download music, play games. People say that some people spend to much time on the @ORGANIZATION1 well i think they should because they should learn new and different things about different countrys city or even states. I don't think there is noting wrong about spending time on a @ORGANIZATION1.

Dear Local Newspaper, People all around the globe are using computers! Some people think this is a bad idea but I disagree. I believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style. Computers help people stay in touch, computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways. Computers definitly help people keep in touch. There is @CAPS1, myspace, twitter, facebook, email, and even video chat. For example, my cousin is in @LOCATION1 a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat. Without this, we would have no communication with him. Many people around the world use computers to communicate. This is how people use computers to stay in touch. Also, computers are amazing now and they're only going to get better. If computers are so great now, just imagine what they will be like in @NUM1 or @NUM2 years. Plus, the more people buy and use computers the more company are going to want to invent new ones. As you can see computers are only going to get better. The last reason I would like to share with you today is that computers help kids tromendously. On average, about @PERCENT1 of kid in the @CAPS2.S use a computer every day. Kids use it to talk to friends, play games, do homework and to do many other things as well. Also, kids and adults just use computers if they need to know how to do something or even find places in their town. This is how kids are helped out by computers. As you can clearly see, computers are used all around the world for many different reasons. They help to stay in touch, they're only going to improve, and the help kids. Everyone is using computers, shouldn't you?

Dear local newspaper, I strongly belive that computers don't benefit society as much as people think. I think that nature can provide all of the same qualatys than any computer can. A computure can not provide fitness, real interactions with friends of family, or experience in the real world. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children in @LOCATION2 are overweight because of a lack of exercising? Acording to @CAPS1 @PERSON1. a @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1, computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise. So why would a system that leads to obesity be considered a benefit to sociaty? Anotherthing on that topic is that overweight children that spend @NUM1 hours. Put off healthy activatys such as basketball or tennis wich also leaves them socialy behind and lacking he healthy experiences wich leads me to my next point. People think that computers know everything, but the truth is that their are vary little things you can experience on a computer. For example you @MONTH1 read about world war @CAPS2 but you realy know what people were thinking or what the combat fealt like? A computer can not teach you how to feal only a real life experience can do so. Many if you were deployed to an army write in @LOCATION1. You would know what its like to be in war. but playing a game or reading an article don't provide experience. My @NUM2 explamation for how computers are not the greatest affect on scociaty is true life interactions with your family and friends. Their is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally. People claim that they talk to their friends and family over the @CAPS3 all the time but the only why to be satisfied is by seeing them for real for example a romantic relationship would fail if the only way they communicated was threw the @CAPS3. Unlike most relationships that sucseed. I hope my letter to your newspaper will get peoples attention, I would apretiate it if you joined my cause and help protect scociaty from dangerous computure technology that could cause, obesity, bad relations, and inexperience.

Computers are great technology, but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives! Computers cause children to fail and lose their exercize. The children also put their self in danger by joining a few different websites. Don’t waste your time in a boring computer screen! I am almost @PERCENT1 positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their back packs in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. My mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @CAPS1, when he would only go one @NUM1 minutes a day to talk to family members. Now, my mom created a @CAPS1, that @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was gona only go on to with the family, but @CAPS2 plays all the pointless applications, such as, "cafe world." @CAPS2 waste her time on @CAPS1 whenever @CAPS2 is home, when @CAPS2 could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. Something I havent mentioned is, I use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didnt go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I relized after I got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. My dad then disconected my @CAPS4, and I beleive my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconecting the @CAPS4, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @CAPS3 home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, "blogtv.com." were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing! Stop wasting your life people! Go out and have fun, dont let the @CAPS4 keep you home. The @CAPS4 is unsafe and pointless.
<START>

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer? Too many is my geuss! They are warping the minds of people all over, and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, and say that computers help children who are in school. That @MONTH1 be true, but honestly only a couple decades ago the average student didnt even own a computer, and school were teaching the same materials without the usage of them. Also, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays, and I'm sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools. Another reason computers @MONTH1 not benefit society is because of the dangers of them. Sexual predators sworm the internet, and many people talk to strangers over the internet that @MONTH1 be harmful, without even realizing it. A third reason computers @MONTH1 not be help society @CAPS2 you can see, I feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society, for many reason. I hope you can agree with me 
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like @CAPS2 you were to write rection on computers. They teach @LOCATION3 faraway places, help build hand-eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk online. Computers are part of everyday life and needs to be told about. First, computer let @LOCATION3 learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. One of my mom's friends, They decide to move to @LOCATION2 she didn't like computer so didn't look at @LOCATION2's laws saying, I'll find out when I got there. "@CAPS2 did find out the laws she didn't find enough cause cause she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few monthes after her last arrest she came back to the @LOCATION3 where she could deal with the laws. @LOCATION2 is a buetifull country and all of arrests were accidents because she didn't know the laws. Ten minutes on computer searching the laws in @LOCATION2 could have kept her in @LOCATION1. Next, comptures improve hand-eye coordination. From a survey @PERCENT1 of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. @PERSON3, a gym teacher at the @ORGANIZATION2 says, "@CAPS3 of these kids that spend time on the compture are weak and need to get some exercise.Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT2 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, "I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS5, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on." @CAPS5, the people agree with what @PERSON2 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but @CAPS2 you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, @CAPS2 you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because @CAPS2 you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS5, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS5, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever @CAPS2 you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot! From so many students having greater hand-eye cooridination they will enjoy what their good at like tennis. @PERSON1, a professor of the human body at @ORGANIZATION1 states "Technology helps hand-eye. Many who use computers more than others to be greater at @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and games along those lines." This shows how hand-eye and exercise is linked to computer. Furthermore, computers help @LOCATION3 talk with other people. When a child goes to college they will still be able to email their famlies and talk to them. Talking with others by computers makes the world go round. World business need computers to contact eachother to decuss plans on how to move toward economicly. Lastly, computers are useful and should be useful more. They teach @LOCATION3 of faraway places, improve hand-eye coordnation, and let @LOCATION3 talk to other people. @CAPS2 an article is made to show the pros or computers, more people will experience the wonders of them.

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are used everyday by millions of people. I believe that the technology of computers have a positive effect on people. I think computers have a positive effect on people because people use them for research. People use computers to communicate with people far away. Computers are even used as a news resource. In my opinion, computers make things easier. Computers have a positive effect on people because they are very helpful. You can use computers to research different things. @CAPS1 you have a computer, you can learn new things about places you never knew existed. For example, @CAPS1 you have a homework assignment, you don't have to use a book to get information, you can just use your computer. So, for those reasons, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are always being used for several things. However I think people used computers the most for communication. On a computer you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states. Instead of sending letters to people by mail, now a days people use e-mails and instant message. You can talk to people faster this way and it's much easier. Computers have a positive effect on people. It's makes some things in life much easier. I don't understand why they would have a negative effect on people. It's the year @DATE1, and computers are used for basically everything. Remember how we used to have to read the newspaper to find out about breaking news and important things? Well, since we have computers a lot of people don't read newspaper. On the computer you can read the whole newspaper, and even find out more about things that happen in our world. So what's the point of even reading the newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? I believe computers have a positive effect on people's life because you can do anything on the computer. You can research information, commmunicate with people, and use it as news resource. Doesn't that make lif a lot easier? So why do some people think computers have a negative effect on people?
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 your computer daily can be a waste of your life. Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercsing and enjoying nature, distract you from human nature things such as communicating, and can also waste tons of energy. Picture yourself, sitting at your desk, talking to some friends online. Take away your computer and all youre doing is sitting thhere, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, [expect your fingers of ] @CAPS2't you think you should be doing something more usefull in your life? Such as taking a walk and enjoying nature? That's what I thought. Nature is beautiful. So @CAPS4 enjoy it throug h a window next to your desk? obesity is a problem in @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are considered "fat" @CAPS4 would you even think about spending your day simply sitting in a chair? Go to the gym and loose some of that extra body weight! Communicating through @CAPS5's is so over-rated, people can't express their emotions! all they can do is send a smily face or happy face. Communication wih only your friends can cause you to miss out on things. For example, lets say there is a cancelation at your work place on the news, but you @CAPS2't see it cause you were @CAPS6-ing with your friend. @CAPS6? @PERCENT2 of people @CAPS2't even "laugh out loud" @CAPS7 they send that to their friends. Plus you @MONTH1 even go to your friends, house and instead of laughing, you'l say @CAPS6. Are instead of gasping, you say, "@CAPS9!" I mean come on people, get out and really "communicate" @CAPS10, so you bought one of those new lights? Too bad youre not even saving any energy by @CAPS1 that computer of yours daily. @CAPS1 that @CAPS11, uses about the same amount of energy in as @NUM1 regular light bulbs in @NUM2 hours, @CAPS12 that light really saving you that much money. Haven't you heard? the economy is bad, which means we @CAPS2't have alot of money which means YOU playing online games is wasting energy, which is wasting money. Someones going to have to work overtime this week, and it's not me. I @CAPS2't think hair spray is the cause of the layer being destroyed... Computers are bad, and dont have a good enough reason to be used. They take enjoying nature, reduse your communication levels, and not to mention, waste a lot of energy. Therefore, my point is made.
<START>

I belive the reason why people use the computer so much is because most people might have to work on the comptuer or mabey even finish a project. But I understant the part when the artical said "Some experts are concerned that people are spending to o much time on their computes and less exercising". Mostly young teens use the computer at a earley age and become hooked, because there are so many things to do on the computer like download games for free and play with other. People around the world but you would think that anybody would play video game on the computer and have free time? NO! Most adults don't play games on the computer, they do work or reasearch an artical. But after that they'll continue doing their daily routine, but alot of teens are on the computer everyday and rarley get exercise. The internet has open alot of new enchanced technology, over the past few years you could search up old friends from mabey old schoold on the web or even chat with people who you don't know from all over the world. You could have an @NUM1 @CAPS1 and buy new song or new albums insted of going to a local store, or even shop online have have the cloths been brought to you. Over the years they would of never done that, and rent movies or buy them to have on your @CAPS2.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 on a beautiful sunny day, people inside on their computers instead of enjoying the weather. This is what could happen if people are using them. I believe that computers have a bad effect on people because their communication skills will drop, people won't get enough exercise & their health can be imnarred. As i mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis, will drop their communication skills.. People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to. For example, if i logged onto & chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number & your name. This could lead to things such as kidnaping & even rape. Also, interactions with family members & friends @MONTH1 decrease. You can be playing a computer game, online, or going on youtube to watch random videos of people. You tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children. Kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on when click the wrong one bringing them inapropiate website. Finally, teenagers and adults go onto facebook & twitter. Some @MONTH1 say these sites @MONTH1 change the social interactions, but it really isn't. Kids & adults are constantly getting addicted to it. Also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal. People don't need to know when you do things in your day i have keep up this our communication skills are sure to decrease. Secondly, exersice is a problem. Doctors say that @PERCENT1 of their parents are obeise or over weight according to @ORGANIZATION1. Kid just sit at home & play computer games such as sims @NUM1 & video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them. No one really goes for walks any more either. Also, people don't go out & enjoy nature like the you. @PERSON1, a state @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2 said, "each year the number of people are getting fewer & fewer. Preety soon all parks are going to have to get closed down." @CAPS2 don't want this to happen, do you? I know i would not. Our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced. Finally, more & more people are becomeing unhealthy. A person's eye sight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer everyday. My aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work. She went to her eye doctor because her vision was become weaker. One of the first questions he aske was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? she answered yes. He said she would need cataraks eye surgery. This was all in result of using a computer. Finally, you could get althritis in your hands & fingers from typing & using the mouse all the time. Many people at the age of fourty are probaly going to need hand surgeries from all the work the do, likes! As you can see technology is harming your communication skills, exersice & you health. I bet you don't want your future generations like this. So take a part & contact your local newspaper today.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy a lot of people's time which could be used for other matters. The internet also contains alot of unappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many petafiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in america is climbing. There is no doubt that electronics, play a huge role in this event. For example my brother plays on the computer everyday, so barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also there is alot of content. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornagraphy. most sites don't even alert you that by how you need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very little acctually ask for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children as a young teens. Its truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and. Petafiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive, to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location, and to commit rape. Some victims are enough speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet. For these reasons I say that computers have a negative effect computers lives because some positive but sadly cons outweight pros such as before mention occupation of time, content on the internet. I truly believe that the planet would be better with out computers.

I think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversal issue. In my opinion, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. For instance, it's not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet. Also, people spend too much time in front the computer now a days, @CAPS1, its a major distraction and also a negetive effect on kids. school work. It's now or never! Do we dicide that computers have a negetive effect? You decide! Isn't every parents biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up. Would you want your child veiwing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like @CAPS2.com one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least @NUM1 to have a @CAPS2, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users lie about their age? And it's not always a @NUM4 year old saying they are @NUM1, it could be a @NUM6 year old saying they're @NUM7! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are. Is this the kind of internet exposer you want for your children? Put a stop to this right now! More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are overweight and unhealthy. This is another negetive effect computers have on people. It's a gorgeous @DATE1 day. Bright blue skies, cotton candy cloulds, the sun is shining, and there's a nice warm breece. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! None people would @CAPS5 be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would @CAPS5 spend hours on facebook. This is a serious concern to our health. People don't exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! Instead of playing video games onlin, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun beighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step @CAPS3 need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn't you agree? Did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negetive effects of a computer this will @CAPS5 than coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study. So you do! Take action now, or your child will definately suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe Computers have a negative effect on people? It's clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negetively affect children's grades. Don't wait another minute! Let's agree and do something about this!

Dear @PERSON1, Computers are very helpful in daily activities, but computers have a bad side. Some users are addicted to their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, they are away from friends and family, and they are not exersizing it if fun to use the @CAPS4 but you should not use it too much! Some people are almost addicted to their @CAPS4. I cant blame them they can charge their ipod, tweet, listen to music, palying games and much more all at the same time! computers are great, but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of activities. People almost feel (some do) that they HAVE to go on facebook to harvest their crops in farmtown, or control their @LOCATION1 on @CAPS3. They get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities. It shouldn't  that for but its became an epidemic, eveybody is being sucked into their computers! People who are on their @CAPS4 @NUM1 are away from their friends and family! they are like oh i haven't talked   his surgery i wonder how he is! Lets see! They go on and  You can talk to someone in just a click! Talking to someone  facebook or twitter is no the same as talking to them in person! Its like people think computers is     @CAPS4 take people away from their friends and family and them talk only on facebook  .When people on the @CAPS4 they become lazy! A person who is @CAPS4 addict will say " @CAPS5 supposed to go to they gym but let me check my twitter first!" two hours later then they go the gym! People don't exercise as often as the should! When people are going to lay on the @CAPS4 for @NUM2 minutes it takes @NUM3 hours! They have to sign in, chat with their friends, check their mail look at their tweets look at their restaurnat  check out videos on youtuve and do all other kinds of things! Computers are good but have sideeffects getting addicted, being away from friends and family, and not exercising. @CAPS4 addicts should minimize their time on the @CAPS4!

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 are worried that people are on the computer way to much and don't spend enough time outside enjoying nature or exercising. I wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer. First, kids and even adults can talk to there friends online. Your popley thinking that the kids already some there friend at school but what @CAPS2 their moved. They could have moved to a different city, State or even cuntry and the only @MONTH1 to connect with them is by They can't call each other @CAPS2 they really far away that would be a pretty phone bill. Seventy five percent of people talk to thier friends through computer. About half of the people are talking to friends who live in another state. or country. Do you really want people to lose their friends? Next, people can actually make new friends in the computer, like pen pals. Pen pals are people you write to but they don't live in the state as you or sometimes not even the same country. assignment at school but you can do it on your @CAPS2 your pen pal doesn't live in the same country as you and doesn't speak fluend @CAPS3 you can teach them @CAPS3 and they can teach you these language. Finally, there's away for kids to go on the You could a limit on thier computer time Some wants to paly a game on the "@CAPS5 you can play on the computer away from her the next day. @CAPS2 wants to go on the computer that day and throws a ten turn the parent should take the computer away for the next and so on and so on. Once your child finally cooperates they will get the to use the computer. As you can see there are meny things to do on the computer from talking to far away friends to making new friends a computer schedule. Thank you for taking you time to read this letter.

Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function @CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, "I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload @CAPS8 @CAPS3." @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, "@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics." A lawyer said, "You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is on @MONEY1 those tools." @CAPS4, @CAPS8 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper @CAPS8 a @CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, "Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom." @CAPS8 internet, citizens @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, @CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way @MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and @CAPS8 online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people each. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 @MONEY1 them said online. "@CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet @MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!" said a person interviewed. Airports make @MONEY1 for the @LOCATION2 government, and @CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways @MONEY1 booking transportation. @CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me.

Dear @PERSON1, The advansing technology is showing a very negative affect on people. Because of computers people are spending too much time on computer and less time doing things that are better for them. First, spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways. For example, looking at a bright computer screan for more than @NUM1 min at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. The brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision. Also, if you spend all of your time indoors and on the computer you will not get the exersize you need. @PERSON1, were you aware that for every @NUM2 min you are on the computer you should spend @NUM2 min outside. It is very important to get fresh air, sunlight, and exersize. Moreover, another problemwith computers is that you don't get as much interaction with people. With online chatting you can't know what the other person is feeling like, @PERSON1, or if you are even talking to other person you think you're talking to. It is much better to interact with people in person, face to face. To have good social health you need to hang out with friends, and laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. @PERSON1, people need to interact with real people. Furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people. For example, @PERSON1, say you needed to type up an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a min, or look something up, or talk with a friend. You say that it will only take a minute and then you with type the article. But when you stop all of a sudden you played for @NUM4 hours. Then you have to stay up later to finish. Computers are extremely distracting. People of all ages have this problem of being distracted by computers and not gettind work done. In conclusion, computers, although an advance in technology, have very negative side affects. @PERSON1, I feel that it is our job to tell the people of the negitive side effects of computers. It is our job to help people over come the side affects of computers. Please @PERSON1, we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have.

Dear local Newspaper I ting that computers are good because u get to learn about other people like famous people that deid a long time ago. Computers are good because u get to learn about other places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, texas. Learning about other places is fun. Having a computer is good because u get to serf the web you could play games, see and alot of other times you will like. You could talk to frends from far. Talking from mySpace or yahoo and other website that you could talk to tiferent people that you met trew the wed.

Man has always been interested in technology. Computers are just one part. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, saves trees, and allows people to learn about everything. Hand-eye coordination is a key part in our every day lives. Driving a car or writting all invile hand-eye coordination. I remember a few years ago I didn't have a great hand-eye coordination I had trouble catching a ball. Now days I spend up to on hour and a half on the computers. I have noticed my hand get neater and I can catch a balls with ease now. Do you want to be the one to crash your car because you have bad hand-eye coordination? Computers not only increase your hand-eye coordination they save trees too. Using a computer dosn't need any paper. You can read and write with out using a single sheet of paper. Since the computer @PERCENT1 of tree cutting has stopped. Saving trees help us stay alive. Trees put out the oxegyn that we breath in. Some say that computers are causing people to spend less time enjoying nature. I think that if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't have much nature to enjoy anyway. Lastly computer help people all around the world learn about almost anything. I scince kid, the head scientist says that "with the computer we are able to toll the world of our discoveries much." @CAPS1. @PERSON1 say "@CAPS2 many people are laying had their die to the computer, they learn @CAPS2 many nutrition facts from the health sites". Thanks to the computer we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed. The average people can learn about non average things any day. There are even dictionarys on the internet with many diffent translations that you would normily need about @NUM1 books to do. The computer is one of the greatest techlonagicly advances to this day. It has help our world is @CAPS2 many different ways too. Hand-eye coordination is @CAPS2 important and is preserving our environment. If you don't have knowledge you cant get anywhere in life. Our whole world senses is.

Guaranteed, @NUM1 years from now we will still be using computers they are probably talking to friends, doing research on something or are typing up something for @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are wonderful and let us do so many things that we can't do by ourselves. Without computers life as we know it would probably be way different. Firstly, computers let us talk to our friends and family. Allowing us to communicate to one another without us leaving the safety of our homes. See, just recently a girl in @CAPS1 went over her friends' home to do their homework together. When they were done the girl tried to walk home, and she was never seen again. With computers we can do homework with our friends without leaving our homes. Clearly, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Secondly, computers let us do research about stuff we don't know about. Allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that maybe not have the info. you're looking for if it was to search @ORGANIZATION1 it would give me a map pointing out it's location and the schools website where I can find out my homework for that night. As you can see the computer allows ud to do things that would take us far more longer to do regularly. Without a doubt, without computers life as we know it would probably be way different @CAPS2, Computers allow us to do homework on it wether it's research or just typing something up, it lets us do more capable things. Most of our daily homework is on the computer. Just @DATE1 we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our @ORGANIZATION1. So far in @NUM2 grade almost every night our homework is on the @CAPS3 if we were to forget to write down our homework we would have another to get this information. Obviously, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Furthermore, computers are on advancement in technology that this uses constantly. Computers let us look up valuable info. on things around the world. They let us talk to friends and family around the world. They @CAPS3 help us achieve great things in @ORGANIZATION1, wether it be homework or classwork. Without them it would take double to triple the amount of time to do something without them. Finally, I believe that people who are against them just haven't used them in the correct manner.

I think the effects of the computer are bad, these are my three reasons why I think its bad; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time or hours on their computers, @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers, @CAPS3, people need to use computers out a less time. These are the three reasons why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that computer could cause couse blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers because the screen of the computer has too much light, people can't just stop staring at the monitor and even worse they could probably lost their sight and they will end up with blindness. That's why you have to be away from the screen but, being too long on your computer is bad. This is my @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad because the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers. The @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers because when people are on their computers too much time they just couldn't come down stairs talk with their family of friends, they could'nt go outside and enjoy the glory of nature and the enjoyment at the outside world, and also if they had nothing they can just read a book, draw, watch the @CAPS4, etc. They could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers. This is my @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers. The last reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to use their computer for a less time because when people use their computer for a less time it is good because now they finally could be with their family and friends and spend so much time with them. It also good to saving energy, and prevent you from paying alot of electrical bill, and also it is good to finally let your vision of the eyes to relax. In conclusion, the three reasons; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer. @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computer, and @CAPS3, people need to use their computers for a less time will prove that the effects of the computer I think its very bad.

Dear editor, I think people are using computers to much and are not benifiting as much as loosing from it people are getting less exercise, not seeing nature, and not spending no much quality time with their family and friends. Read on to find ou more. First of all, people are not getting enough exersize. Especialy children, They spend to much time on computers and are becomeing over weight. America is in a crisis with child obesety. So computer have chipped into that. Many adults are over weight because they sit at computers and work as play games all day. I reason that computers are more unhealthy for us. Secondly, people are not going on hikes or trips to see the beauties of nature. Earth has many things to offer, new things to explore and discover. People can be discovering many great wonders. Finding new species, is something you need to explore nature for: animals, fish, plants, there are many out there waiting to be discovered. Reason @NUM1 why computers are not benifiting us. Thirdly, family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should. Realitives you talk to over computers, why not talk to them in real life. friends chatting online on facebook, aim, things like that, why not talk to each other in person and have fun memories with each other? More kids are spending time on the computer than sitting down eating a family meal together and expreriensing what a family should talk about. Reason @NUM2 on why computers are not benifitting us. In conclusion, Computers are taking over our minds and were not getting much exersise. Seeing the beauty of nature, and spending less more with their families.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren't even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, "where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1" or "how much does something cost." Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment.

Computers, a @LOCATION1 topic if you ask me. Sure they arnt very good for you dosn't mean if you use it correctly then it can be a souce of life. Computers are helpful in many ways, they can be an information post. The social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world. During school kids have projects and without computers. Read on as I will explain in details. Computers, as you know, are one of the worlds greatest information posts. @NUM1 out of ten people survayed said that the computers are a value of everyday life, The earthquake in haiti is recovalng now, but half the world wouldnt know that with out computers so have a heart, and dont take away the most valued info in the world. Secondly, what would you say if I told, you that kids are more socialy retarded than ever! Well its true. Over @NUM2 of the worlds people rely on intractive websites to comunicate with each other. Fact, children have more friends over the internet then ever. You dont want to be the @LOCATION1 in all this do yours ar know as the person who kept kids from living? I dont think so. Lastly, all people in school use computers to do projects, for instance @PERSON2 had horrible hand writing and this was the bigest project of the year. So he turned his computer to type it, he gets on at. But what if there was (@CAPS1) computer! @PERSON2 would have gotten a @CAPS2 - for the project. In fact teachers @CAPS3 wear tell kids to type hw/projects. @PERSON1 says "@CAPS3 year kids pass my class by typing and if they then they would all flunk!" @CAPS4 got the point but more importantly do you?! To sumit all up for those of you lazy enough to not read there story essay. Computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information. Makeing friends, or doing projects. So are you gonna be the person who sits back and lets that happen or are you going to get up and stop the maddness once and for all. Its you choice but think of the socity retarded, dumb kids that fail the grade @CAPS3 year.

Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer? In this modern world, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 seem hard for you to tear away from that trusty computer screen and face life. Nearly everyone in @LOCATION1 has a computer, about @PERCENT1, and @CAPS2 is ruining our country. With all these hours wasted in the virtual world, people are lacking in exercise, leading to many problems. They are also avoiding nature outside, and losing contact with family and friends. I think that computers are causing way too many problems and peerhaps, with some consideration @ORGANIZATION1 my evidence, you could come to think the same. Statistically, the @ORGANIZATION1 is the most overweight country. One @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons? Hours @ORGANIZATION1 sitting at the computer replaces healthy exercise @CAPS3 are all spending our lives on the computer, and sitting and clicking is not exercise. The great lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise is causing health problems. Not exercising can lead to abesity, which damages joints terribly. Then, diabetes developes, taking away from the quality @ORGANIZATION1 your life. Finally, there is heart disease, a top killer in our country. All this from spending time on the computer? you @MONTH1 ask @CAPS4 the amount @ORGANIZATION1 time @CAPS3 spend on computers is much more damaging than this. Every day is beautiful in its own way, and sometimes @CAPS2 is beautiful to us, in saying that beautiful to us (when @CAPS2 comes to the outdoors) is clear skys and a warm-temperature. These days come quite often, but what does @ORGANIZATION1 do? Glance out the window and go back to texting on that @ORGANIZATION2 laptop. Our bodies need this @CAPS5, @CAPS5 @CAPS6. @CAPS3 get @CAPS2 from the sun, and without going outside, @CAPS3 don't get @CAPS2. not traveling outdoors deprives our body @ORGANIZATION1 an important @CAPS5. @CAPS2 affects more than just our health, as well @CAPS7 inside on the computer keeps us from having expenence real experience. @CAPS3 learn things on the computer, but only virtually. What happens when @CAPS3 are forced out into the real world and cant really do anything? Everyone loves having friends and family, so @CAPS2 doesn't make sense why @CAPS3 would rather email them with trivial things instead @ORGANIZATION1 talking. Instant messaging doesn't really bond people, as conversations are planned out you have time to think, so the person doesn't know what the real you would say. This frays the bonds between people, and once @CAPS3 can't work together, even with family, @ORGANIZATION1 can't work together at all, and nobody wants that. Computers take away too much to be spending so much time on. Blatantly, they are bad for people. Not only do they effectively cause abesity, they fool us into thinking @CAPS3 can do things that really, @CAPS3 can only do virtually, and make close people come apart. @CAPS2's ruining @LOCATION1. A country cannot be by the sick, useless, and isolated. @CAPS2's time to step away from the computer and into real life before @LOCATION1 gets demolished by these effects computers cause.

Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like "see you at @NUM1", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. 
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers. This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are making a great impact! Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. This is useful in daly life all the time! Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented at things requiring their hands (like baseball or basket ball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too. Something as simple as driving a car doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in hand-eye coordination computers bring. This is a fantastic effect that computers have on people. In addition to the hand-eye coordination computers teach, they also help you learn about faraway places and people. This splendid information is easier to aquire thanks to the technowlogy of computers. "@CAPS2 I didn't use my laptop for my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report," says @PERSON1, and @NUM1 grade student, " I would never finish. Books take so long and I learned so much about my topic from my computer!" @CAPS2 you are going on vacation, You can easily research your destination's location and culture with this advanced search engine. Why wouldn't you use a computer when you learn so much from them? Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other. They have lots of ways to video chat, @CAPS6 message, and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with. "I had to move away from my best friend last @DATE1," says @PERSON3, resident of @LOCATION1, "With my computer we can still talk to each other and stay friends." computers are definatly a great way to communicate with friends and family. Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people; and even allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing! Ask yourself this, how would computers have a positive effect in your life?

Dear newspaper, In my opinion computers do benefit society because a computer is like a big electronics dictionary and they help our soldiers stay out of the line of fire. Computers benefit our society because they are like an electronic encyclopedia. Instead of leasing through a dictionary page by page trying to find a word, all that you would have to do is go on the internet type in @LOCATION1 and in the search box type in the word and every thing pops up. When i have to write a paper on someone I usually use the internet. The other day I had to write a paper on @PERSON1, so I went on the internet, found a website, took notes, put them into my own words and made a works called page. I thought that was easier then finding time to you do a and then find out there  only childrens books on that person. And you can also look up places like @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, or if you need to find out where a place is use @ORGANIZATION1. Computers also benefit our society because they are like big cellphones with a huge keyboard. My big sister is always on the computer using @CAPS2 talking to her friends. This helped her learn to type. Also there are new things like @CAPS3 where you can play games with your friend and talk to them while youre playing. Lastly computers benefit our society because they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. When I watch futureweapons I see unnamed helicopters that can be controled from hundreds of miles away. Also there is a robot used that digs out mines which saves many lives. When I interviewed @CAPS4 @CAPS5 from the military he said, "@CAPS6 use those helicopters all the time. @CAPS6 also love how noone has to be in the helicopters so @CAPS6 don't have to worry." In conclusion computers benefit our society because they are like big electronic encyclopedias, they also are like big cellphones with huge keyboards, and lastly they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. In school @CAPS6 use computers all of the time for writing papers and researching different things.

Technology, such as computers are very big. I belive computers have a good effect on people. People that use computers mostly use it to connet with family do research, or to be neat and not write it on paper. I belive that people who don’t think computer make a good effect on people shouldn't bother wasting their time using one. @PERCENT1 of people only use computer to connect with family. Usually your family either lives far away or in another state and you dont get to see them very often. Thats why I think video chating on the computer is a good thing. Also is a family come up you could @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 your family members instead of calling them because they would talk to you forever. Lastley if you use myspace, facebook or twitter you could connect with old friends and not just family members. "@CAPS2 my teachers enjoy it when I use the computer to do my work, they said its alot neater" said @CAPS3 romano from strong middle school. Teachers perfer it when you use the computers to do your work. When you are writing a book report or you are writing a story, you would want to use,icrosoft word of something to write out your paper so it is easer for teachers to read. Also if your in science class and you need to make the chart you would want to use exal to make the chart or graph look more professional. Lastly is you wanted to do a presintation on bloody @DATE1 or little @CAPS4 nine you would want to use a power point instaed of just reading from note cards. If people didn't have google or yahoo they wouldn't know what to do, computers are very good for research. If a student to do a presentation on something they would want to know more about it and look,the topic up. Also if your family was having a discusion at dinner and you had no idea what they were talking about you would look it up online, lastly if you just wanted to find lyrics to a song because you and a friend disagreed on something. Once again I belive that computers make a good effect on people, good for connecting with friends and family. Good for being neat and lastly good for reaserching anything!

Dear Newspaper, Computers have advance a lot since they were first made. Some people see computers as a way to rot your brain, while others see it has a learning device. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to each other online. To start off, computers are bad because they can be used as a way to babysit a child. When you're on the computer you're just sitting there staring at a screen with pictures and words on it. Some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite, instead of taking the time to go outside. By growing up in an enviornment like that the children only know how to play on the computer. Kids have a lot of energy, and they need to do something productive, not play computer games and talk to their friends. All school day they talked to their friends, they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy. By using the computer as a babysitter, you as a parent are leading your child to obisity because all they do is games, and they aren't properly taking care of their body. On the other hand, computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. If your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on @LOCATION2 that was do in a week, what would you do? You can't fly to @LOCATION2 and ask the @CAPS1 people what you want to know. That would be a waste of time and money. And if you go the library and they don't have any books, then you're in trouble. But by using the computer you can find endless information about @LOCATION2, and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to. Also, if you were going to @LOCATION4, but you knew nothing about @LOCATION4 you wouldn't be very confident about going. And you would feel like a tourist. But, if you went online and searched @LOCATION4, you could find the traditions, the clothing, and so much more. Lastly, if you wanted to know more about a famous person who isn't around anymore, you could go on the computer and find pictures and what they did, how they became famous, and so on. Finally, computers allow people to talk online with other people. Say your grandma lives in @LOCATION3, and you can't call to often because your phone bill will get to high, what do you do then? You talk online since you both have computers and it won't cost you to call. For example, my grandma and grandpa both live in @LOCATION1. When we call there it costs a lot because they're so far away. When they got a computer, we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on @ORGANIZATION1. Now, not only did we talk to them, but we also get to see them too. If your friend didn't have a phone and you really needed to ask them for the homework, you could go online or on aim or facebook and ask them. You know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away people an places, and they allow you to talk online with other people.

Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a lot of effect on people @CAPS1 their not getting the exercis they need coz there just exercising there fingers. And while there at the computer there not looking at nothing else but the screen and thats not good for anyones health if there just looking at a computer screen the hole time. Another reason why i think at affects people @CAPS1 there not eatin wat they need to eat there just eatin something quick like junck food so they could on the computer. All are this effect stay on the @CAPS1 people either go places or have atheres might not be going out time their effects need to

Dear @LOCATION1, *@CAPS1*. Now I hear my favorite @CAPS2 tunes. A few clicks here and type in a word and I am watching a funny episode of "@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 #@NUM1". I go to my @CAPS5 page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are only some things I can do on my computer. As you can see I need my computer for many things. I am all for using computers and I think they are a useful resorce. But @CAPS6't stop now, I have many more reasons for using computors. Thier not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, @CAPS6't Use @CAPS7 @CAPS8!! I can't stress @CAPS7 enough to say that if you need to talk to a friend far away @CAPS6't drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long-distance calls. Go to @CAPS5, facebook, twitter, or something that will save you gas and money. Some people want to talk to thier friends in @LOCATION2 but they @CAPS6't have any of these computer sites. Pursuade them too!! Another issue some face is, "You need to get out and excersize." I have only one answer. Most people @CAPS6't know the right ways to excersize. Then, they end @CAPS8 hurting themselves. If they just went online and found out that they could do a painless, priceless, fun work out that is very effective then they would not get in so much physical and finantial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to @CAPS10 more out in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn't know what you could or could not eat? LIke I @CAPS9 say, "@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11" remember @ORGANIZATION1. FInally, if your doing a report or something formal, you want @CAPS7 to look nice, right? Well, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people in the @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting and 9/@NUM3 teachers mistake words that are messily hand-writen. This shows that if you use a computor @CAPS7 will not only show the word you wrote but also correct @CAPS7 with spell check. In conclusion, there are many benefits to using a computor. Lets recap, computors can save money, time, and gas. Computars can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility. Act now!!! Show others that there are benifits to using computers, show them all the wonders of this amazing machine, That is not only a time waster but a life saver.

Dear Newspaper I think that computers were one @ORGANIZATION1 the best things ever created. They allow you to talk to people in far away places, help you learn about career and education choises, and you are able to learn about many subjects. Computers are here to help society not hurt it so why shouldn'y we use them? With @CAPS5 we can talk to people around the world or in space @CAPS2 that matter. You might not know it hut all @ORGANIZATION1 the communications in the world need a @CAPS5. There not the kind anyone could go out and but though. There satalites, the orbit the planet from space, @PERSON1, a proffesor at @ORGANIZATION1, told students at @ORGANIZATION3 that, "A lot @ORGANIZATION1 every day items, such as rars and phones, all use some kind @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5." @CAPS1 computers let people communicate with each other. In addition to letting people communicate they help millions @ORGANIZATION1 people make educational and career choises. Most kids that go to college don't know a lot @ORGANIZATION1 colleges out there. When my sister was picking what college she wanted to go to she didn't know which one to choose. She sat down and looked up hundred @ORGANIZATION1 schools. after narrowing it down she had made her decision she had picked @ORGANIZATION4, a @ORGANIZATION3 she had never even heard @ORGANIZATION1 a couple months ago. People are in this type @ORGANIZATION1 situation all the time at @ORGANIZATION2 a survey was taken by all the students to see what they wanted their career to be, @CAPS2 the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the week students got to experience diffrent carrer options. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the students picked a different carrer after that one week. Have you ever heard the old aget "@CAPS3 is power"? well its true and computers are a great source @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3. they have many different subjects math, science, history language and much much more. people should be using this @CAPS3 at the @CAPS4 francisco national debate @PERSON2. Said that "@CAPS5 are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places math. and even comunicating these are what computers should be used @CAPS2 not unhealthy games. You can learn about many new places with a @CAPS5. In @NUM1 grade my teacher had everyone do areport on a country me and my friend found this place we had both never heard @ORGANIZATION1. with the @CAPS5 we found onts @ORGANIZATION1 information on it such us its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts surely one would agree that a @CAPS5 is a great tool that should be used. It lots people communicate, helps in educational decisions, and you can learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a @CAPS5.

Mom!!! Did you know that the human body has only one liver!!!, @CAPS1 I didn't where did you find out, on the computer. I recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, and enjoying nature. I dont think that they should be concerned because the computer leave's people with an open mind and teach people new thing. So the computer does a lot for people, give's them the chance to learn new thing, a chance to chat with friends far away, and also expand your mind of travel. Computers can do a lot for a person's life of know'lleage. Just yesterday I found out that the human body can not survive without its liver. The computer also helped me with my strugle's in math, even though that's what the teacher is for she is not always their, like when I am home or away on vacation and I just want to remember so thing's in math. Its also help's people who want to know new launage's such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. So you see a computer has a big affect on a person's life. Two days ago I did a video chat with my grandparents back in @LOCATION2 it was great. After six year's not seeing my grandparents they really changed, and I was starting to forget what they looked like. I never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away I was surprised. I dont know why you experts are so concerned about computer taking away people's live's look what it has done for my family. I know that if one of you experts family member went away for a long time you would miss them and want to talk. Some people's love to video chat like people in the army because they get the chance to see their love one's. A two-way ticket to @LOCATION3, To see all those beautiful sight's and taste their wonderful food's look at that waterfall where is that, In @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 now I have to go their. The computer has shone me places that I have neve sene before. The computer is a wonderful thing. So dont be concerned about us and what we do on the computer. In conclusion dont listen to the experts they dont know what their talking about, for all we know they use the computer more than we do. The compute can touch you new thing, give you the chance to chat with family and friends far away, and open your mind on travel. The computer is not a bad thing all it's doing is making life a little better step by step.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers are a good source of technology. The reasons which I am fighting for tell why, kids are in school more than half of the school day. Parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. To begin, kids are in school more than have of a school day. How could children stay on the computer when there in school learning? They can't. In school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around. After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. Computers don't have effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away. Parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online. Lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. If you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. Also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too! Another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports. We need our information! To conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider because, mny other people would be shy to wirte this and get it published in their local newpaper! I would like to say computers are not interacting with family, friends, nature or anything of that sort. We as a whole need computers to do daily life things, without be able to go online, or save files we would be lost! So I will say again to consider my ideas. Thank you.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 several reasons on way I that advances in technology are harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers on the outside world. Its also takes you away from family and friends. Lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet. One of my severl reasons on way I feel advanced technology is harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers @CAPS2 teens, adult's and etc. The probem with this is that you never really know whos on the other side of that door, that chat room people can miss guide you into thinking there someone who there not. @CAPS2 example theres a show called dateline. This show is about how young teens put there selev's online and grown or young men click on a picture of you and that opens up a chat line or as I say opening a door, you dont know who's on the other side of that door. So these men online makes these teens trust them and make them feel safe if they are a friend you "hey can I come over sometime?" you this young teen thinking thats your friend says yea sure. Dont forget you dont see his picture so he come's over and most of three men are looking @CAPS2 a quick fix. If you know what I mean. This is what go's on during dateline t.v show just imarge how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing the difference is they dont get caught. Secondly on why is harmful to our socitey is because it takes you away from your family and friends. It takes you away from your kid's family because that will start to fill as if you love that computer more then them. It take you away friends because they might say hey let's go out to the mall or @CAPS2 a drink youll probably say check up on somethings online. This will one move slowly away from you, all over a computer you will start to lose the people most important to you. My last reason on why you can harm society with teconogly is because it takes you away from living your own life and doing thing's you wanna do like online is a bunch of stuff that everybody else say's is cool. Do what you think and feel is cool. @CAPS2 example if someone posted something saying @NUM1 guys lodon is so cool you gotta go there but youve always wanted to go to @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 thing is that you do get to have enough air outside like your skin will get pail and icky and this is why I feel that way. In covlsion all though some people might think that advanced tencogly is good well cleary there not because they open doors to danger, take you away from friends and family. Also it takes you away from what life has to offer.

Do a adults and kids spend to much time on the computer? Well I don’t think they do. Sure they use it a lot but still it's for enter to inment. Kids need to use the computer because it's another way for them to communicate with each other. Textings good but it costs money, so does to lking on the phone. If a doesn't have texting they can go on facebook or something to make make plans to do something with a friend. What if it's a rainy day outside and there's nothing to do? Well that's what a computer for.Kids use the computer for entertainment. There's tons of games to play. All on different websites of course but that's beside the point. There's mmorpg or rpg those are two type of games I can think of computers are like kids own virtual outside world. Computers are also needed to do research for school projects. Also to get pictures. Sure there book but they don't always have everything you're looking for. You can't cut pictures out of books. You need a good grade on a project. Therefore computers need to be used a lot. for communication, entertainment, and school projects.
<START>

My opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.

Dear readers, I think that its good and bad to use the computer to much
<START>

Dear - Local Newspaper I agree thats computers are good for society. Without computers a lot of things couldn’t be done. Computers are sometimes the easy way out. And thats why I love them. Computers almost makes anything possible. Now say if your an elderly person and you cant get up and your bodys really bad. Well all you need is a computer. You can pay your bills online or you can get a job online or even shop online. All you need is a computer. Computers are also good if your lazy. You can just lay in bed all day and go online to work or to the mall and order things all youll have to care about is personal hygenic. Sometimes computers take a lot of stress of you. No more ignorant co-workers or no angry boss everythings a-okay. Computers are also swel because its the eazy way out. But you have to make sure you get a good computer. Not and old one because it can breakdown. Dats one reason why computers arent so good. But as i said computers are very good they might be a little pesky but ones you get the hand of them everything gonna be alright and remember you can do almost anything with a computer.

Certain materials being removed from libraries such as books, music and magazines, shouldn't be removed from the libraries. It gives people a chance to understand how the real world @CAPS2.     Having certain materials such as books and music definitly should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book @CAPS2 or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song @CAPS2 saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band @PERSON1 A.M. @CAPS2, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really the band @CAPS2 talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost there legs, and telling how beautiful each and everyone of them really are. His book taught me a few things and made me think different about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person @CAPS2 beautiful.     As far as movies and magazines has gone within the last few years, I think that the also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think @CAPS1 for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course we see previews of movies and think that they @MONTH1 not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out. Movies @CAPS2 a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarassed or maybe even get @CAPS4. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possible save your life or perhaps maybe even someone elses life.     I don't understand why some libraries would want to banned certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone elses life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did.

Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves? People have different oppions, of whats good and whats bad. I have read and seen a lot of books in my life time. I hear people telling me, 'oh dont read that book its a bad book.'But I ask myself, @CAPS2 do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance?'      @CAPS1 are some books, music, movies, and magazines out @CAPS1 that are offensive. Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books, from the libraries we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think its offensive?     Ask yourself the question again, '@CAPS2 do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance?' @CAPS3't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own oppion is
<START>

In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive.  Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not.  Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life.  This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.     Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries.  They find these things to be offensive.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended.  The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive.  The library is a place for study.  It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world.  It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.     I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive.  Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research.  There are certain sections in the library.  If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section.  I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section.  The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not.  If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.     Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need.  One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it.  If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it.  The library can be compared to a big computer.  One can basically find anything there.  Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs.  It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.     Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life.  If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left.  People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone.  There does not need to be any censorship in libraries.  It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find.

In life you have the 'offensive things'. The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us.  No it is not easy to get over ,but these things will make you stronger. Sometimes there are books, magazines, music and movies  that offened us. The only reason why we get offensive is because the subject either reflects our personality, or our life. It's not the authors fault, they write what they feel and what is the truth.          Okay, so libraris are full of book's, movies, music, etc. You can't just take books off the shelves, just because they offened you. Other people @MONTH1 like the book you hate. There are more books in the library you can read.           Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library; it will hurt whoevers' company got the book published and also the writters. Writters and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells' there books,magazines, movies. They make thousands of copies of thier product, which takes money. So to make thier money back ,they sell to thousands of book stores.           Must of the offensive material will open the worlds eye's. Everybody needs to see whats going on in the world. Books, newspapers tell the truth about a subject. Now the writters intent is'nt to hurt you but to help you. Why cant the world be more open?          I know in my own life i have read books that at first ,the book offended me. I would get so mad, i would put the book down and walk away. But then,my eyes would open and finaly it hit me.  The offensive part out of the book helped myself relives a new understanding. The views i used to have would be gone. It is strange how you finnaly open up, and your life changes.     Some people might even find this paper offensive. But if nobody is stepping on your toes, and getting under your skin you wont ever change. Offened is a word used lightly; yes, people use it a lot but do they really mean it. Some people need to use 'well this book bugs me'. Stop being about yourselves and get over it. Life is to short to worry and feel offended.      Every single book, magazine,movie and music needs to be left alone. Those materials @MONTH1 reflect other peoples life and help others with thiers'. Just read another book, or watch a different move. Please do not remove anything from the selves, because it will only do more damage

A lot of @CAPS3 today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and Magazines. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and my views on the censorship of @CAPS3. Here's my idea to fix the problem.      I understand that books and other material @MONTH1 offend certain people, but it might not offend others. Thats why I think @CAPS3 should have a room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be seperate rooms for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content.      This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain @CAPS1 to enter the 'bad content' room. I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 could be @NUM1 years of @CAPS1 to enter the room. That seems fair enough. Your old enough to be able to handle the content.      I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not.      Seperate rooms, @CAPS1 limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very affective. I hope to start seeing that in the future

How @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library? I, along with many other students, @CAPS4 find this discouraging and distastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population @MONTH1 be born.     Like the beloved @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I @CAPS4 not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now. All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like @PERSON2 did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity @CAPS4 not only affect this generation, but the futures of all.          If this censorhip was to be allowed, who is to say what all  could be censored? Who @CAPS4 be the final judge as to what books @CAPS4 be banned? It @CAPS4 all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. This struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties. Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe @CAPS4  be wrong. For instance, it @CAPS4 be like an @CAPS1 forcing a @CAPS2 to not believe in @CAPS3; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship @CAPS4 lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing.     Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books @CAPS4 be to censor all individual mentality. Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world @CAPS4 become similiarly vapid and dull. Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality @CAPS4 decrease.     To conclude, censorship @CAPS4 be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. So how @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? Disrespected? That is how I @CAPS4 feel

Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.      So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. We I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated.     The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will  always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go.      I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years.     So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer.     Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood.     The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to.     Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.      So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay
<START>

The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.      The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.      However, some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.     Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it
<START>

All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience.  No author writes something and says, 'I hope no one picks this off of the shelf!' So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard. We all have the freedom of speech, right? So, why not the freedom of writing? Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive.     Everyone will read a book that they don't like, its natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it. Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience; so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive. Not everyone believes in the same ideas. You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way. Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life. She has gotten into some really horrible situations. Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it. But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations. Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book; suddenly she finds guidence in it. She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before. She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her. So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidence?      Situations happen like this all of the time. People find something special in what they read that other people might not find. When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone. No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas. We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. No one should have the right to take that away

Have you seen a magazine, book, movies, etc., that are found affensive? What experiences did you have? Here is my opinion on if I think that those books should be removed or not.       I have noticed that some movies are affensive to other people. Like for an example, the @CAPS1 movies, books is about @CAPS2 and some people don't believe in them or they don't like the movie so I do kind of see no point of making a movie that is about someone that is not real. However, some movies are okay for some people and their age. The movies that are rated '@CAPS3' are for the people who shouldn't be watching it yet like kids under the age.      Magazines though do have some type of thing that I think that is affensive to other people. Like, I don't remember the name of them but they would have sections that would talk bad about another person like one of the kids would talk about the president or something like that. So I think some magazines should be removed off the shelves.      The books however, I don't see a reason why to have them removed off the shelves. I don't think the books seem to be affensive as much as graphical. There could be some books out there that might be affensive to people though, like the ones that talk about a family that has no money or talk bad about them. For an example, you would be able to find a book and read it and find out that it is talking bout things that you don't want to know yet or want to know.      So as you can see I have made an opinion on what they should do either keep the books, magazines, or movies off the shelf. But then I do see it the other way to. Some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting
<START>

Personally I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned. If they are found offensive to the public. I think it offends lots of people. Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inaproppriate material. I think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eight-teen years of age. The economy is bad enough the way it is. There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they should't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines.      I think music is what influences a person the most. If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a persons mind. I know this from experience. I also believe that movies influence a peron lot too. For example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it. Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' That is just one example of how the humans mind can change.     In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though. Also, I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library. So that  just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending

A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax.  Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there.  Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship.  Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.       First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted.  If they offend you then do not read them.  It is as simple as that.  Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs.  A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series.  @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs.  Therefore those people boycott the series.     I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released.  While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing.  Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party.  They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong.  I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book!       Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content.  For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person.  Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards.     Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true.  If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library.  Although there could be a way to compromise.  If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides.       In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children.  When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read.  While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read.  Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes.  Books are a gateway to another world.  Why take that magic away from children

Yes and no, some materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be voted upon the citizens to be removed from shelves.          I do think that some materials in those catagories should be removed if they are offensive to me as well as others, but it will take a long while to get them removed from stores and other places if other people like them. I do not like how they make some music to be very violent and cause minds of most teenagers to turn bad and start selling drugs on the street of their hometown, but i can't do anything about that because that kind of music is admired by those teenagers as well as some adults too. If some people can buckle down and see that stuff like that will mess up lives of teenagers and some adults who fall victim to it, then there is a chance that it can be stopped. Stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances.     Here's another example, like this music artist named @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She has made some great songs for the past year and a half now. People have told me that she is part of a group called @CAPS3 and its a group where they try to I think 're-birth' thereselves. My friends wanted me to stop listening to her music. I told my friends that I do not like the fact that she joined this group, but that doesnt mean im gonna stop listen to her music. Now if she makes a song that is offensive to me and as well as my friends, then that where I draw the line.     What im saying is that if people don't have others to back them up if something is highly offensive to them and oblivious to others, it will be very hard trying to prove yourself in the best way possible.
<START>

When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves, because their the ones thats going to the library anyway.                 I believe that everybody is intitle to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed.  For example, some music could be offensive; therefore, I'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries. I'm saying the offensive music should be removed
<START>

Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are, and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read? I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves.     Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays. If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it.     Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man. Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action. Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face. Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her. Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living. Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting. @CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life.     Just think all that I have told you about, gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people. these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves.

A lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them. Some people think that kind of thing is funny, but to others it @MONTH1 bother them. Not only racial slurs can offend people, but profanity can make someone disappointed. Some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that. And I believe if it is offensive it should be taken off the shelf in a library and you should too.     The movies and music I think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it. They just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie. You can't not make something that is making fun of another race or a movie of killing them.          Going to like school libraries, for books I think it really depends on the age group. Like their should not be anything that would be offensive or profanity in the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS4. They are just not old enough or mature to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines. So if a student comes home with a book the class is reading and the parent doesn't like the content they should have the right to say that they don't want their child reading it. And if was really bad be able to take it out of the school.     Even @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that have more mature students get offended sometimes from the books their reading in school. One in example is 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6'. Even though it is a really good book and a lot of @CAPS4 read it. A lot of @CAPS7 @CAPS8 might get offended by all the racial slurs about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. They just do not feel comfortable fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them. And the @CAPS4 or libraries just should not make students read books that they don't feel comfortable reading. Or the libraries having books like that.     Me in example, next year I'm going to have to read that book and I am just not going to like it. I'm half @CAPS7 @CAPS12 and I do not like people saying things like that. It is going to be a really akward moment for me. And I have some other friends that have read that book that didn't feel comfortable reading that book.     Their are even little kid books that parents want out of their childs school library. The most challenged book in school libraries is @CAPS13 @CAPS14. I know this because my librarian told me this one day. It is just a good book, but some parents don't want their kids reading about witchcraft and wizards. So they try to get them out of the library. And they should if the parents do't want their kids reading it.     I just think if their is a certain amount of people complaining about a movie or song that their should not even be a fight about it. They should just get rid of it. Same thing in a school, if their is students or parents that are complaining and their is a certain amount of them, the librarian should not even have a say in it or the school. They should just get rid of the book or magazine.     I believe that if it a book, song, movie , etc is offensive to a certain amount of people that it should just be taken care of by getting rid of it. Parents might not want their kids seeing, hearing, or reading that sort of stuff. And some people get offended by some books or movies. Or they just do't feel comfortable. I believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it.

Do you think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines shout be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive? Such as magazines, books, movies, and even music. I simply do not find any of it right that few peoples opinion's should matter depending on what they find offensive for two reasons. Those reasons being that you picked it out yourself and that you have traveled to the library looking for something you will enjoy.     The first reason I think that certain books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed form the shelves are because people have picked them out there selves. Noone is ever going to pick up a book or magazine or even watch movies and listen to music that looks, seems, or even sounds offensive. Mainly because alot of people don't take being ofeneded to kindly. For example, why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing to them?     The second reason that I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves are because if your going to the library your looking for an interesting book, type of music, a movie, or a magazine. Most likely you're going to end up getting one that looks intersting to you and something that you feel fits your taste. So if there is a book, some sort of music, a movie, or a magazine and it looks offensive then don't get it because if somethings going to offend you its going to be pretty obvious due to what it looks like, seems like, or even sounds like.     In my opinion I think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to some people that they should not be taken off the shelf. If you picked something out at the library or went to the library looking for something that you would enjoy, you will obviously end up knowing if something looks, seems, or even sounds offensive

If the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines then yes, they can feel offensive about the @CAPS7 things inside the magazine or books. These people are going to always find something or some rumor to start a big fight about these @CAPS1 things, those people are called '@CAPS2'. They can find A eazy way to get something started just like that, That's why before i buy A magazine, I take A look inside of first And see If @CAPS3 interested in buying that specific certain book, or magazine. If I don't like the things that I see inside of @CAPS5, then I @CAPS4 not buy @CAPS5, @CAPS5's @CAPS1 As that. If they are @CAPS7, they should immediately be removed from the news stands on the streets of @LOCATION1, @LOCATION6, @LOCATION12, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, @LOCATION8, @LOCATION9, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION10, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, Or @CAPS8 @LOCATION11, @LOCATION7.

I think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library. All the bad books, music, magazines and movies no one really wants to read. If a kid picks up the book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies that would be bad to read. If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies, music or magazines. If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from. There are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books.     There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read. There are things like books that talk about sex. There can also be language that the kids should not read. I know for sure, that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older.         There are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to. There is things like sex songs. There are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it. I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that, I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs.     There is also movies that I don't want my kids to watch, because of the content of the movie. There are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all have something to do with sex. Latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate.      Their is one more thing that I think is very important, which is magazines. There are many things that can happen in magazines like porn. I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn. I think in general we should get rid of porn, and descusting pictures in magazines.

Dear news people,     I am qriting to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it's a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.     I don't think it's fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fare and it's a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb.     So to rap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waist time and cause a problem that's my oppion about this problem hope it is yours to.
<START>

I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 them. Some @CAPS1 feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having. @CAPS1 often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those @CAPS1 can get the books and @CAPS2 them to help them solve there problems.     If the books etc are offensive then, the @CAPS1 who think they are shouldn't get them. The can't control what books are in the library. Some @CAPS1 have problems and some of the books can help them. Alot of @CAPS1 I know dont think that alot of books are offensive. Its eather they want to @CAPS2 them or they dont.      If @CAPS1 think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it. @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 all kinds of books and some dont even like to @CAPS2. For the @CAPS1 who like to @CAPS2 they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with. If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to @CAPS2.      I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. Im sure that they wont do anything about it. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For @CAPS1 To @CAPS2', and to understand what there life is and how to fix it.      You have to control under the books. You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf. In conclusion I think that @CAPS1 should deal with it because they cant control it
<START>

Hello, my name is @CAPS1, I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries.  If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media.  People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like they are able to put it back on the shelf.  People say The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1, that is completly speculated it's all a matter of 'he said she said.'  I feel there should be sections for different sections for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un-@CAPS5.     There should be a parent supervising children @NUM1 and younger, because where it really comes to are the children and them not being exposed to something there not ready for.  There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in librarys, and those are as follows: pornography, non-educational movies, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and social networks.     I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace but, shouldn't some leeway on books.  This is an approved message thank you for your time, goodbye.

Books Removed From Shelves?      'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the chelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that I work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no nooks left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement was from @PERSON1.  Do you think it is right for young children to look at immages that are not appropiate or read something that is talking baout sexual content?  I do not think any of these materials should be removed from the shelves, but they should be put in a privite area where only adults can get to them.       I think they should be put in a certain area, away from children, because children will get ideas from the material that they see and think it is okay to act like that.  There are some books and movies out there that teenagers and young children see that are about cereal killers and children think it is okay to bring guns to school and it is not okay.  Children are reading these books and thinking it is okay to act like their favorite character or acting like their favorite movie star in a movie.  Some of the movies that are out there are about doing stupid stuff, and children and teenagers think it is 'cool' because the person that they look up to is doing that, so they want to try it out also.  Children get hurt from doing @CAPS1.  Whenever a child sees people having sex, they think it is okay to do it too, becasue those kids in the movies are the same age as they are.   I think that movie producers shoudl be aware of what they put out there for children to watch.       When you talk about the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3, you think what a great book.  But would you ever think that it would be taken off of shelves because of one word that was used in it?  I think that it should stay on the shelves, but if a parent does not want their child to read it, then they do not have to read it.  If parents do not want their child to read something then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book.  I think the books should stay on the shelves and any material that has any 'bad' sontent on it should be put in a private section where only adults can get to it.       Do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content?  Children are getting bad ideas from books, movies, magazines, and music.  They think it is appropiate to act like @CAPS1, because their favotire movie star is preforming @CAPS1 way.  These books, movies, and magazines need to be put up out of children's reach, so they cannot get anymore bad ideas to do stupid stuff

I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way, So if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead. Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to @CAPS2. If a book does, don't read @CAPS2. Its as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. That could offend someone, and here are my reason why;          If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to. Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book, song, etc., offends a person.          I also think if you give a kid the chance to read @CAPS2, and he sees how offensive @CAPS2 might be, @CAPS2 might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book, Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, @CAPS1 every body is good people. Children read in a wide variety, some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading @PERSON1 '@CAPS2'. Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch. The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women, or man in @CAPS2. Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that.          My @CAPS4 reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them. What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life.           In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive. The offensive things Should @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also that @CAPS1 everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but its life. Finally I think people should @CAPS1 have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that @MONTH1 be interesting to them

The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values. With this on going problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our ablities, based off of our values

People are entitile to their own oppinion about things. What someone might find offensive someone else might not.           Libraries should be able to put anything that might interest a person who educate someone on there shelves wether people get offended or not. If we went by what everyone said we probably wouldnt have anything on the library shelves. People will find something wrong with everything a person can put out thats just human nature.              I have read nonfiction books and saw movies that are based on true storys that have used word and language that some people might find offensivc but how are people going to express their feelings and educate people without offending someone.                How are we suppose to teach history without telling the whole story. Slavery and the @PERSON1 were a horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again. It would be hard to teach about these horrible events without offending people.                     I believe that we should put these materials on out library shelves anyway, and if people do not like it then do not check them out or look at them. That's my opinion what's yours
<START>

I think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with. If books are found offensive and taken from shelves then book shelves would be emtpy. Then their would nothing left for people to read.     Some of the greatest authors use offensive words in their books take them off th shelves and you will be getting rid of the greatest material. @PERSON1 @CAPS1 for example in the book '@CAPS2' its offensive to gays and one gets killed.
<START>

A book is more than words or happenings; they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another. I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book, then someone from another country could read it. Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today.      There are many problems with entertainment today in my oppinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy; which @MONTH1 not be fit for some people.  I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake.       I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it. Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life.
<START>

I don't believe that certain books, music, magzines, or movies should be removed. If they are found offensive then that is not my problem. If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with. When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves.     No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. If a book id found offensive by one person or group of people that doesnt mean it should be removed off of the shelves. That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with.      Anything and everything is educational in it's own way. Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right. That being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves? It depends on a persons personal views or beliefs. Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that.     It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. It's just easier to live with it. Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. It depends on what you take offence to. Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. It's all based on how you take what they said into thought. So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves. For if one thing must be removed then youi might as well remove everything.
<START>

I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive.  If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.  Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in.     I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school.  The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.  Even teachers were reading it.  The school board did not even care though.  I think that was completely handled the wrong way.  They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it.  If it offended her, then she should not read it.     Music is an outlet for many people.  They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing.  Without music, there would not be any fun in the world.  People are alwasy listening to music.  When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc.  If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.     Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time.  That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian.  We want to good guys to win.  The movie makes fun of the bad guys.  Somebody is always going to get hurt.     When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else.  I think of how the artist feels.  Why they wrote it that certain way.  If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first.  Then if I like it, I start singing it.  If I do not like it, then I just change the song.     I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended.  We need the different opinions in life.  If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway.  I do not want to be the same as everybody else.  I love my personality.  I am different and kind of an outcast.  But I am true to myself.  And I respect other people's opinions.  I wish everyone would do the same.  Or at least try to do the same.  Thank you for listening to what I had to say
<START>

Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in.  There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual.  Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for.       Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in.  People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community.  I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it.  People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies.  Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in.  The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended.  There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something.     Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for.  People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal?  Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is.

Many people believe that magazines, books, movies, music, posters, plus some other kind of bad stuff that parents don't want there @CAPS1 to see. Some of the stuff they might have in the are books about different colored people, maybe there might also have some terrible things about that colored skin hairitage, @CAPS1 that are to young to be looking at stuff that is in these books. A lot of the @CAPS2 Libraries have these things speard around all over the store.     Some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color. If they don't like what the book and what it has to say then don't get that book. Because you can't change the way the author wrote the story, music, movie, poster. But most the people that I know that are different colored are pretty hilarious and sometimes make jokes about it.      Maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book

Would you want your childern reaing about things that only @CAPS1 know's what? When you go to a library you aspect to learn about @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1's @CAPS4,@CAPS5 etc. Libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in @CAPS9. When you first walk into a library you except to see people checking out @CAPS2 books , or books that catch your eye just by the title. If we find a book is offensive , or will not help better our childerns' future then stand up and fight for their own  mental development.     We must also think of what the childern want to read. They have the right to read what ever they want, as long as it's entertaining to them and they are learning something new. Some books teaches them about the world they are growing up in. There are some books that I would not let my own child read, but I know in my heart that she is learning something that I @MONTH1 not be able to teach her. Those types of books of are what I call, '@CAPS7's'. Those books that can come off seeming offensive, when in the end they are actually, what I call '@CAPS8', helping to prepare them for what is it come. Not every book will be full of rainbows, pretty colors, or pop-ups. They must know that they are some people they have to be mindfull of, and people who are educating them on @CAPS9. They have to learn the difference between what's right, and what's wrong.          Remember the first book you ever read by yourself? I do. It was called 'Of @CAPS10 and @CAPS11'. I read that book when I was @NUM1. Till this day my mother says, 'I tried to stop you from reading that book so many times , it had dangerous wording that an @NUM1 year should no be able to read at that young age'. What she did not know was that; that book had taught me alot about the world back then. That knowledge I had obtain then had helped me later on my @CAPS9.           Some books are ment to be read while some aren't. If you feel your child should not read a certain book then read it for yourself, and then tell your child the reason why they can not read the same book you had just read.

Libraries have alot of material to read about. They have childrens books to adult books. All of the books vary on different age groups. So many people go to the libary a day. But the question is, should certin materials be taken off the shelfts because they are found offensive? The answer is no.     When people go to the libary, that means they want to learn something, or find something to intertain them. When you go to the libary to reserch something, and they do not have the book you need, or the movie you need, what are you going to do? What happends when you are doing a project over something, and they do not have the book you need? Do you want your children failing in school because they libaries take materials off the shelfs?      People should not take materials off the shelfs beucase 'they do not like it.' If they think it is offensive, then they should put it back on the shelf and go find something else. They do not have to take it off the shelf because they are agenst it. Everyone has different beleafs on things.      Libaries have different sections to go find materials at. It varies from kids, fiction, and nonfiction. It also sometimes goes by what you are looking for. No one should take something off the shelf if it is offensive because it was their choose to look at it in the first place. No one can tell you what you can and cant look at when you go to a libary. If they do not like what they see, then put it down. It is that easy. If you can not find what you are looking for, then libaries also have computers to look up things
<START>

A book represents a person's beliefs and feelngs about a topic. Therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it @MONTH1 be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. If we do not accept other people beliefs, we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor.      Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. I think we have the right to know about important events. For one reason, if we forget about such things, than they are more likely to be repeated. Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? Just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator. Instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act.     While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people @MONTH1 find it offensive. There is a much easier solution that censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can.     The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the @CAPS3. Censoring that book would basically tell the @CAPS4 population that they are wrong.     Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not.
<START>

There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you. Some of these materials @MONTH1 be books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; @CAPS1 people like informational books. Everyone is different in their own way. The material they choose to read is their own choice.           How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or innapropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it their decision to say that some things offend people?                       Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someones music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. Theres a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it.      Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left? The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want. Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy
<START>

Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? @PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same.     Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now.     If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not.     People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truely enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated.  If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?
<START>

One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right no one would be able to express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves.      What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the secton that they belong. Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section. beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdrawl the book.     The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries

Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive.      The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it.     Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else.     Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves. Never

Dear Newspaper,      I beleive that no book should be taken off the selfs for nay reason. People @MONTH1 not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraires keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the self? I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyones going to wnat to read something different.        If libraries are going to take the material off the self that people don't like then the material that others like would be gone. For instance,if i were to take the '@CAPS1' series off the selves then all the '@CAPS1' fans would be ferious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There is alot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries arn't going to take them off the selfs.     Some parents arn't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, rasy book but thats what other adults enjoy reading. Those books arn't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want you're chilren to read them.     From experiance, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an imatture addiunce. But i'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the self. Some books are very vulger and nasty in the ways they discribe fights or wars or abuse but some people like readinf lititure like that so the libraries will keep them. If peoplehave problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them. Its as simple as that.      In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interest and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgur then they shouldn't ready that book, and if they dont want their childrena and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because thats not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them.                              Sincerly, @PERSON1

From many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries. The main reason is because of the books, magazines, ariticles, and internet that contains content very disturbing for children. Such content requires material as violence, drugs, and nudity. In this argument, parents do not like the fact that their kids have resources to uncensored content. Or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to.        Today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves. That is how children could get the idea in being a 'bad kid' in school. They think it is cool seeing someone else doing drugs, violence, or nudity. But if the libraries have censored content in the library, then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content. In the parents thoughts, uncensored content should be kept away from children.      The libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves. They either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library. They need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children. It is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material.           Their are parents who have kids in school, who do not care about what they learn or what they do. Parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning everyday. Then they can at least teach their childern about uncensored content.      Parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to. Children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child. The falt goes to the parents and the libraries. They should be aware of the material that the children are looking at

Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even @NUM1 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too.     Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else.     In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading.     Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.          All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc.     But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 thier children get away with everything.      One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world.     So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them. Please think about what I have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this

In this millenium we really should'nt be to concerned about censorhip. People say so way worse in puplic and do worse things in public. On the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf. Its the parents fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it. So why should we have censorship?                                                                             If a cd contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then its the parents fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. Same goes for books and etc.. Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it. If its about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. The parent should be the one to take responsibility.                           Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and ect.contain raceism in it then it should be censored, unless its about history. Kids under the age of teen usally repeat what they hear or read. Same goes for teenagers too actualy! Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be a age to where you can get it. The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear.                  I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than @NUM1 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. The parent was no where to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that? This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes. This was no ones fault, wasnt the library, wasnt mine. People should take responsibility, control their kids and if they can't then leave them at home!                                                        There are also certain people who need book for research and need to take home books for their projects. We should'nt have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids. Some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects!      No we should'nt have censorship in our libraries! Im not about to be able to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and ect., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and they could be a age lemit or a pass people could use. That would take to long to do so though. So keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them!

Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books @MONTH1 be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.     First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, @NUM1 year old boy, growing up in an all white town. Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child.      Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about.     Libraries are open to people of all age. It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area

Book @CAPS1     @CAPS2 I think about removing certain materials such as books, music, movies, and-or magazines is that it should be your choice. I always thought that was part of our constitutional right.     I read alot of urban books because that's @CAPS2 I enjoy. They realae towhere I have been, or where I @MONTH1 be going in my life. No they are not the kinds of books I would read to my grand childern, but they @MONTH1 choose later in life that they also enjoy urban books and movies.      You @MONTH1 not enjoy reading the materials that I enjoy either but that doesn't mean you should banned them. There are alot of books, and movies that I don't care for but I wouldn't ask for them to be banned. If everyone started @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they don't like, there wouldn't be any need for movies,  libraries, or book stores. Kids wouldn't have a future because they wouldn't know where they came from. @CAPS2's bad to you @MONTH1 not be bad to me, or the next person.     When you go into a library, or book store, you already have and idea of @CAPS2 you are looking for. If there are books that are not appropreiate for kids, they should have their own section that reads, 'For @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. We are the @CAPS3 and parents. We should be the one's in control of our kids and @CAPS2 they read and watch. I don't think @CAPS1 the materials would make the problem go away because kids these days, if they want them bad enough, will figure out away to read or watch them anyway.                                                 Ann                                        @CAPS5 and @CAPS6

Libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction.  No matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time. Libraries should not be censored.     Taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inapropriate for young readers is wrong.  I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life?  At least once in our exsistance on earth we find ourselves curious about something at we try it, just to see what it is like.  It is all a learning experience.      History would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are asshamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in @LOCATION1, the @CAPS1, and now the wars in the middle east.  Some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know @CAPS6, why and what happened.  Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not distroy it.      Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under @NUM1.  If anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the @CAPS4 and leave our libraries alone. Most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years.      I truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker.  All that is doing is giving readers less material to read.  In @LOCATION2, elementary educators are not required to teach their students @CAPS6 to spell, at all. I walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell @CAPS2 '@CAPS3' thinking that was the correct why to spell @CAPS2.  The @ORGANIZATION1's excuse for not having teachers teach @CAPS6 to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday.  Well guess what @LOCATION2, with the @CAPS4, gaming systems and iPods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know @CAPS6 to read and this is what it is going to be like.      '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 do you spell encyclopedia?'     '@CAPS6 should i know, I wasn't taught @CAPS6 to spell in @LOCATION2.'     You see what I mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books becuase they are the only things teaching our @ORGANIZATION1's future on @CAPS6 to spell simple words.        Today we have the @CAPS4, gaming systems, iPods and @CAPS8 to intertain us on a daily basis.  No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television.  And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not incouraging us to read.  You are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book.  To be truthfull I will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle.  I do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring.  When i read books like that they make me feel better about my life and @CAPS6 I interact with others.  I have learned @CAPS6 to deal with all of those things from books.  Most of my knowledge comes from those types of books and I would hate for my children to not be able to read the same materials as I did at their age and learn from those books

I belive certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information. I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies etc. from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?. Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a @NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom. In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries.

Have you ever been offended? Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality.     You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?     If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book.     The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed?

The libraries can contain book that are offensive to humans and animals. The book the are very offensive can contain megative coments just to entertain the readers.      I believe that all book, music, magazines, and etc should be removed from the shelves if they are found to contain offensive and negative thing about any human. For example, in political cartoon inside of newspapers, @PERSON1 is sometimes compared with a @CAPS1. We as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a @CAPS1. I take that very offensive because, back during the time when black were not able to do certain thing, the whites would refer to blacks as monkeys.      I being offened is not a good thing, and they last place they need offensive stuff is in the libraries. Libraries are suppose to hold positive material on the shevles. Book that give knowledge to people in need, not thing contain negative depictions of human life. Also children should be able to pick up a book, and not feel offened by it.      One night my little brother came home with a book that he got for the library. It was about a white dog and a dark colored dog together trying to find food and a place to sleep. But one day the dark colored dog was lefted out in the cold while a loving family toke in the white dog , into their warm home. My brother feel so uncomfortable with that book, he decided to take it back that same night.     Libraries can contain very offensive things that can make a person sick to their stomachs. Offensive thing can hurt a persons feelings, and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book. Eventhough my brother found a book that he disliked, he still continues to go to the library to find excellent books to read. Libraries are fun to go to, but they can contain very offensive thing that can hurt a person's feelings.

Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes. Do you think that censorship should be used? Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism. I disagree with the idea of Censorship. Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions; however, that is what makes our world so individualized.     Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually. The government does not want the society, especially the youth, of @LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate. Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself? When you read books, you see language being block out, they take parts out to make the book seem more classy, also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol. A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society. I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors woud leave some of the things that they censor, in the book. I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them; however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things.     This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable. Censorship such as in the book, @ORGANIZATION1 is being used. The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive. This is understandable also. I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way. The language was not meaning to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when @PERSON1 was alive. If it were not for books like this, how would out society learn about not only @LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history? In all fairness, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1.     Censorship in movies is also growing. Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature. I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do. I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine. Imagination can scare people. Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal; but what is normal? It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people.     This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism. The word conformism means to all become one; to conform. If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas; we will all just be citizens of @LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds

wow thats racist. as i said when i saw the movi white men cant jump. yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly i thought it was funny i enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people. its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that.      everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. but its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you. see now i have a since of humor. when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself. i didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny.     to kill a mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and i can see why. it had the @CAPS1 word in there a lot. but back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. he wasnt offending you.      if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body.     in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on. and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run.

Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same.     Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things. Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction. Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us want to read but none of us should read or even write in the first place. Then there are books that have a childs story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library.     Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music. They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music.The music of this world is very diverse.     The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't,be  good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce.There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational.     So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is.Next time your in a library, just use discretion
<START>

Every library has tons of information on just about everything.  There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information.  There is even some information that some people might take offence to.  On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it.  I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.     The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries.  Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race.  Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about.  Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race.  This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.     Libraries have all kinds of information.  I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain.  Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know
<START>

In my opinion, books, movies, magazines, ect., should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to some people. this is because everyone has different views on everything. Another reson is because for learning purposes in schools and etc. As well as authors would not want to be writting books because the books shelves are empty and their books, movies, magazines are getting rejected.     Since most people have different veiws on everything then,   every book or magazine would be taken off the shelf if they were offensive because, therefore, there would not be any book or magazine left on the shelf. This is because people think different things are offensive so what somebody thinks is offensive it @MONTH1 not be to another person. Therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive.      Another problem with taking 'offensive' books of the shelf is that it would be a result in people not learning in schools and ect. This is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars, slavery, and politics. If all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this. In conclusion noboby would be being taught why these events happened and  why these events are wrong, so people would not have changed, they would keep doing these things because they were not taught not to. This in my opinion would cause alot of conflict between people and nobody would be educated on these events of history.      On the other hand rather than books being taken off the shelf books would not be being put on the shelfs. In this I mean that authors, producers, would not be making movies or writting books because their work just keeps getting rejected. Not only rejected but nobdy is going to go through the time and effort to make one of these for it to be rejected because it was offensive. In my opinion it would almost be impossible for these authors/ directors to make a unoffensive book or movie for everyone that is going to read or watch it.      In conclusion I have read many books in class every year that offends at least one person, but this person can choose not to finish the movie, book, or magazine if they find it offensive, or they never have to read it again. In conclusion there are many reasons why books should stay on the shelf even if they are offensive to someone. This is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened, and people would not be reading any books in school. As well as authors would not be writting since their books are getting removed and the shelves are empty

Why should we be more carefull of what we get at the libary? Libaries can have books with knowledge, fun, rommance, and action or adventure, but some can be desterbing and grusium. Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornagerfy or grusium action. This causes the kids to act in different ways. They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children. They are sneeky and do things behind the parents back. Why is because they think they need to act this way because its cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly. 'So take them out' is some of the parents are saying now a days.     Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left. Because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind. So why do we need to be more carefull with the books we put in our libary and the books we take out of our libary? It causes the world to change very fast.     Now libarys are a great place for kids to learn. Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge. The libary is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to. Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy. From my point of view libary is one of my most favorites places to be. Any where there are books involved count me there. Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventeres that some of us will never get to do.     Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families. Some of them causes us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior. If we try to take out some of these books it will help the familes to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild. Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world. Which really its just  the books and ect... that causes our mind to picture things that make us think we need them.      Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today. Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander. Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces. I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful. Magazines can help us with research or just to now what is happening in this world today.      They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decerating, on how to decerate your weddings and etc... Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then. Like watching docromentries, they are on people or what happened in our past. We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without.      So why do we need to be more carefull for what we put in libaries? It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams. So how can we help to solve this problem? We can take out  books, magazines, movies and etc... that are really bad for our mind. So it can help our children to grow up well behavied and mature. Also one more thing books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right. How do we know we got a good book? We find right books for us by following our heart and our instinkes

Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing

Many pepole think that offensive material should be removed from the libary because children could pick then up and look in them. I do not belive this should be done.     They already have a childrens section if a child looks in a inappropiate book outside of the childrens section then its thier fault. I do not think it should inconvience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that cd,game,book, or movie they were looking for. It is very hard to come across a inapropiate book without looking for it on purpose. It could be a book used for teaching health or nursing class and is not meant to be inapropiate at all.          These are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate. Who knows we might have to vote on it someday

Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember. Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve?     What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it? Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published? Publishers do read the books they publish them, they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magizine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway.                                         In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing. It is never the parents fault.                                             If people pull unsensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and thats just my opinion. I know that i have no say in it and thats ok i can still believe that i am right. Thank you for your time

When you were a child how much did you learn from books?  Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings.  All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive.  Children have to learn these things some time in their life and I think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life.  There are also freedoms in the @LOCATION1 that grant us freedom of speech.  Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well?     Authors are brilliant people.  Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read.  We should all respect authors and what they put into their books.  This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what the he or she chose to put in it.       When I was a child I picked up on everything.  I was a very inquisive as any kid my age would be.  I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles.  There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence.  However on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house.  There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves!  The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books.  As I grew older, I began to dwelve into more adult books such as politics and religion.  I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books.  Without those books in that library I would have never been able to research those topics.     There is an amendment in our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 that  promotes freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1.  This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the @CAPS2 of anybody else.  The definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please.  Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value.       Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them.  Some books @MONTH1 have material that might not belong in the hands of children.  Children need to learn those things sometime in their life.  Why not now?  Books are what have taught all of us.  Please let them keep teaching

Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a section made for adult readers only.  This way no children would see the book anyway.       If an offensive book is in a school or any other place that the readers are children for the majority than it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf.     All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience.
<START>

I think that everyones opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library.     Do I believe that certian books should be removed from the library: yes and no. The reason why I choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for there class and their research for whatever class they need it for. Another reason why I say no is because of the fact, if the book offense you then dont read the book or think about what is says just leave it alone.     The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows some hurtful words in there towards other thats refering to the people thats its talking about then yes it needs to be removed before others start using thoes kinds of hurtfuls words to the piers or  thier elders. If the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to removed asap. If others get ahold of these kinda books then everyone would use them agianst each other which in relsult of that would cause an outbreak of fights people aruging with each other, just pure hate between thoes people using it agianst the different races.     These are my opinions of removing some books that contains hurtful things or meaning in them that can contain voilence in them or call another person out of thier name or race
<START>

Should censorship be used on library books? Obviously if you are talking to an adult then yes, more than likely they don't want their pupils to be learning inappropriate words, but if you ask any student the same question you will probably get mixed answers. Some might say' I don't appreciate hearing or reading those words,' others might say' sure why not, I hear them on televison, see them on the internet, my parents say them so why can't I read them.' To me personally I don't think it's that big of a deal to have a few inappropriate words in a book, but they shouldn't be allowed on shelfs in a middle school's library or lower. High school and up I think that its okay to have on the shelves in magazines, books, music and movies.     When I was a child my mother always said don't cuss, but growing up in an enviornment where the overwhelming majority of people you talk to cuss, then after awhile it comes out like normal words. So why not have it in the books, and movies? It's not like we don't know what the words mean. If they hurt your feelings then you know not to read, listen or watch it again. I'm not saying cuss words are good and that it's ok for them to be in every sentence you say, but hearing or reading a few won't kill you.     In some cases, cuss words are good for a story. Sometimes your reading a book and someone gets in an argument, you don't even realize it till the argument is over, but with sometimes when there is a cuss word, you stop and say,' @CAPS1 something is going on here, and I want to know what it is.' @CAPS2 catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened.     Consequently; movies, books, music, and magazines with foul language does have an affect on our youth.  A lot of children are cussing at an early age, but thats just how people communicate, show emotions, and get someones attention. Censorship can take away a lot from a book, overall making it less interesting, so again I believe censorship should not be a deciding factor in choosing a book, movie, music or magazine. Choose it because it looks interesting and its something you might enjoy

There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.     First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof. High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted.     Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone.        Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games. Their lazyness causes obesity. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons. Children being obeast causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late.      In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures. There still time for change, so lets do something about it. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for good

I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think that books should be censored. There are no books, besides maybe math books, that @CAPS1'@CAPS2 offend at least one person or a group of people. Books are an important part of the learning system. If a certain book offends you then you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 have to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. @CAPS4's that simple. there is no need to over react to words on paper. Besides there are more important issues at the moment.     While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that. People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example. A better example would be the parents or gaurdians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose. One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through. As you can see if people can live with that then we can definantly handle an offensive book.      Censorship causes blidness. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive. All men are created equal, right? So they'd have to censor the book. If a book offends you that much then listen up, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Just because a book is offensive to you doesn'@CAPS2 mean @CAPS4's offensive to everyone. sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor @CAPS4 and then we @CAPS1'@CAPS2 learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them. The point is if a p erson can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper.

This is what's wrong with today's society. We are too soft.We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples feelings. And I say that to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different. I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are. Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race.      Anybody ever think of that? If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from lifes normalcies. They've gotta learn sometime. Life isn't lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Everytime I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own
<START>

I don't Believe in censorship of libraries. Were @CAPS1 we live in a free country, and have the right to have access to the matrial we want from libraries. It doesnt matter if its age aproprite or not. If you dont want your kids listening to that bad rap artist, or watching that @CAPS2 rated movie, then its your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them.     Part of what makes @LOCATION1 so great is the freedom that come with living here. If we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to. Katherine paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hompe none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' this quote shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf we wouldnt have any books left.     Censorship would just be the start.It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know. which would take away the greatness of @LOCATION1, we wouldn't be free.     Censorship of libraries would take away our rights. witch is why i apose it

Should books, magazines, music, movies, and ect. be censored for certin age levels? No they should'ent. Books can be very educational. Sometimes you can't even find a book with out bad things in them. Even if they do, sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country.     Books can't be censored from children. Why you ask? Because the reason people read books is to learn. To learn about love, math, history, and much more. These books are writen by adults, not for adults, but for everyone to read. I read lots of books, and every book that I read I learn someting new.     Back in the ninetinth and twentith centerys, cursing was huge in books. But it wasent just to curse, it was to show the full dioulge of the character. It also set the mood of the era, and the place, where the story is being held. Such as in war books the characters curse a lot. The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was,' @CAPS1!!' That isn't how the character would act. The man would curse his lungs out. Not literly but when the author writes what someone would truely say, the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book.     As the quote says, everyone has the same right to read, which is true. Its true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in. Right? I myself strongly belive they everyone should choose what they want to learn about, and then have the freedom to do that.     So should books in a library be censored? No defenitly not. its the best way for people to learn what life is really like. Sometimes you can learn anything with out reading a book with curse words, sex, or violance. People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age. But it wont, it will only show them how not to act. And can only create a better person.
<START>

I belive if the books, music, movies, magazines and etc. are offensive and are bad that they should be removed, the reason being is because of younger children.       Younger children are not aloud to be exsposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertand to them. Since there are books, music, movies, magazines and etc. that are bad and offensive, then I would suggest a room or some sort of place that they can be held and were only adualts can be around them and can get to them.      Movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me. There are more bad things in them then in books or music. Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that. If there happen to be a book, music, movie, or magzine that you or any other person thinks that is inaproprete or offensive then you or that person would have permision to take it off and show it the main desk, and let them know what you think about it.     I feel that they should seperated the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe. They should steel be aloud to have censorship books, music, movies, and magazines because adult can handle that kind of material to where younger children can't. So therefore to keep everything sepreate, and there shouldnt be no problem.

Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly.  In other peoples eyes you @MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences.  All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy' they have been apart of.  You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with, that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can.     Opinions are alternated often about many different things, being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often.  In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way.  Exceptence is what' key to making eveyone get along at some point, but people struggle with homophobia.       Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions.  It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other.  It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree' with you @PERCENT1, unless there pretending to be something there not.  From life experiences from parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday.     All in all I believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see.  I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across.  It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through.
<START>

I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from. Some books @MONTH1 seem bad, but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine.     Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1. On many occations he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth. He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book.      When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning.      After several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it. He figured that one would not hurt. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time. He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried.     He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read. The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had know other way home than to drive. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk. When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time. A semi hit him in the left side of his car.       After thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party. He was grounded for two months. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well.     Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf. The story in wach book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in a real life situations. I know that books help me figure out many things. Even what to do and what not to do. If you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read

Do I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be romoved from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, I think they should be romoved from the shevles if they are found offensive to some or the majority of people. Some can be a bad influence on younger kids. Some can be offensive to someone's race or religion. It could also be offensive to people based on who they are or what they do.                                                                                                                  Some materials should be romoved because of the kind of infuence they have on younger kids. Some books can have violent language and actions in the book. Most magazines have inappropiate articles that they should not be reading or even looking at. The music nowadays are very explicit and do not need to be in hands of kids. Some parents don't even care about the music but it is one of the biggest influential things out. So that's one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be romved from shelves.                                                                                                                                       There are a lot of music and movies that are very offensive to certain races and religion. Hip @CAPS1 is one of the most explicit kinds of music and is very offensive to all kinds of religion and some race of people. Movies are the same with music. Magazines have certain articles that are racist and certain articles that are very offensive to certain religions.                                                                                                                 A lot of magazines have stories about celebreties that are very bad, sad, and private. In the past there have been some celebreties that sued some magazines and newspapers that put the wrong story out or something too private out.                                                                                                               Those are just some ways and reasons why certain books, movies, music and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. No one knows how people feel abouit themselves or things around them

NO, I dont think music.movies.magazines, and etc., should be moved from libraries because whats a libaray with only books? In even though you have to read and be quity and be seated. You can have music while on the computer and you can watch and check out movies you @MONTH1 like. And the magazines to keep you updated with the newest fashion on new looks or something thats going on and our community.Music is what you wont to listen when you come to the libary. It smoothing up the vibe and if you @MONTH1 be and a bad mood that music you @MONTH1 like @MONTH1 claim you down in put you and a better one. It relax you. You can be on the computer and still listen to music. While reading a good book you can be listing to music.Movies is a good source when and the libary. You can watch movies while and the libary and check some out. In take home and watch. You can watch all types of movies. Movies you @MONTH1 like and it also can be movies you @MONTH1 need for a project or even educatoinal movies. If you wont to leran about nature, animals,or even a @CAPS1 person from the @DATE1. Its always good for a movie and the libary.Magazines and a libary is very helpful. Because while you @MONTH1 be waiten on something or it could be on the computer you can seat and grab a magazine. In the libary its a varity of magazines you can read like sports,fashion,nature,cartoon,animals and etc. So magazines is very helpful and a libary.Thats why i say no, because it shoudnt be removed from  libraries becouse you can do lots of great things and the labary besides just reading a book and getten on a computer. Movies magazines and music is helpful and a libary to. Who just wont to get on a computer and read a book. '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'.

The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads. It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive. There are many ways to approach this question.     Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct'? Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victim. It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work.      Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable. But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access. I believe it is the resposiblity of the parent to determine such restrictions. If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them. If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection. It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided.     I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author. My creations are expressions that I give for world to enjoy and think about. To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts. Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets.     There are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries. What guidlines do you have in determing excluding the offensive materials? If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group? It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine whats offensive and whats not.            In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library. It is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live. Its ability to do such should not be compromised.

In third grade, I took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover. It was rather large, but I had come to love reading in that time of my life so I decided I was up for it. The genre of the book was fantasy which I enjoyed immensly. Although, there were some parts of the book that had me confused. There were scenes involving women that I did not understand, and many new words. Eventually, I came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book. He read the passage, and his eyes went wide. I never finished that book.     There is no doubt that I had a learning experience by reading that book, but, as my dad obviously thought, it @MONTH1 have been a little too much for that time in my life. If it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it, my dad would have had a little chat with that library. Now that I am old enough to understand what was going on in that book, I realize that I lost some of my innocense because of it. There is simply some material that is not appropriate for children, and it should not be put in our public libraries. Not censoring what is put on the shelves seems obsurd considering my experience. If I have a son someday, I want to be the one telling him about the touchy subjects of women and swearing; it should not be from some fiction book. I also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries. The music that I see has artists that write their songs without children in mind, movies have up to @NUM1 ratings, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references.     Overall, it is disappointing to me that our libraries have allowed some of these things onto their shelves. As I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I had never seen that book. Maybe it would have allowed me to keep a little more innocense for a little bit longer, and maybe I would have respected women more through my youth. I would love to see more censorship in libraries so that we can protect today's children until the parents choose to open their eyes to the world.

Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of?  A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how @CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.       If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech.  Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it.  It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by.  If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone.  In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.     Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.  It will still be around.  It is just something in our world that we have to live with

Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive? Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them? @CAPS2 is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into:     If one person finds a @CAPS1 offensive but no one else does, should @CAPS2 be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions. This is because they know people like @CAPS2 and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find @CAPS2 offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have @CAPS2 removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item.     If the library removes the offensive item, they @MONTH1 lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they @MONTH1 lose a customer. So they are faced with a dillemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' @CAPS2's a tough decision to make especially when they @MONTH1 lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They @MONTH1 poll the customers and see what they think, they @MONTH1 do nothing at all, or they @MONTH1 remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if @CAPS2's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love @CAPS2 so much, but can't afford to buy @CAPS2 at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' @CAPS3 is they just don't want to agknowladge other people's' choices, feelingings, opinions, etc.     So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for @CAPS2 to be removed? Say nothing? @CAPS2 is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do. So think about other people's' possible feelings, thoughts, opinions in mind before making a decision.

If you were offinded by a book in the library would you want it took off the shelf? I wouldn't there is no point in removing it there are a lot of books that offend people, that one book isn't just towards you the same goes for movies and music.      Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people. Some people @MONTH1 not find the same thing offending like you do everyone dont think alike. If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today. This is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out.          Movies are anoter way of getting you emotions or expressing yourself. People find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it. We are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies. No one or no race is the center of attetion in movies people @MONTH1 feel as if they are but thats a personal thing people @MONTH1 go through.     Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people. Music @MONTH1 be found most offending now days but, music is also away of getting emotions and freedom of speech out. I've never felt offended because of a song i've heard or anything people are going to say what they feel and want.     Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world people either gotta het used to it or stay offended. Books,music,movies, or magazines wont be pulled because of emotions. I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things

Many books and material in libaries are sometimes offensive to certian people but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves of libaries. Material that might be offensive to one person might have a valuable intrest in another person. If you hated the subject of history and had the right to take it away, then someone else might come along and take away a subject you like like, science. If it is offensive to the general public, it should be placed in a special scection, be avaible behind the counter, or avaible only at specific libaries.     Throught the libaries of the world, there are two general sections, adult, kid, and entertaminet sectioons. In these sections locate many topics and many views of ceartian things. Sometimes it is very offensive and it is almost 'hidden' from view and have to spend all day looking for it. It should be that contreverstial topics should be kept in a closed off section of the libary and can be accesed by the staff so that way none of the pubic can worry.      Like cigarretes at a store, somethings should be behind the counter where the material can have a watchfull eye over it. These subjects include sex, racisim, porn, polotics, and other material like the ones listed. With these items behind the counter, people will not know about it and it will be hidden from view, but still acesiable with special order or request. This would help the public.     Some material, when reached to a specific town, can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community. Some material should be denied from entering small towns and the specified material can only be aquired at large libaries or specific book stores. With material far away, people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community. This is why some material should only have premettid acess under watchfull guard
<START>

I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. The way i look at it is, is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions. Not everyone is going to think alike.     As an example some people are against blacks and others are not. Everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever.      Not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do. Don't read it if it offends you, but just cause it offends you doens't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it.

All throughout the world there are libraries.  Librairies have all different kinds of materiel stacked upon shelves.  Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not.  I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves.  Yes, i understand some of this material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this.     If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, ect.  I think they should be able to keep them.  Just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone won't like it.  Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions.  Isn't that what makes the world go around?       Adults @MONTH1 have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library.  I understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material.  If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries i think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go.  That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not.       We go to school for a vast amount of reasons.  Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent.  While we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us.  If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies.  We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday.  Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it?     There is alot of different kinds of material in libraries.  Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate.  I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it.  I think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm

Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are  offensive to peoples belief's, their religion, their race and just their ways of life. Therefore, i do not belive that books in libraries should be censored. I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others, but what if you found a book that was descriminating someone elses belief's but not yours. Would that still be okay with you to take those book off of the shelves?Also, taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age approprite. If you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it. You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book.           There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive. Some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything. The things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world. So if anything, the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people only show you that you will not like everything that someone writes or says.           As far as movies, they are already rated on a decent scale. If it is not age approprite, then do not watch it, or let your children. The same applys for video games and music. Censor them from your children, and do not get them censored from the whole world.      That is my opinion about censoring things from libraries. Just because you do not agree with every little thing that someone writes, does not mean that someone else in the world does not. Out of all the things that need to be censored the library is not one of them. Of all the places, taking things off of the library  shelves is not going to do justice of what really needs to be done

Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason. The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.     The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition.     The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it. Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter.     The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves. The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.     In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is.

Dear Katherine Paterson,         Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive? I honestly don't think that's nessecary because not everybody @MONTH1 find those materials offensive. If a couple people think that a certain book or something is offensive then dont read it or pay attention to it, don't take something from someone that they like.     I think that if  there was people that found a certain topic interesting and there was also people who found it offensive, that they should keep the material and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it. Either way I think that they shouldn't remove those materials, enless everyone agrees that it's offensive.That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic, just because one person found it offensive. Now if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that then maybe that can be considered being removed, but other than that I see no reason why you should take away something that some people @MONTH1 enjoy. Let's say I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food. Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else. That's just there opinion on things and you can't always get what you want, so just deal with it.      Well those are my thoughts on rather or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive. My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you don't read it or have anything to do with it. Other than that you shouldn't take materials away from people enless everyone agrees on it.                                                   Sincerly,                                                          @PERSON2

Many @CAPS1 have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not. It's depends on one's beliefs and morals. I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries.     I think that @CAPS1 should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to. Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe. It also depends on a person's age and maturity level. Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't. The situation is different for each person.     It's hard to judge certain materials because some @CAPS1 might find it acceptable while others might not. There would be contraversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable what's not, and these standards would clash with each other. It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to @CAPS1. If someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out.     I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument. For example materials can be catorgorized by maturity level. That's what movie ratings are for. Materials should be organized that @CAPS1 can easily see if they would be offensive or not. For example all the kids movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate. It should be obvious to @CAPS1 who would find it offensive and who wouldn't      @CAPS1 should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves. A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. Just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it. That being said, certain things can be done so that @CAPS1 would know if something would be offensive or not.

How would you feel if you wrote a story about your life, and someone found it offensive, so the took the book off of the shelves? I feel as if the censorship in libraries is becoming a controversial problem for the following reasons: it is wrong to take away freedoms, people have different opinions and views, and some books, magazines, or songs are trying to make people aware of dangers.     One important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is; it takes away our freedom of speech. In @LOCATION1, we have the right to speak our minds. If everything we read was censored, there would be nothing to read. The liberties and freedoms of @CAPS1 citizens should not be taken away because of something that is thought to be inappropriate.     Another reason why I believe censorship is wrong is; different people have completely different opinions on things. One person might feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive, while another person might think the book is informational and helpful. No one can base censorship on one belief or idea, because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of.      A third reason why censorship should not be inforced as much is; it takes away the awarness of the dangers in everyday life. Stories about people who were kidnapped, or were in a car crash because the person who was driving was under the influence of drugs, can be a good thing. Eventhough the story @MONTH1 have some accounts that are not appropriate, it could be very influencial, and convince someone to make the right choice. If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or people making the wrong choices, no one will be able to read a story about it and make the right choice instead of making the same mistake as the person.        Although stories or magazine articles that @MONTH1 be seen as vulgar are looked down upon, they help to make people aware, give people the freedom of speech, and allow them to have their own opinions. Censorship in libraries and media should be abolished

I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf. On the other hand i do not believe that anything rascist should be on library shelfs. Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie, nusic, and a magazine.      You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch. I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i'd pick out to watch. On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it. Also something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1, i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title. Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch. Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe. If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read. Not everyone listens to the same music but a @NUM1 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand others @MONTH1 not like it. Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you.     If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather stupid. Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to.

From my own observations I do not beleive that any materials should be removed from libraries.  All students have the right to read/learn about different subjects.  Even if that includes some of them being offensive.     Some subjects might be considerderd offensive, like the holocaust for example.  If we didnt learn about what happened during that horrific time it could possibly happen again without us even knowing that it has happened before.  But it is the students choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is cosidered offensive.     In conclusion I do not beleive that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves.  People need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better, more educated, well-rounded individual.
<START>

I do think that there should be a censorship in not just in libaries, but everywhare.       Personlly, I think that the way that the libraries have the books are appropite and if the parents do not want thier children going any where  that is not privy to them keep a hand lenght away     As for the parents, the parents know the aera that intrest them ,therefor the parents should go there

How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material. Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf.         Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't? Library's shouldn't have that accessable. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf. Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not.         Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it. Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach.         Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't. Thoes that can't, it @MONTH1 reflect something negative on them and it @MONTH1 cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys.     In @CAPS1, librarys should not supply offinsive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them. If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of @NUM1 can enter. If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.

I believe that if there are offensive books,music,movies,and magazines are in the libraries. I think they should be taking off the shelf , @CAPS1 people should not want there children's reading or looking at thing they should not be looking at. Today I'm going againt the views on the censorship in the libraries.      I think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the build for our children to read. The materials that the libraries has that are offensive should be put up in another area for older poeple. Not for the children's that go to the libraries. I'm asking the newspaper to help us to fight for what the libraries should have on there shelf for our young people and are children's.      And  what type's of book should be in the children part in the libraries on the shelf. We should have right's to take off book's on  the children side. And have rights to put offensive materials on the side for older people that like books,music,movies,and magazines but not for young children to read. The point I'm trying to make is that we should think about what our children's should be learn.     And what they should know as a young person. They should not grow up to fast like some people are .We need to make the better for our young children's. So they can do the same for there self and for there children's some day.

If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look.     When I was in the eighth grade I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There was alot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that.     If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops.      So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesnt. If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you.     These are some of my opinions about this catagory. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said

Libraries are very educational. They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for. I dont think that libraries include anything offensive. If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution. It shouldnt be removed because not everyone @MONTH1 find it offensive.          I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books, and things for you do there. I've actually gained alot of knowledge at the libraries i've been to because i found so many books that were just amazing. Never, have i ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else. Everyone is different though, we have all have a different view on things and we all are unique. If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone then maybe it should be removed but like i said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldnt be removed.           I personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then i'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed. If someone came up to me and said 'hey, i find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to' i would say, 'well, that @MONTH1 be true, but some children do listen to that music, it wouldnt be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it. Now, from my experience theres alot of things that people find offensive but personally, i think it would be outside of a library
<START>

Definately not, they @MONTH1 be offensive to some but not all. Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life, so their is no real reason to censor materials. These materials are made to entertain someone, some are entertained by offensive material. I honestly dont think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be took out.      If any material offends you, you dont have to acknowledge it, you can always check out different material. If censor material then you are going against the first amendment, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored, what happens when every book has been marked as offensive? We have no books, thats what.          Books are made by the author writing down his idea's and creating a plot, some will think his idea's are offensive but not all will. Whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books. Anyone can create material and share their idea's, those idea's could still be offensive but it doesnt matter, because we have @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it. If you ban any type of material, your prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions, then all your doing is denying the @NUM1 amendment & being a hypocrite.      Censorship of music and movies is not right either. When you censor movies and music your also censoring out their idea's. Music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion. Censorship of the movies, music, & books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture. All im saying is censorship is destroying america and hurting our progression in culture.

Have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelfs? Well if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive then there wouldn't be anything there to read. If you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you then don't read it, grab a knew one. through out this article you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraires shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic.     Movies, books, magazines and music can be offensive. If you think about it though if you get offended then don't read or listen or watch it. You just simply have to grab a new book. Now the question comes, what if its the best book or movie up there? If thats the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to. If you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves then grab one that just really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them. If he/she don't she a problem with it tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it. After you get done with that ask him/her wants a stack of the books, etc., that offend you. Thats when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her.     The libraries on the other hand if your getting bombarded with people coming in and sayin this books offends me I can't belive this on your shelves, what if a little kid got ahold of this.......!  Managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie. What do you do? In my opinion i'd read or watch maybe the first two or three but after that i'd start playin it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office. Now you gotta think, man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc. are offensive then you really got to take action. If you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales. I've been to a lbrary where everything was catagorized so people know what there looking through before they start reading which is what I think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves.     My belief on the topic is that you go into a lbrary knowing whats in a lbrary, books! Now if you go in there and theres a book or movie that alot of people complained about then i'd see them making an effort to get rid of it. But if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it. You also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you, their not singling you out.If its that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off then take it back ang grab a new one. If that book or movie is their best seller they're not going to destroy it because of one single person. So if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing whats it about then I wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it, its your choice not theirs.     This article took alot of diffrent sides which is good in a way because its not just about one single topic. However if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it then go to a different library. Maybe that library wont have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about and if there is maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you. So if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems. thanks for reading

What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people @CAPS1 created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar coat the struggles within life itself. One can not learn unless given the oppurtunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual.      With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is theraputic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was dibbed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken back? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, ' @CAPS1 deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today their will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type?     Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and down-time reading to one person @MONTH1 be the very thing that strikes a world changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored. In a discussion based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the @ORGANIZATION1's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succesion from the @LOCATION1. Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation. In that specific situation in the @ORGANIZATION1 it created a hatred and false sense of the @CAPS4 in the childrens' eyes. How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child @CAPS1 is only @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs? Through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it.      The biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publically display a controlversial topic no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career, because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library @MONTH1 decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually the world will have no art left, because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarentee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up. The world cannot be sugar coated or portrayed as perfect, because that is not lfe. Everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual @CAPS1 they are. Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public, it will just destroy an oppurtunity to grow.     Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world. No individual can say that material is not suited for the public, because they are not the public. Every person poses their own opinions on life. By banning these works of art you are banning individuality as a whole. If things like this continue our planet will become mindless zombies will no personal opinions. Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people. There is no true way to hide reality from the world. Let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world. The struggles of one person @MONTH1 be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow

Several years ago a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, The @PERSON2, her child was about to read for his english class. She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read. She was in her rights to be a little nervous about the book, there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the ciriculum. The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because even though the approprietness of one scene @MONTH1 have been in question the rest of the book taught lessons taht were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the imaortance of right and wrong and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong.     Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life. I once read a quote that said something a long the lines of understatnding leads to tolerance. We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inapproriate for a situation. Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view @MONTH1 one day lead to the solution of problems in out world today, such as the crisis in the @LOCATION1 involving the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2.     I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike we would have nothing left. A good example of this is the popular internet video site, @CAPS3. There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them. On each video there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or dislike said video. With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes. If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch.     Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly becme very boring. During the women's suffrage movment, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive. Now after many years it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote.This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better. If we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant.     All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands. We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole. I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freeedom of speech in the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech?

The old saying one should never judge a book by it's cover comes into litteral meaning with this particular subject. Every mind that is among the world is extremely different, just as every book is. One person @MONTH1 look upon a certain subject as offensive, while others @MONTH1 not have the same point of view. However, in my personal opinion books with 'suggestive' references or language should be placed in sections marked mature and clearly labeled with a warning of the contents lieing between the pages. With over a billion different points of views residing all over the world, why should books that only a few select find inappropriate people be removed?     Every person has their own life story and rough experiences. Life's journey brings bumps in the road which can scare someone deeply and change their life forever. While reading a book, a viewer @MONTH1 skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them. For one to have to relive a trauma that they have struggled to get over isn't right, but for another to read about a situation similar to a particular person's life journey could possibly grant them more understanding and compassion for the victim. I do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure. However, these books should not be taken off the shelves because people who have not had to endure a struggle such as this should be able to grasp a better understanding for the other person.      Books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who can not yet handle that topic. At a young age I selected a book I had thought was a ghost story. Mid way through I came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped. As a sixth grader I was horrified because I was not yet exposed to that danger of the world, and I was not mature enough to handle that subject. For weeks I walked the halls scaared that I might have the same fate as the girl in the story I had read. Books with mature topics should be seperated from those for younger childeren, because the description in a book @MONTH1 leave a child with emotional scares.     Labeling books clearly with any 'suggestive' content the book @MONTH1 contain would help this issue tremendously. If books are clearly labeled that they contain offensive words, comments, or horrifying situations, then a reader who will become offended will have less likely of a chance to grab the material. If children who are still developing their level of maturity come across a book that mentions inappropriate subjects, they will have a better understanding of what they @MONTH1 be about to view. By simply pressing a label on a book that states the concerns can be found within the pages, it will save the world alot of harm.     If books begin to fly off the shelves because of offensive topics, their won't be many books left to read. Every person takes a different look at what a story says, just as every age group comprehends the message that passages give differently. By monitoring and labeling books, book worms will be able make a quick decision on whether or not the material they think they want to read is for them. So, in conclusion don't take away the wanders of reading from those who enjoy traveling through the imagination of books, but let them know exactly what they will see as they mosey through the unknown pages of a new adventure.

Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area.     A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.     Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library. If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it.     Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed.     So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay. Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area

It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press. Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us? Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things? Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devestated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time.     My ninth grade year in high school, I read 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' by @PERSON1. This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the @LOCATION4 during the earlier years of the @LOCATION1. This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern @LOCATION1; one could say this book steriotypes people in the @LOCATION4. One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses. African-@CAPS6 could be offended by the explicit rascist comments and names within the pages. Despite this, 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' is considered a classic and is praised and tought throughout the @LOCATION1 and the rest of the world. I grew from reading @PERSON1's masterpiece- it tought me a lot about where the @LOCATION1 has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races. You learn from your mistakes, they say. Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes. We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention. We can stop history from repeating itsself by being well-informed.     Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures; @CAPS9 or @CAPS10'ite, @LOCATION2, @CAPS11, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION5, @CAPS12. Any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '@ORGANIZATION1,' which focuses on @CAPS13. Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music. Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes.Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them. It could limit one's exploration of interests. It could very well take away from one's personal growth.     In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion. Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society. Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be. It is best to just keep things the way they are- free.

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc ...,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?   Most of the people made books that are inapropiate or offensive and sometimes are the life of the person or some experience that they have live. But the problem is that a lot of people are not realistic and they don't thing that those is the live of person's and can be the future of more people.Peple sometimes like to be the best and can make problems with other and that mekes them happy that is a sad thing because that's bad and also they can get of the point of do things so bad that they go to jail that's are some of the experiences that people shows  but others get it wrong. well thats their problem they can do what ever they whant .  I know that live is not easy but thank's of that material we can have a better live and also we can deffence ourselves.  Also i don't think that they  need to be remove that books or magazines because that's what help us to have e better life and also in the future, they need to be in there and if people found them offensive just don't go there or don't see that materials ignore them more people like those and thinkthat are helpful for them and for me.   I don't think that they goin to have a bad material in there, things that are inapropiate i thing that they can't have bad or  nasty information in a place that a lot of people go and not only adult also childre's  go too. And that's is more inappropriatefor kids. People know what's going on in there and some others persons know too. the world sometimes is a danger and sometimes help us for grows up that's is a good thing but we hace the choise if we want to read or have that information.  I remember one time when i read a book that is kind of sad but that help me to know better our life it was about two boys the book has a lot of bad words and talk really bad bad olso that explain more the book and we learn more about it. that's some things that help us with life. One of the books, magazines,music,movies .etc  that we can write is our life because we pass a lot of difficults times and that is a book of our life and can be a inappropriate book of our live.people like me give the tanks to those peoples that publish they experiences and at the same time help us

I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be aloud to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries. We have to ask our selves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just down right boring?     Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We @MONTH1 have the right to take down the books but why should we. It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of stuff the our children should know about, such as the slavery, and famous people.     What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other then the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropraite off the shelves of the library there wouldn't be anymore books. Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books.      Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell u who wants to do that. Nobody,'' it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you @MONTH1 like to, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books they can't.      We don't need to take any books out of the libraries? There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, cause there isn't any good ones. We are just taking away something that is really big to us @CAPS1, and without those books there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do so why take them

I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries. This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic.     I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of @PERCENT1 of them because... well I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen.          Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book @MONTH1 talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer.     Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief.     All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose.

What do you want your child being exposed to?    In my own opinion I believe that @CAPS1 shouldn't be taken off the shelfs, because kids know what books are appropriate and innappropriate for them. This @CAPS2 why the library has @CAPS3 'kids' selction away from the 'adult' selction. They know their boundaries, and I don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything innappropriate. The library @CAPS2 a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out.   Also, @CAPS3 not just librarys', @CAPS1 can be seen or heard from schools, on the radio, t.v. and video games. Any where you go they're more likely going to see innapropriate actions that take place. So as a parent @CAPS3 your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible.       The only way a child can be exposed to this @CAPS2 if their parents are unattended and irresponsible. Someday your kids will ask questions about that that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students. Just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter.      I know alot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot from violent video games, music about drugs, alchol, and sex. @CAPS1 really bothers me, because when I was their age I had no idea what @CAPS1 even was or meant. @CAPS1's wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know @CAPS1 has a label on @CAPS1 saying '@CAPS10 @CAPS11', '@CAPS12'  or '@NUM1'.      Every time I hear a child say something about this aweseome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs, violence and etc, the children tend to get younger and younger every time. I don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unecessary stuff

NEWSPAPER     @CAPS1 today im going to tell you what I think on offensive materials in libraries.Offensive materials such as books,magazines,music,movies are found in libraries to some people.But to others they can think its perfectly ok to have in a public place.Thinking somethings offensive is just an opinion and every person has a different look on things.     The first thing I have to say about this topic is that these items should not just be taken off the shelves and thrown away.Some people can find these items very educational and they might be able to relate to that  book that other people would say is offensive.And if offensive materials are really bothering some people and the libraries are getting alot of complaints they should just make a section in the library just for the offensive books,movies,ect.So people wont have to look at those offensive materials.Another thing is that libraries are a public place and they should have a wide range of books,movies,ect.Because not every one likes the same thing.People have different intrests and outlooks on different things.So people should just except the things that they might not be into because other people might be really into that.And dont always just think about yourself look at the big picture.     So there are some of my thoughts and feelings on what I think about offensive materials in libraries.And I hope that you can see my point that im trying to get across.

Do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see.No, I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see.Cause the staff shouldn't let the children in that area without a parent were the uncensored books, magazines, movies, music and etc.      But it's know ones fault because the media staff that works in the library shoudn't allow the younger kids to go in that area were those things are unless their guardian are with them. Unless they allow them in the area were the books, movies, magazines, etc.The kids should have a certain part of the library were they can take books from that's inappropiate for them.     There's alot of books that children shouldn't be able to read but they read anyways without adults permission.And yes their some books,that's not inappropiate for the little ones and the big kids.Thing's like that is offensive toward the parents how the staff just let them read in see things like that in the parents wonder why, an how there children learning things like that.     Certain things should be posted for things that kids shouldn't be able to see an read and do.And yes I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read, see things their not suppose to see.They know those things not appropiate for them so why would they let them watch or do or see stuff like that.     My conclusion yes I think certain things that don't suppose to be were they suppose to be for young children to see.That's not right to let them see things like that. So that's why I'm writing this essay to the newspaper arguing on whats right for allowing them to see uncensored things they are not to see
<START>

Do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive? From my point of view yes, because libraries are public which means they are open to any and everyone. Kids could see a photo that @MONTH1 not be appropriate for them, people of different religion could hear foul language, and it could give some libraries a bad image. I can relate to this because I have also heard some things that I am not proud of such as foul language. That effected me because when I heard it I went around people who were positive in my life saying it to them.     Of course, this could effect a child in a negative way. Kids grow up to be as positive as they can, atleast thats what parents teach them and if they get hooked on things they see they will try to immitate it. From my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline. But if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects they will learn the hard way. This is a reason I wish censorship was in our local libraries.     Also, people of different religion could find it offensive. We have different consumers that walk in and out of the library everyday, so when they enter they should find it peacful not the opposite. For example a muslim could walk in the library and here others listening into music with nothing but profanity. Now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and he can say the library has no restrictions. At times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits.     Then, the library has a bad image which is a big problem. When something gets a bad look sooner or later it will not be there anymore. Meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another. For example when you leave the library the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library. But if problems constantly happen there they will leave and tell their friends this is not a good library. Then those figures add up then finally you struck out and it's gone.          Now, if they are not removed this is what can happen. Children will immitate what they see or heard, complaints will be filed on that library. If I had a problem with the restriction levels at the library I just would stop going. And if that library can not help it atleast have the courtesy to mark the sections of the library. This will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read

I beleive that certian things such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should and shouldn't be taken off of the shelf. The reason i think that  they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them. If people don't like them, or they think that it is offensive, they shouldn't go to that library.     I don't get offended by anything. When I am going through the library I have seen people get offended by some of the  things that they have on the shelfs. Reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing. People that read things and get offended by it, should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not.     The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriete. It might not be good for the eyes of people.     I think that all libraries should carry the same content in them. So that way noone is making a big deal about what is on the shelves.

Yes, I think that some books should be taken out of all libraries. No little kid should be looking at or saying those things. Some of the books could offend some people when they don't know it.      Parents need to watch what there kids read and watch on a daily basis. Kids need to know why they shouldn't watch those shows or read those books. Maybe if parents would watch there kids they would mind better than what they do.      Some of the books could offend people when they don't know it. No little kid should be looking at or reading those books or movies. That is why i think those books should be taken out of all libraries
<START>

AS WE ALL KNOW, ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN A LOCAL, BOOK STORAGE FACILITY, COMMONLY REFERED TO AS A LIBRARY. ALL KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE IS IN THIS LITTLE AREA, BUT, IS SOME OF THAT INFORMATION INAPPROPRIATE ENOUGH TO BE IN A PUBLIC PLACE?     MANY LIBRARIES @MONTH1 POSSESS ON THEIR SHELVES BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AND EVEN MUSIC CONTAINING EXPLICIT MATERIAL, AND HOW COULD YOU AVOID IT? IN A MODERN WORLD, THERE'S GOING TO BE LANGUAGE AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES THAT WOULD BE FOUND OFFENSIVE TO OLD PEOPLE AND VIEWERS OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING. YES, I AGREE SME MATERIAL CAN AND SHOULD BE IN SEPARATE AREAS THAT MAINSTREAM MATERIAL, BUT ON A WHOLE, WHO CARES?I MEAN, MOST ORDINARY PEOPLE DON'T. I KNOW I DON'T. CENSORSHIP IS STUPID, BECAUSE MOST OF THE STUFF IN LIBRARIES, IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT YET, YOU WILL SOON, NO MATTER WHAT CENSORSHIP STEPS ARE TAKEN BY LIBRARY OFFICIALS
<START>

I believe libraries should have all types of books, music, movies, and magazines. I believe if libraries had limited things that alot of people would not come to the library. For example, if I wanted to get a certain book for school and the library does not have it i don't no were else I would go. The library should have a variety of books if not what if the point of a library. Some books might be to explicit for a child to read.      For music I think a library should be limited.I think music should be limited because alot of music has cursing in it. I don't think everyone wants to hear that type of music in a library. I dont think a person should be able to listen to music in the library anyways because a library is suppose to be quiet. But also people who listen to that type of music might be disappointed. Some music might be to bad for some chlidrens ears.     For movies I think they should have an age limited for children. Thats simple kids should be able to only watch kid movies. Teenagers should be aloud to watch kid movies and teen movies. Adults should be able to watch all movies. That is how it should go.     For magazines they should have all types of magazines. They should have them from child to adult but in different sections. For example, All the children magazines should go with the children books. All the adult magazines should be with the adult reading books. Some magzines are to explicit but the library should make sure the magazines stay in the adult section.      Some books are offensive but there books and a library is there to provide books. All kind of books should be in the library no matter what in my opinion. I've never experience a nasty, or explicit book. So if anything is explicit keep it in the adults only section. Every book should be in the library

We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen  @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way.  Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics.  Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway.      If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it?  Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited.  They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words.  This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean.      However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music?  Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand.  Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things.      In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored.  Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines.  Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians.  There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out

They were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf. But if the author had the right to remove the book from the shelf - that work I abhor, then everyone else should have the same right to remove the book from the shelf. But then, they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read. They think that they should get some books that are not found offensive. This is what they should do about books that are found offensive.     If kids were reading books that the author found offensive, they should get rid of them. The books that were found offensive should not be read at all. Books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read. Offensive books should not be anywhere you are at. If you are going to read a book, do not get a book that is offensive.     Non-offensive books like @CAPS1, those kinds of books are not very offensive. If books were not offensive, people would read them very often. If people were to read books very often, there would not be enough @CAPS1 to do anything else. We do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them. People deserve to have better and not offensive books.     Every day we read books, but do we know if they are offensive. If we did not know about the books we are reading were offensive, then we would be saying things right out of the book that we should not be saying. If we say stuff right out of the offensive book, we would get in severe trouble. Getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment. When you get punished, it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of @CAPS1.     In conclusion, you understand what you can and cannot read. You also understand about what to do with offensive books. That non-offensive books can make you learn something. You can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books. And that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of @CAPS1.

The way that the books, musics ,ect. are made for people basicly for that age group. Like if that particular book contains profanity that some find offensive, then they should ignore that book and move on to the other book that is more fitting for that person rather than starting a controversy over that just of one book. Some stuff will have lables on them like parental guidence to show that only particular age person can have. From my experience is that it's ok, but if it gets out of hand then I just leave it and go to the next thing. Although rmoving the books from most people might not help alot because some people would like to have that book that they won't find anywhere else. The librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library and have the kids book in the younger section of the library. So hopefully this might help the problem that you might have for people to enjoy that books, music, magazine, ect.

Do you think there should be any books movies madaines etc tooken off the shelfs? Will if so then you should read my newspapper actle.     I don't think that there is any books etc, that i would take off the shelfs. There are many books etc that kids should read, but you can tell your kids not to read them, or if they do start to read them take the book away from them.      There are some books that kids shouldn't read, but only you can stop them from reading them. They willl always try to find away to get what they want. so taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good, because they'll find the book movie ets somehow. The only way to make such is to keep your kids over watch, and to make such they do son't the stuff you don't want them to do.         In conculusion taking books off the shlef would't help anyone out, but just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you  don't want them to be around

If I owned or worked at a librarie, I would have books, music, movies and magazines that to many people are offensive. But I would not have the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the childrens area of the librarie.But I would have them in the adult area.         @CAPS5 I would keep that type of books, music or movies might you ask? Well because the adult and older tenageers should be able to handle and act like adult when reading the book, watching the movie, listening to music. If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town then i will completly remove the item from the shelf. Its that simple.           If parents get mad and angree because of these books, movie, and music don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them. Pick out a childs book like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, don't pick out a book from @PERSON1. Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color. Watch @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 not @CAPS3 on a @CAPS4.         My questions is, '@CAPS5 not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive?' @CAPS6 people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music. People live in defferent worlds even though we all live in one.      In my oppenion offensive books, music and movies should stay in libraries. Just little and younger kids shouls not read, watch or listen to them
<START>

Books, music, movies, and much more, being removed off  of the self because no one liked them and find some of them offensive does not not mean to get rid of them. Many enjoy them, and could use them for shool research or topics for a class.     First of all I know for a fact that some of the music my friends and I listen to would bother many other people, it was clearly our chioce to buy the music, book, or movie. We all have different opinions on what 'good' music or movies are. I can understand why some people would want us to get rid of it because of the foul language or racial slurs, but it is our money and our decision to buy it. Many teens take the music thing out of control and turn it up so loud that it will let @LOCATION1 hear it and with all the word and comments then make in the music I can see why adults don't want us to buy it. In respect for others I think we can turn down the radio, don't make comments to movies, and don't be immature with the books.      Second, All the research and studying we have to do in school, it would be pointless to not be able to have books or magazines to do our research with. Now a days the students get to pick what they want to do a topic over and if they want to do that topic bad enough then I am pretty sure they have the material to look up the information on that subject.      I do realize that it gets out of control with the music, movies, magazines, and books but we know when to settle down and grow up. Teens who are going to be immature about it does not deserve to have all those things. We just have to learn to use it with respect. Just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school believe it or not
<START>

yes because what if a @NUM1 year old could find a offensive to have a book that talks about his race in a bad way. Now if a man walks in and finds a offensive book about his race he @MONTH1 take the shitchuration to a new level like maby he @MONTH1 demand it to be taking off the shelf or somthing else. If a women walks in with her son or daughter and find a dirty nasty book about sex, drugs, guns and knifes.     So yes a offensive book should be taken off a shelf if the book or books are in a public libeary. Only reason the books should be taken off the shrelf is because if its a public libeary alot of kids and their pearents to read, do research and do homework.     And that is why a public libaery should take a offensive book off their shelf

I belive that they need to keep every thing and gain more. Their is so much to luearn about. The more information you have the better. I for one think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information. Thow you can not trust every thing in one, You can still find many facts about what your wanting to learn about. On the other hand, Children should not be able to reach or see some of this. I could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about. The fact is they need to have people watching the stuff so kids wont get in it and we can still lurean and find out new things. Not everything should be hidden. The more you know could just save the world.

I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. @CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules. Like buying a rated '@CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is @NUM1, and not @NUM2 years old, but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law. I say shrew the law, because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4, its the parents right to tell/show there kid about things, not the goverment.      I Think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly, and I think we should. @CAPS5 have to follow what ever rules untill there @NUM2 years of age: @CAPS3? I wish I knew @CAPS3, but I dont. Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them.           For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen.     Video games, They are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like '@CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murders.' @CAPS4 makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that.      I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about @CAPS4 all they cant even handle @CAPS4. Its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world. Just because they have been kept away from all that all there life.     I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them @CAPS4 was bad, and never watch/read @CAPS4? Where did they hear @CAPS4 from? I beleive @CAPS4 came from the media @CAPS4 self. I can see the headlines now, '@CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murders.' Then they would have some made up percentage on how manny @CAPS5 turn in to a murder that watch @CAPS6 movie compare to @CAPS5 that don't.     What I am really saying is that I try not to let other peoples beleifs get in my head and change my own beleifs. Even by me writing this @MONTH1 have cause someone to change there beleifs, and I really @CAPS1 hope I haven't.
<START>

Do I belive that some books, movies, magazines, or ext., shuold be removed do to the fuct some people might find them offensive? NO, I belive that every should have the chance to see it to other then the just the people how did and thought it was offensive. Someone could really like it or a group of people could.Even if some people find an object offensive someone else might need that object for something like school work.     Lets say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries becuase people find it offensive. Then a local school has a praject on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now do to somebody elses dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do thier reshearch.     It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive. The libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from. So no i don't belive that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or ext., do to the fact that some other people @MONTH1 find them offensive.

Twilight, @PERSON1, or even The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series are books that many guardians do not allow their children to read due to their beliefs on what is real and what is not. Magic, spells, and vampires many of us know are not real but others do not believe in what it is that is being taught to the younger readers. My personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. But there would be certain circumstances where I would have to put my foot down and censor things such as sex and drugs just because that is not suitable for young children to be reading at that young of age.     The reason why I would have a low tolerance of the censorship is because different people like different things. If someone was an athelte they might not find a book about cooking and cleaning very appealing. As if a person that was a cook might not find a book about athletics too appealing either. Just because one person has different beliefs or what their standard is for offensive would not change my stand point on the censorship of certain articles. Different beliefs of certain people is understandle but, just because you don't believe it doesn't mean that everyone else is going to right there not believing it with you. Dont't ruin it for the others who enjoy the interesting fact of a male @CAPS1 falling in love with a normal @CAPS3 girl just like you and me.      Another reason why my censorship in libraries is because it would give my library more variety. If there was twenty different @PERSON1 books on the shelves many people would be able to look at them and check them out as they please. Also, if you didn't know what kind of book you wanted to check out, you could look around and get a mystery, drama, comical, or even a horror book. Having a wide range to select from would keep the guests always coming back for more. I know that when my library had a series of books that I found interesting that I was back in there after I finished each one.       Also, having different reading or viewing materials on hand is important in a library do to the fact that some books these days are now turned into films which makes people more eager to finish that book in less then a week so that weekend they can watch the movie. Most people say that the movies are never better then the original book itself but an opinion is easier to be based off of reading the book and then watching the movie not just by stopping after reading the book.      Now that you know my personal views about the censorship in libraries understand that not everyone is the same. That is why when school's talk about getting school uniforms many children are against it due to the fact of wearing whatever style of clothing you do each day show individuality such as which type of book your reading also, shows your individuality. That is why my personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to the fact that different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. Just because you @MONTH1 not believe in the magic or wizardry doesn't mean you have to ruin it for someone else. So don't jusdge a book by it's cover and lets not set a high standard on censorship in libraries.

I strongly disagree.I think that materials should don't  be removed from the library.@CAPS1 all the materials are part of the library and for the school and for us too.All the materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, cd's. should don't be removed from the library.I got my own reasons that materials should don't be remove from the shelf. like sometimes i don't found any interesting things to do, so i go to my tiny library that i got in my house and i pick any book that i like.But when i don't like or i don't find any interesting book in my house, i go to the library to find  some intresting  books.But when the libraries or the school got offensive books, magazines, movies, ect., i think that offensive stuff shoul be remove from the library,@CAPS1 is not good for the children's, like when they want to read a book, like cartoon or animal book, and they don't find what they want they are going to get mad. And what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents right but some parent will.and they maybe are not going to came back again.I never experience something like this in my life @CAPS1 in my school and the library that i go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated. that's why a respect the people for the library and for the school, @CAPS1 they respec us too. tha's why i never go to places that i don't know.Supose i go to a library that i don't know and i bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me, they are going to said that if i don't have respec, and that i bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me, that i bring my family to a offensive place, and is not my foul right.And those are my opinions why

No, i do not think that books, magizines, movies and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magizines, movies, and music should be monitred by age. The reason why is because younger children sould not be reading , listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers.       They way these type of things can be monitred is by the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth. If there is a certain book, magizine, movie, and music that the child want a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librian knows that the parent  is of age.           Teenagers should also be moniterd. Event though they are almost adults. Some parents @MONTH1 not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards.     Even though there are plenty of opinions about what a persons child is reading , watching, or listening to I think there should be certain ways to watch what children are reading, watching or listening to

Picture yourself walking through the library with your child. Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song.      I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as '@CAPS1' do not reach their shelves.     Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think?     In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment.

I feel as we are letting kids these days do as they feel, and do what ever they want. We are making them think that we don't care what they are involved in, but thats not true. We need to set boundries for what kids should and shouldn't be able to do. We need to show them that we know what they doing.     I think that there should be an age policy for libraries. If there are any books that have any types of adult content, they should be in the adult section. If you ever wanted to check out books, movies, or magazines from that section you would have to be eighteen or older. If that was to much to ask for then you should at least have the parents sign a concent form.      Book, movies, and magiznes with any type of adult content can be harzardess to child, whether its through their actions or behaviors. It @MONTH1 effect their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things. We need to show them that we care.     I know from personal experiences that being exposed to this, drasticly changes people, not over time but quickly. Now a days the media is portarying that money, alcohal, fame, and drugs are good things. This is what we are putting into our movies and books and magazines, and putting into the children of @CAPS1 heads. We are telling them that its ok, but its most certanly not.      These are all the reasons why we should put cencorships and restrictions on libraries. We are letting the children of @CAPS2 grow up to fast and introducing them to things way to early. In a way we are brain washing them on how to live a destructive live, through adult oriented things

The media is destroying our youth! this is something we hear everyday. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning.     If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.     Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more.      Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see.  If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see.     Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives. If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop. They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship

Censorship in libraries should not be a big deal. There are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people. To solve the problem, everything should not be censored. Why can't those that find it offensive just steer clear of it? I believe it should be a persons choice to read something or not and if they find it offensive, they should simply put it down.     The book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' has offended many people. I have read it and was not offended. I found it very interesting and educational. Many people think the book should be censored. But if it is censored, the story would completely change and it would not be the same. I would have learned nothing instead of learning how people lived in @LOCATION1's history.      If all the books and magazines that were offensive to one person were taken off the shelves, and all the books offensive to another taken away, what would be left? Little kids books about kittens? Well that's just lovely.     I am very much against censorship. I believe that if a material is offensive to you, then you shouldn't read it or listen to it. But don't ruin it for the rest of us

The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, available to anyone willing to take the time to engross themselves in the rows and rows of information. Including children's books, novels for young adults, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before. Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well. Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries.      I would like to being by saying that I have an extreme issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race. Imagine if an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 woman brought her daughter of @NUM1 years into the library to find information about a school project. Instead of finding the birth date of @PERSON1, she found a book making fun of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and calling them inappropriate names. Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found; not racial slurs. This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally. That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately!     Another issue I have is with sexual content being found in libraries. I do understand that several books contain some sort of sexual content, but I am speaking of a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost naked women on the cover. If someone is searching for a book of that kind, they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure. That type of book, however, should not be found in the library. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge.      Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries. Every human in the @LOCATION1 is entitled to their own choice of religion. They @MONTH1 practice it freely, which is sadly not the case for others in different countries. If we have an uncommom right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions. A @CAPS5 woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid. This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries!      Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship. Many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty. Yes, if we do not censor within certain limits, this could happen. This is not what I want to happen though. I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain. The least we can do, as parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries
<START>

Two of the many privaleges that we have as @CAPS1 are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work @MONTH1 be percieved as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others @MONTH1 not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity.     These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs.     Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living.     I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ingorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that @MONTH1 be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, '@CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'.     By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If @CAPS2 works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you. This type of literature provides usefull information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of @DATE1 that it actually was how people should not be living.

Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine. Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves?     In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. I have to say that I agree with them. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible

Katherine Paterson stated this quote, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' @CAPS1 I agree . I feel that some of the books we have in our @ORGANIZATION1 libraries today just shouldn't be there. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give  students and young children the wrong impact on life or their envoirment around them.     Now days, what children see is sometime what they do, so if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it. @CAPS2 observation when i look at kids  in @CAPS2 community playing  is that they follow one another . When their playing tag and hide an go seek , So movies, books , music, and magazines play a big part on the way they behave.     @CAPS2 own experience with offensive books would be, there are books that are made by @PERSON3. In these books they use curel language, use wonmen bodyparts as symbols and many more rude things. @CAPS2 little sister came across one of these books, when she ask me about it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading, So the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book. For her to get any images out of her head that I felt she shound't have.     Another experience I've saw was with @CAPS2 little cousin @PERSON2. He was looking at a magazine out of @ORGANIZATION1 library. The magazine was offensive to wonmen. It was a play boy bunny magazine. Now I don't know if you ever heard of these magazine , but I think it is very wrong that they use wonmen bodys for men to view . I also feel that  those type of magazines should not be in a @ORGANIZATION1 library. I believe it gives children, mainly  young men the wrong thoughts about wonmen.     @CAPS2 overall thoughts on censorship in libraries, is that not eveyone is going to feel the same way I do . There are parents that allow their children to read, listen , and watch whatever they want. I'm here to say i don't feel that is the way to go about things , because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things . I hope you take with you, @CAPS2 personal experience with you and help you children read , listen , and watch age appropriate books , music , moives , and magazines

Do I think that certain materials such asd books, music, movies,magazines,etc., should be removed froom libraries, no, because people might need to know a certain information, certain lessons are taught in different sources, all sources are liabilities.     Now, you just @MONTH1 need certain information, and in those sources there are an unnumbered amount of lessons to learn. For example if were to go in a library an need a book on religion I would need a book or movie to teech me on that particular subject, or even sex I would need a magazine or move to watch to know new information.     There are different lessons taght in different aspects. For example some people learn by example, movies, music, and magzines. I it were to be me lokking for a source on music theory I might need one of those things to get what i need.     Finally, those things are liabillities. Don't get me wrong like we need them on a daily bases, but in a sense we sort of do. We use search engines for everything, everyday. so what do you think.     In conclusion i believe we need those sources because, someone @MONTH1 need certain information, there are diffferent lessons learned and taught in different things, a lastly ALL sources are liabillities

The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not good thing to do. My view on the subject is that, if this begins there will only empty shelfs in librarys across the country. Once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left.     We use books everyday, for students we use them to learn and for a entertainment during someclasses. Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about. Even as adults some of them like to read in there free time.     I think its wrong to remove a book off of the shelf, just because a few or a bunch of people think its inaproprate. If it is the librarys should have section for those books that dont let the little kids go in that section. their is a problem for this idea, what books should go into this section of the library? A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to to remove or put into a speacial section in the librarys across the nation. This idea goes the same for everything found at a library.     Another soulution to this matter is that, the librarys across the nation have another labeling system like the dewey decimal system but use both. this new system could contain information like reviews from crtics about the book, or what happend during the book. This would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so.     The books, music, magazines found in librarys should be left their for a reason. Sombody wrote, or composed for a reason. so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music
<START>

Libraries should never remove any material just because it @MONTH1 be found offensive.  Something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another.  If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place.       People often get offended if they read, see, or listen to something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion.  But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values.  Though peoples' opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person.     So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions.  As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored.  I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to.  But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogoratory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things.       In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it.  But do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them
<START>

I dont believe books should be takin off of the shelves for being offensive. Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another. People @MONTH1 have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel, but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book. I understand that parents want to protect children. Parents should talk to their children and explain to them why they dont want them reading that specific book. Parents might also just let their children read it and explain why they don't approve.      I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies. When I was twelve years old i started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played. My mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to. She refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it. I went to my friends houses and listed to explicit music and watched rated @CAPS1 movies. She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went.     I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision. I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child. Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away. That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable
<START>

Many people go to libraries; such as children, parents, and grandparents. I have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community loving place is to find peace and quiet. Some don't even go there for the books. They will engage in music, magazine, enjoy a cup of coffee, or simply get on the internet. Now some people argue that some of the books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does that mean the libraries should have to get rid of them?     These materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned. First of all, the libraries will lose customers. There is a majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or @CAPS1&@CAPS2. It's hard to find that kind of music without cuss words or sexual inuendo. Even I will listen to that type of stuff occasionally just so that I can have a cool beat stuck in my head for a while. Plus, when you are in a library and listening to music you will have head phones on, which isn't disruptive to other in or around the library.     Secondly, customers who don't like the context of these materials don't have to get them. If there is a book that has a sex scene or talks about drugs then don't read it. You have a choice to what book you would like to read and if that isn't your style then there are plenty of other aisles and children books you can look through. Those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books. I have been to my public library many atimes and all the times I have been there I have not once even seen a book, music, or a movie that looks displeasing to the eyes. So if you're a person who wants an offensive book, then it takes A @CAPS3 of looking, not just a quick little scan.     Finally, freedom. Isn't that was @CAPS4 is all about? The freedom of speech, and religion, and even what type of movies you want to watch. I know this might come as a shocker, but there are labels on the back of movies that tell whether it is @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, or @CAPS1. It also includes the not-so-nice content that will be present in the movie. So you have total freedom to purchase(check out) any of those rated movies. Like I explained clearly earlier, you aren't forced to watch any of the naughtier movies, so just pick what you want and be happy.      As you can see, there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies. There are many different types and styles of these categories and it isn't disturbing anyone. Libraries will lose customers, people dont have to choose the less appropriate things, and us @CAPS7 have freedom to do what we please, especially with what we would like to read, listen to, or watch. So save youself some time and just keep the few so called 'offensive' materials.

There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed.       Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done.     Some people find some offensive subjects interesting. For example, if someone found the @PERSON1 interesting they @MONTH1 want to just do some research to learn more about it. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects.     There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive. If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job.      I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removings books, magazines, music, etc. I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else

I think that if there are books, music @CAPS1, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar.           I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions. The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vuglar movies, books, music and magazines then they should come off the shelf.  Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things.     They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them. For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books. The kids can look at this stuff and see violence. For example they can see pictures of  men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example.     We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to. It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing. The library is a place where many people go to learn. It is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them
<START>

Going into a  @CAPS1 everyone has there own opinons as to what they should see on the shelfs, and what should be put out on the shelfs for everyone to see including children of all ages. Some people @MONTH1 agree that there should only be thnigs that is age appropiate for everyone, others disagree.           In my opinion when im looking at this topic, i think that there should be books for everyone to read no matter what the age group, but there should also be a kid section. If parents are so concernced about what types of books their children might see at a library then they could just put them in the children section to view those. There is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety types of books out.          When it comes to looking at magazines, movies, and music i still have the same opinion to a certain aspect. There should be able to be all types of music out on the shelfs, because its not like people can listen to it by looking at the @CAPS2. But my opinion on the magazines, and movies could vary. There is a certain extant for movies, and magazines. I think they should all be aloud on the shelfs, minus any pornography.           The reason i think like this is because, kids should not have that big of an affect on what they place on the shelfs at a library. Parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at , and pay attention to them. But when it does come to the pornography that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library. There is some where to draw the line, in any situation and thats where i think it should be drawn at a library.

All libraries are not good cause some people are going to library an getting on the computer getting on websit that the child find. The people need the computer for appicatetionfor job an the owner be wanting to get a card .That is uncause for in some term. Out of all kides canlearn from the library an do there work if need it's so much they can do that they can be there all week.      All people from littler children to adult can still learn now today in the @NUM1 centrey . You can learn about your ancienty or about car crash or about or thing that are going on it the world . As like japaness or chin ,you can do so much from the library or from the books thats there.It's up to the family to get to know more about themself by the library .

There are more than six billion people in the world. That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinons of all these distinct people. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but its likely that its something that the author feels passionate about and the author could be offended if his opinon was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world. Media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view. It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media.     There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about. It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically.      This is a very two-sided subject. It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them, and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before and just remvoing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited.      Libraries are already decreasing severly in their reveleance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them and its not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other reasources, like the internet, again.With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinon and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves.

What is offensive to you? See your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you. There are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive. The world wouldnt be any different if we were to pull all of these offensive materials off the shelves. There wouldnt be anything left because everyone has their own opinion about something and everyone has different inferences about what's offesive to them. I believe that offensive material shouldn't be removed from the shelve.       Everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf. There is always something wrong with something. @CAPS1 might be the way someone has said something or the way they mean't @CAPS1 by. There is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say. Either they take @CAPS1 the wrong way or they just think @CAPS1's wrong.      Everyone has their own opinon about everything. Same for when some one asks you whats offensive to you. Someone else @MONTH1 say that what you find offensive, is no where near offensive to them. For instance, my grandpa loves all type of music and his life revolves aroud music. My grandma doesnt like some of his music because she says ' @CAPS1 doesn't sit right with me,' meaning that she doesn't believe in some things that the music is trying to persuade people to do. My grandpa really doesn't pay attention to the lyrics as much as my grandma does, because he doesn't see music in that kind of way. My grandpa likes a lot of music because of their rhythm and beat. They always kind of get into disagreements about music they want to listen to because my grandma finds something in the music thats offensive to her beliefs, but my grandpa doesn't. @CAPS1 doesnt effect him as much as her.     If you were to go around and ask people whats offensive to them, their would be some many different answers and you could never sum @CAPS1 all down to one answer. With only a couple of people feeling offensive to some things, but the majority find @CAPS1 different, that would ruin @CAPS1 for everyone almost. Then that would almost be everything gone cause @CAPS1's always that one person that takes @CAPS1 the wrong way and has to feel offended. So I still believe that offensive materials shouldn't be pulled off shelves.

I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that @MONTH1 offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that @MONTH1 hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controvercial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) @MONTH1 make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage.     To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is apropriate for, and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did.     As a newpaper company, you obviously know about our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. We, as @CAPS3, have @CAPS2. One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of press. With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue. I know, that from personal experience, when someone tries to take away my @CAPS2 that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves. By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that that would be repressing their @CAPS2 as @CAPS3. I know that if I were an author, and my book were taken off the shelf, because someone found it 'inapppropriate' I would be very upset. Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike, to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them.      However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully, and also allows readers to know what controvercial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning. I would strongly advise you consider my proposal, because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public.

Why @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some? A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that @CAPS2 doesn't even concern. So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay? Katherine Paterson made a statement and a part out of @CAPS2 said ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work that I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS3, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, ect. For example I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a disney magazine and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines. To me this is an image of selling sex. What parent would want there child learning about sex at a young age?      Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music. A lot of the music today is also sellling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages. Music such as hip hop, and rap, is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame causse they are only creatimg what people want and what is selling.     Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive. They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music.They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to majority of the society today. So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material?      In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries. But I dont think @CAPS2 would do any good, cause people will just find another source to get @CAPS2. Like Katherine said @CAPS2 won't be any books left if its all taken off

I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful.     There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarassing. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'.      Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There @MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody @MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman @MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion. What is offensive to some, @MONTH1 not be offensive to others.     I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it @MONTH1 be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world.

Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? The question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves. I don't think they should.     I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. You can make that desicion. No one is making you watch or read any of that.     I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I choose to read them. No one forced the act on me.     Some of you @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature.     There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be bare.     You have a choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves.

Libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent.Some people like reading books about war and violence while others find it offencive. No matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive? They shouldn't! Every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. If all the books that were offencive to someone where takin off the shelf, there would be no more books left.     People walk into the library and most of the time books are labled by what they are about. They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normaly don't go to the section that they don't like. There is no reason to go to the section that they dont like becasue they wont be reading a book from there becasue they dont like it. They would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books. People have the choice to read a book or not so why bother even worry what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what thye have. If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book that is their buisness but other parents might want their child to soo what all is out there and develope their child's views on subjects.     Everyone has different views and ideas. If every one was the same the world would be boring and there would be notheing to talk about. By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music there is always somthing to talk about becasue not everyone knows the same subjects. Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to what differences there are in the world. Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are so if the books are not there for children to try and read they will never know what they like and do not like. A book a child likes @MONTH1 not be that a nother child likes or even an adult likes but that is normal, people are not the same.      If everyone took the books or music off the self that they found offensive there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves. Styles are most the time oppisits, like comedy and sad books. Most poeple who would like comedy wouldn't like sad and visa-versa there fore they would take the other off the shelf so neither would have anything to read or listen to. Even with some of the best selling books poeple wonder why or how so many sold but thats just how it is. People out there like the book so if one person didnt like it all those people would never have known what that book is about and @MONTH1 have changed their life. Books can be very impactfull in people's lives and if they never read that book the change would never have been made to their life.The world goes round becasue of differences and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas. everyone cannot be the same it just would not work.      Libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it. People have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting. Moreover, if everyone tooks books and music off the shelves they did not like there would not be very many books and music left. So if you run into a book or some music you dont like just ignore it, dont read it or listen to it. Things will be much simpler in the long run.

Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished.     In this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. The will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around. It's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there.     Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship. It @MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener. On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless.        In my experence I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images.     Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things @MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating and music @CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves. The first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world.

There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there. From books about racism, violence, or pornagraphy I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library.     A library in a school is a great way to help sudents with projects, essays, or just to read. If my child was in elementry or even middle school , I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world. They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornagraphy, in which the library is better place to find a book then the interent that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it easier to work on projects.      Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be excellent to help them find out some tips. Magazines can also have some inaproprate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a ton of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library.     In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library. For young children, stay with the cartoon educational type things. For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it. If something offends you, go have a talk with the libraian they woukd probably be happy to take it off the shelf.

Books can be good things, but are they always good? They teach us things, entertain us, and are sometimes good pillows, but they can also be bad things. When a book is inappropriate for the reader, then it should not be on the shelves of the library. Music is the same way.     The library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive in religious ways. A person @MONTH1 believe in something very strongly, and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some way. Some @MONTH1 say that the person just shouldn't read the book, but if it were me, I would want the book gone so it didn't remind me of what it had said everytime I walked by it.      Books @MONTH1 even be inappropriate for little kids. It @MONTH1 have language in it that the parents don't like. People have said that they should just make a section for those books to where little kids can't get to them, but you don't know what the childs parents are like. they could think a word is bad when you think it's fine. Everyone is different. Furthermore, a book @MONTH1 contain images not suitable for children. It comes back to what I was saying before, you can't just make a section for these books and say the heck with it. Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books.     Some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music. I know from experience that my mother thinks that scream-o is the devils music. She says that it is not right for them to sing like that and that @CAPS1 wouldn't like it. Other peoples parents @MONTH1 feel the same way.     Magazines @MONTH1 also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way. Although I don't believe libraries should remove them, but they should still watch who reads them. They could even put a little label on the front cover of the magazine that says it @MONTH1 not be suitable for everyone.     Books are usually good things, although they can be very bad. In the end, libraries should consider censoring their books, or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints, take it off the shelves completely

Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too ? Your cousin believing in one thing,means you have to believe in it also? No,not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate.      Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere;in stores , in schools, inside, outside , they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about,that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it,well I say we don't.      Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended? What if something you liked ,was of an offence to another , does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion.      I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one,it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they @MONTH1 see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong.      Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like,that is another person , anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us,so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel? We @MONTH1 not all agree with their way of life, we @MONTH1 not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another,so why should an item?      A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate,but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate,especially in the world we live in today.     If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile , and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like , and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives,have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too.      So just because I agree with everything I said , are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not,but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we @MONTH1 not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have. Accept the world as it is,because it is what you live in and it is what you have,because with out it nothing would be anything.Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things

offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. people live around offensivness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class.     Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in @PERSON1's novel To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 by @PERSON1 using terms that are offensive to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it.     People live around offensivness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they @MONTH1 hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanties in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profain language and behavior when they go to school and work around ither childern who might have offensive behaviors.      Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rents a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson.     Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. first of all trying to censor a novel might abscure the message or theme. secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research. If all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read

Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it?     Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things.     Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent.      Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libaries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child.

Brian @PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 @NUM2                                    Censorship in Libraries          Should there be censorship in Libraries? If this is a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library no, but if it is a @ORGANIZATION1 library, yes. I am going to tell you what I think about the books, movies and magazines.          First I'm going to tell you about the books. I think the books in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty. Then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say. I don't think they should matter if its a nasty love book or a @CAPS2 @PERSON2 book, all that matter is that they are reading. War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be. Now in a @ORGANIZATION1 library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs. I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth, but keep it at a bare minimum.           Next  I'll talk about the movies they should have avalible in the library. I don't think anything over @NUM3 at a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level. Exept like sex ed tapes and history movies, no free days in class, its got to be @NUM3. In @ORGANIZATION1 I it should be @CAPS3-@CAPS4 movies. In those grade they really dont watch educational films it's all for fun films, so theres no reson for there to be anything worse than @CAPS3-@CAPS4.          Last I'm going to tell you about magazines. In @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I don't think the magazines are a big issue. Just as long as theres not @CAPS7 and stuff like that. At the @ORGANIZATION1 leave again I think they should be, kids that age shouldn't be reading @ORGANIZATION2. They just need to have learning and for fun magazines.          Should there be censorship in libraries? No at the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level and yes at the @ORGANIZATION1 level. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 leave the book shouldn't @ORGANIZATION1 they should, should in both @ORGANIZATION1 movies, and magazines shouldn't in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and should in @ORGANIZATION1.

To begin with I feel everyone should admire the libraries. I feel this way because at one point of time we didnt even have books let alone libraries to get books from. A library is a place that has a peacful and calm environment. People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music and aslo to relax.    So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the selves at the library if found offensive?' @CAPS1, I believe if things are on the shelf that @MONTH1 come off offensive to people they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment were things are offending you. If things seem to come off offending, it will make indivuals stop coming to the library. This will make the library loose alot of business due to lack of service.    The library should be a place that consist of love, peace and harmony. It should be a place were people should feel free and relieved from any stress. By seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library. This also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be. They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library.  Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music shouldnt be found in a library. An  example of some offensive music is the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music, meaning the music with all types of different profanity. The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner. Also the music that's making it seem cool to be violent.    This will come off offensive to many men and women. Think about it who wants to listen to music thats makes women feel like their not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting and gangs etc. People whould like to hear more soothing and relaxing music. The music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in. The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied.  In conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax. It should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed. This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is

Some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things on library. People might think that some of the material might be offensive of bad for the youth of the people who go to libraries.People might think it @MONTH1 be better to take the bad and offensive item off the shelf. I have a different opion on the subject. I don't think anything should be censored in the library no matter if it deal with book, movies, music, magazines, ect.,     The real question is why should this material be censored removed. The answer to that question is that it should not be sensored  removed. The library is somewhere you can go to get information on just about anything you want. If these items are censored or taken off the shelfs the resources would be limited and or no help to the people searching for the information. Another big problem with censoring or removint these materials is people might be missing out on alot of knowleged that they have never herd of that might be bad or offensive. Such as slavery, the @CAPS1 taking over the @CAPS2, and a lot of our world history. I feel strongly about people knowing about the worlds past.     Now what happens if the items are removed from the shelfs of libraries. what are you going to do with the thousands of books that you can no longer read because it is offensive. We just can't get rid of them just like that. A lot of the offensive stuff is true or based on a true story such as @ORGANIZATION1 park getting arrested because she refused to give up a seat to a white person. so removing these books would be pointless because where ever you put them people will just go there to get the material they want to know about.      The most important thing about this is who want these books censored or gone and why they want to remove them. Okay some book are bad and offensive but you have to look at it this way. People have there own choice on what they want to read , watch,or listen to. So just because some people dont like the material in a library doesn't mean everyone else doesn't like it. It the peoples choice not a opion on what a couple people say.     So at the end i think that books and other items in a library sould not be censored or taken off the shelfs. I believe that people have the right to read, listen, or watch what ever they want. I see it as people opions fighting opions on removing the books. Also if people don't like the book at the library then no one told them thay have to go meaning their opion really doesn't matter

Okay, to me, people are way to moral in the modern world, i was taught that if you have a problem keep it to yourself. Most of everyone know that censorship is a big deal but it doesnt have to be. I know that somethings are a little, risque, but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution. Your probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a 'better solution'? Lets talk about children and this content, if you get this out there quicker and subtlely, the children wont see the need to find out what it is at a later age. If that was to happen the conseqences could be fatal, such as; fines, misdemenors, respect, reputation, and even some time in jail. Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general, they are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older. Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community, yea i know what your thinking, why not do that? If more people in your community are nicer, when a real threat comes, whos gonna help? The @CAPS1? who knows, it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around, even longer if your in a city. In that time, some one could have died, been robbed and that same criminal gone. So, if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on, people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be benifical. Anyways, what im trying to say is, if you take this away from us, people will become weaker, if you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good

Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young.     Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence. If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it. When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young.     Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of. Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not. If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong! It is a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying.      Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language. They also should not be watcing anything about violence. Lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying

Some books in libraries offend others. So should they be removed? That is the point im going to get across today. Keeping people under self-control is top priorities for the public. So why do they keep releasing and publishing books if it offends certain groups?     Graphic and gorey books are books usually that disgust people but should all contain a warning symbol on it for people with weak stomachs and those who just can't handle it. So by that means, I'm fine with it. People need to accept that the world is not all sunshine and rainbows and that gruesome stuff is out there. This is my take on the whole situation. So people, if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.     However offense material to races, religions, and other personal aquisitions, is something of different concerns. This can certainly inflame groups, and even start protest or boycotting it. Authors in some cases need to review their materialand make sure it won't cause any disruption. Inflaming the public is not what you want young authors. This can not only make the public upset, but can possibly lead to the author getting fired.      False statement or inaccurate statements in books can lead to public curiosity and even conspiracy. Not only will it cause a stir up in the press, but just like the race/religion thing, it can cause the author to be fired.  This is not what the author wants. So making sure the work is true and not hipotheticle is a good step. These are great steps to achieving a positive step to public influence.     So inconclusion, authors have lots on their hands. All the way from race issues, religion, fale statements, and so on. These are some of the things authors want to avoid. Making the public recommend the book, and it having positive outcome on the press is the best an author can ask for
<START>

In libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer. There is no appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should be undetermined as to what makes a book offensive.      In a public library, many children, who the books are censored for, are with their parents. Parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read. Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous. If an author spent time creating a story, it should be appreciated, and should not put on a list of no-nos. If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation, all they have to do is not read it. Even in school systems, librarians are there to guide kids to read good books. If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it.     In my experience, I wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me, but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book. Some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas are exploited to them everyday on television and internet. So trying to shield your child from the bad things @MONTH1 be a great thing, but the efforts are usually failed attempts. It also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read. The libraries, for some, are the main means for getting books.     To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves. Many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it. If a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up.

Honestly there's alot of books and magagives that need to be taking off the self. I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me wha weed was it told me how to grow it! Also alot of book refer to drug and sex now a days and  absolutly hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it is been a while sence ive checked one out, had enough referances to sex that i could honestly say I thought I was read a porn magazine.     Our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs. I mean come on sixth graders shouldnt even be able know what weed is! Let alone read about it in school! maybe that why kids get interested in drugs and achole at such an early age. The book I read didnt have any negative satments about the weed. what makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs?     Like I said before alot of book in schools and pubic librarys have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you. And were you can buy the crap to make them!     Ok I know im in highschool but you should have book that seem like pron magazines. The book i read have pictures of postions in it! it broke everything down into details! It even gave websites on the back of the book. And that my friends is not alright. Its just sad.     It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I dont want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail. Let alont them reading about it at all. just take the books off the schools and pubic librarys selfs. Hardly anyone will read them anyway. And if they do its by accident like mine incounters where

I think that removing books from a library that are offensive shouldn't be allowed, first off because people have different taste on the books they read. I also think that the books that the libary carries are educational, they might be offensive to people but sometimes they are good for learning new things about the world around us. Another thing is that a lot of books, movies, music, and magazines might be offensive to you, but if you dont want your child to read those then just keep them away from those types of books at the library, and the people that do want to look at that stuff can. So i think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, everyone likes something different.      One reason why i think that libraries shouldn't be censored is because some people have different taste in the books they read. Some people like scary books, some people like romantic, so  everyone doesnt all like the same thing. Everyone might be offended of something but people should't let it bother them.      My second reason is because books that they carry at the library are usually educational. They have learner books for the little kids to help them learn how to read, they have magazines for the people that are interested in the drama around the world, then we have war books for the people that are interested in history, so i dont think that people should really be to offended by the books that people read.      Another reason is that if you dont want your child or a looking at the books or ect. That might look offensive to you then dont let them read them, everyone likes different things, and if you take away things that other people like then your just offendending them too. Thats why people that enjoy to go to the library should't take things so offensive, so we don't have to censor things at the library.     So thats why i think that libraries shouldn't have to be censored at all because people have different taste in the books that they read, that books that libraries carry are usually educational, and if you don't want your child looking at those kind of books then don't let them read them. People need to undrstand that some books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are they are just trying to state there own optinon

To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 @CAPS2:     @CAPS3 I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone. Anywhere I go I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself. People are people and everyone should be treated the same. It doesnt matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk. Everyone should be treated equaly. I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good. It doesnt matter what the past was like. The present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same.      I beleive that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are. If someone is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings. I think most people would agree @CAPS3 I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same. Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good. We do not need things like that in our world. That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs. Our world shouldn't concist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others. Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away. Inacent people do not deserve what people received in the past. The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present. Right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. I treat people the way I want to be treated and that should go for everyone. Harmful things need to be removed from everything. We do not need things like that in our world. People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are.     In conclusion I beleive that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. Everyone is who they are and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live. People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever. Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others. Everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care, not hatred.

Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just the few different types of books out there as well as the magazines and music we listen to. With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us but, some of the people that go there are not adults. Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with there parent/guardian. I believe that even though there are some books magazines, and music not attended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive.     Everyone once in their life had to atleast experience something unpleasant. But knowing our world today, we simply can not hide from those things but yet face them, we adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive unlike what our children or other children can do. Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well. It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us.      If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area. And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they @MONTH1 sit and read there favorite books as well with you by there side where you can watch there every move. And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see.      Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life. Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn there heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said. But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they @MONTH1 read and things they can't.     Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and @MONTH1 not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library. If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit and go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you an expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library
<START>

To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive i believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This book or music @MONTH1 be offensive but everyone is intitled to their own opinon. People have all the freedom to read, listen or watch anything that is approperite to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what @MONTH1 offend others.      Also from my own exprience i have read a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the stadges of our history where they were salves and were hung for their punishment. It @MONTH1 offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others @MONTH1 find it interesting to go back a learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are rascist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy. If you chose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that @MONTH1 offend someone then it shouldn't be removed, if you would like to read, watch or listen to anything that @MONTH1 offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it.        Therefore, i conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves. Everyone @MONTH1 have their own opinon or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries. It is for their own benifit, not for yours. It is up to you to decide wheather or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsable and have to removed anything open to the people that @MONTH1 just be part of our background

Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. Although censorship isnt usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over-used. Not everyone has the same views and morals, what @MONTH1 be considered appropriate for some people , @MONTH1 be viewed differently by other cultures or religions.       In my personal opinion if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it etc. Obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience. No one is forceing people to read or watch things, that is why there is something called viewers disgression. If everything that was considered offesive to a certain individual or group where censored , there would be no @LOCATION1. In @LOCATION1, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose. To censor things out is condraticary to that amendmant.    For example the censorship of useing the word '@CAPS1' in vain on television. I myself find this to be excessive because it doesnt apply to my beliefs . Although the program ' The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' protrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs. Even though I find this offensive and sterotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it.     I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television. Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for a one's children to be subjected to it,that is blowing censorship out of proportion. If you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it.
<START>

Censorship in libraries is not necassary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child

Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion no I don't think that any books should be banned from a public libaray.     The authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books @MONTH1 offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines. I think that if certain books get banned from the libaray then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will banned them as well.     In my personal opinion no I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library. The reason being is because you can't judge a book by it's cover. You don't know if the book is goin to offend you until you read it. After you read it or you'r in the middle of reading it and it offends you you should take it back to the library and get a new one.     Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion no I don't think that books should be banned from the public library. Because alot of books that do offend people are the one's that teach us about history.
<START>

IN MY OPINION I THINK THAT SOME BOOKS PROBABLY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF SOME OF THE BOOKS AREW FOUND OFFENSIVE. SOME OF THE MOVIES AND BOOKS PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE CAN BE PRETTY BAD AND SAY NASTY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.      SOME MUSIC CAN BE PRETTY OFFENSIVE TOO BECAUSE IT CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT ALL MUSIC IS BAD.. IT DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO IF IT SAYS NASTY THINGS BECAUSE THERE IS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TOO.
<START>

i believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. The reason why I say that is because of our first amenment which is freedom of speech we should be able to put anything in books, magazines,music,movies, and etc.. The other reason why we shouldn't take them off the shelf is because we should be able to tell if the book is good enough for your age or your viewings, depends on your point of views.     My first reason is the first amenment which is freedon of speech. The reason why I say that is because we should be able to but what ever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way shape or form. Also, if we start taking stuff away because of censorship in books it will go farther than that and it will come to a point where the first amenment will become cease.      In my culmination I have made my point that there shouldn't be any censorship in anything because of the first amenment. I also said the reason why we shouldn't have censorship is because it's another way to express yourself or your point of views.

You know when you find a @LOCATION1 book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind see. Or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word. I see it more better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them stuff like will make the child think that's how your suppose to act and talk. Here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines.     First, in deal with music children word immate act they see and the words the say. One good example is rap music: their song have cuss words in them and believe me when I tell you this that I have to constantly to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this. In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines.     Second, with magazine some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are ment to be seen where children read. an example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from magazine I found a magazine on the table and it show three of the cast members from @LOCATION1 in their birthday suits. I thought what in the world is this doing at my school they should have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud. What do they think it want bother any kids' parent about it that I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had a something that at there school.     In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them.

Freedom of press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown. To censorize the right to write freely about ones outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past.     Before todays technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to recieve one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information, they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone.      In the brilliant novel, @CAPS1 @NUM1 a man who lives in a distopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediatly taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and distruction as in the novel.      Having the right to know about your countries history or what is going on in your current government is critical in shools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf perminatly, there would be no more books. Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good.      Books are a history in themselves, no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavory or the possibility of a complete government take over. In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply chose a more ficition novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, however they can exagorate certain events and without the actual book or cite it came from, one could completely alter the publics view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it.      Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off ones talent is a privlage. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrevelent, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always strech the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people. The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades

The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time. Libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material. Children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to because it's their life. Books, magazines, music, and movies can teach young people about life and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard on entertaining the people..      The materials found 'offensive' should not be removed. These materials can be found helpful to others. Reading material can help a young person with life. If the reader is having problems and needs help, it is possible the book he/she is reading @MONTH1 help them in the thinking process on what they should do. The books, movies, and music have been made by extremely hard workers, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive.      One of the many times i went to the library I was looking for a book I had read before but I could not find it. I could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf. This hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read. Some books found 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read. Why take it off the shelf? People are being too much self-centered. They care about themself and that is it.      The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining. If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not the shelves. Freedom of the @CAPS1 states that the anybody has the right to write whatever the he/she wants to write.  If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves then we're going to get to the point to where there are no books on any shelf

I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelve do to something offensive.Libraries are a very important aspect to life for most people nowadays. Mainly because where I live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby.For, me and my friends the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home.The library has the internet and older books with information on the city.           Living in the society that we have now not every household can afford a computer with internet.Me myself living in one of those households.The library is a great quiet place to get your work done.Its also, provides the internet that people cant afford and need for everyday life.Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper ,but online.      Being a @NUM1 grade student we have to alot of projects to do that require old books on the city and history.If they remove certain books of the shelve i @MONTH1 not be able to find important information that I need.Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them ,however if everyone found something offensive in the book, movie or magazine does that mean it should be removed? If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books.    I have a friend who is mixed with mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive ,but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history.Proving that something that might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive and maybe very important to the other.           In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelve due to offensive content I believe is wrong.Every person is different and find different things offensive ,but things should not be taken away from another person who @MONTH1 need it

Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example rated-@CAPS1 movies, most children under @NUM1 cannot watch them. Either its a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people @MONTH1 find funny other people get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offened someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read.      Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for. For example, when my brother watched a rated-@CAPS1 movie. In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question '@CAPS3 do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happen to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give.     In this situation I am somewhat nuetral. I dont object to having things that might offened other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things and certain libraries @CAPS3 children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just @MONTH1 be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either.     The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries @MONTH1 not be a smart idea if it's @CAPS3 most children get there books. Parentscan always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children  to see or know of any sort of things that @MONTH1 be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library @CAPS3 a child might get ahold of it.     The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically  saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know. If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them.           Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves, if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials. Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing. If we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention?       In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention. Keep these items on the shelves!

The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group. Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive.     Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge. They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in.      With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. We cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries
<START>

I am a citizen of the @LOCATION1 and I believe that the censorship on the material in libraries is not good but it could be better. It should be an age limit on certain books and magazines ect. in the library. Somethings younger children shouldn't be able to read because of the maturity level. I remember taking my little sister to the public library and she got a book and began to ask me some words that she shouldn't even be hearing about now.      On the other hand, those books @MONTH1 be needed. Some people need those types of books and magezines for research papers and things like that. Now I consider myself a young adult and I believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong. Its also up to the parent or gaurdian of the child , if you feel that you dont want your child to read anything thats not appropriate then go with them to the library. But then some children dont have a mature parent or gardian that would tell them what to read and what not so thats when the library should do something about the censorship on the books.     Well I jus wanted to write you this because like I stated before the censorship on the books, movies, music, magazines, ect. in the library is ok but it could be jus a little better. There should be a certain age when a child reads or see's certain things. But you can't just take all the books and things out the library that are not appropriate because some people actually need the books. Thats why I believe that it would help if the library had a age limit or made certain things for mature audiance only.
<START>

If something is to be found offensive, than it should certainly be removed from the shelves. When parents send or take their children to a library, they do not expect their child to be able to pick up something that is not appropriate. Some items @MONTH1 offend someone's beliefs and be rude. Public libraries are just that, public. Everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people. No one should have to worry about being offended when they walk into a place of learning and knowledge.     Parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials. Even if the child does not check the book or magazine out, who is to stop that young, impressionable mind from flipping through the pages. Perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time. Books now have a lot of crude text and humor. If there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand, he or she @MONTH1 get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject.      If a kid is rumaging through the more adult section of the library, they might be expossed to some information they are not ready for. Offensive language @MONTH1 be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases. If a child read something about sex, he or she might be curious or confused, and ask their parents about it. The parents on the other hand, might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age. At that point there would be no turning back. Parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds.     Parents have every right to deny minors and children certain materials, but if the books are out in open, who will censor what is looked at by whom. Libraries need to put serious thought into what is on the shelves, no matter what form the information is in. People @MONTH1 think just because the story was in a book, than of course it can't be real. Some reckless senarios are played out in movies. Those movies are watched by people of all ages. If an impressionable teenager watches a movies that has offensive language or violent scenes, that teen might act upon what they've seen.     Since the public library is indeed public, the materials it offers to people should not be offensive. All sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around. No one should ever walk out a library with the feeling of being offended. No parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up. Libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way.
<START>

I feel that they shouldnt be removed due to the fact that somebody else @MONTH1 like that movie, book, music, or magazine. Just becuase we might not like it doesnt mean theirs somebodyout there that do. Everything shuld be in the library becuase their are different people and not everybody like the same things.      The library suppose to have everything so if we declared to take something off the shelf becuase due to the fact one or a couple more people dont like something or whats being displayed out to people it wouldnt be right. I have been to the library and looking for an movie or a book that i like or want to see and it have not been there i have got mad for that. So ifeel as if it's not right nor fair. Everybody should have their right to what ever it is that they read or like to watch.     Even though there are certain books or movies out their that chidren should not touch, i still feel as if they shouldnt remove anything off th shelves.

Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I'm here to talk about why I thing we should have these certain materials in the libraries.                       Why I think these materials should stay well because,  For @CAPS3 lets say its a certain movie or song or book or whatever just that one thing you were looking for, for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happening to go to the library just to look. Even though  you know its not there, but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you where looking for.             And what if you wanted to look for a myster book and only the library had that book you where looking for. I can think of alot of reasons why we need certain materials. well i guess that about sums that up for me.                 And in concultion put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay.
<START>

What is your opinion on reading materials? Should people be able to read what they want, or should we limit them to what they read? Every library has different choices. They can say you can't get this without an adult, or they can just let you check it out and take it home.     I have read many different things in my lifetime so far. I have read books that people have told me were not appropriate, and then nothing bad was in there. Most books even if they say one to two choice words it turns into an adult book. I think it should be up to the reader, if they can handle a book or not. Everyone reacts to things differently. Let's take people in my age group, for example, some of the boys are still immature, and think it is funny to act out. Those are the kind of people that cannot handle what we call 'adult' material books. Most girls are in the stage where they are maturing, still immature, but working their way up the scale. They would be able to handle something in the adult material category. The reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle.     If we take peoples choice away what are they going to have? You would make them feel more like they are being babysat because they have to take their parents to the library, and say hey mommy and daddy pick me out a book because I am not eighteen and cannot pick one. I would not like that. Being one that reads a lot I know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book. Therefore, i would not be able to read as much. I mean what do you think?      Which side would you choose? Everything is a personal opinion. It is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with. Do you want to decide for yourself or have some one with you every step of the way. Some people are just too busy to even try to fit it in their schdule to go to the library. Others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read. Why stop some one from getting smarter? A child will only learn more by challenging themselves. Why not let them challenge themselves in a good book, that they got to pick out. What do you think
<START>

I believe that libraries shouldnt be censored becuase people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this becuase everyone takes offense to something, If people can't find what they're looking for then why go to the library, also everybody likes diffrent things. I'll support them in the following paragraphs.     Have you ever read or seen something that u took offense to you or others? normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them. If people where to take away things that offended them in librarys what would be left of the shelfs? dust? Becuase there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is diffrent. This is one reason I support no on censorship becuase there would be nothing left.     Also everyone tends to like many diffrent things. I @MONTH1 like something you could possibly hate, should it not be aloud in a library becuase you don't like it? No, becuase something you like could be taken away by someone else. So if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like this would be another thing were nothing would be left. I think that becuase if we combined everyones things that they hate, it would most likely be everything.     These two subjects bring me to my last reason, if people cant find what they want. Becuase it was taken away, why come to a library? People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet and librarys would become empty like there shelfs. Then it was a waste of money to make the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians. Thats wasted tax dallors we could have used for something better.     After reading all my reasons and opinions I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries. becuase everyone is offended by something, everyone likes diffrent things, and noone would use a library if what they liked wasn't there. some people @MONTH1 disagree with me becuase they're one of these people being offended or not liking something. But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what there for, allow people to read, research, adn watch what the want.

Censorship is one of the most broken laws in @LOCATION1.  It is illegal to censor any publication such as books, magazines, music or movies.  Censorship most often occurs with books in a school setting.  Censorship should no longer be tolerated because it affects the writers, school system and escpecially readers.       In the @ORGANIZATION1 every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to.  School systems are taking away that right by not allowing them to have a certain book in a school.  Schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all.  The faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals.  It is not fair to the writer to be descriminated agianst, and that writer must have the right to have their book read in any setting.       The next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself.  If a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment, then they might start taking away other rights.  In general school systems and teachers are power hugnry leaders of the student body of a school.  They make rules just to display their power over students, and take away many of their rights.  If schools are allowed to continue censoring books, then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored.  As Katherine Paterson once said,'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children...take off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove the book I abhor...then you have exactly the same right...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional.       The last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students.  Censoring a book is taking that persons ability to learn about, and understand a certain topic that was censored.  Students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals.       In conclusion, censorship in any setting, but escpecially in school must no longer be tolerated because it affects writers, school systems, and potential readers.  Schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers.  The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on the unlawful practices occuring in schools, around the country, everyday

What is this world coming to?  We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines.  The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth.  I strongly feel this disturing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries.          I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read.  I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking.  The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become.  I feel they will eventually let curiousity get the better of them.      Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up, but I disagree.  Trying any one of these harmful activites portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger.  It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs.         To better prove my point, think of your favorite book.  Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him/her?  Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model.  They @MONTH1 save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well.  This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite.     I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries.  This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth.  It leads them to believe everyone, including their heros in books and movies, does these things.  Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for
<START>

People think that graphic images or words are going to change the outlook there younger child has on alot of topics. But really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter? Well according to some people it does which i can understand but i will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to. Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so i say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, ect.     The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them. Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities, races, ect. When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious. Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it.     Through all of this you should know by now that i don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read. Casue like i already said there are gonna find out about this stuff eventually. So no need getting mad over it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books what  kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read. Casue im pretty sure i dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home.

Dear @CAPS1,      @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1. I am a student here at @LOCATION1, and it has come to @CAPS2 attention that the @ORGANIZATION1 is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library. I think this is wrong. If everybody at @LOCATION1 took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away, we would be left with no books to read.      I also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read. I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make @CAPS2 own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading. If I feel I should read books that others @MONTH1 find offensive then, why does that concern you? Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to.         Also, I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting. If you take every offensive word out of a book, chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it. If you take all offensive books from the library, kids will be even more discouraged about reading, and I know that is not what @LOCATION1 is looking to do.     If you think that books are that offensive, try walking down the hallways. this is a @ORGANIZATION1. Kids cuss all the time, and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I've ever read. If your looking to make children more innocent, then taking all ofour books out of the library is not the way to go about it
<START>

Every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience.  Unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it @MONTH1 not be something that they are supposed to be reading.  When an author writes a childrens book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult.  Also when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the authr is talking about and can act maturely while reading it.  Although some novels @MONTH1 not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not they way to fix that, and it is a big mistake.     As humans we are given certain freedoms, and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press.  Authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about.  If they choose to write about subject's that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries.  Even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are. If you take those books away because your scared that a child might get ahold of one, then your taking away what certain people enjoy reading.     Due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors.  They have a children's section made primarily for children,an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read and a teen section for everyone in between.  By having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books.  Having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it @MONTH1 be, and cutting out certain books all together.     If a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want.  If a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive.  Instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like.  If a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out.     Censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered.  Whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries
<START>

I think that all offensive materials should be removed from librarys so every one can read a book listen to music and watch movies with out being offended. They shuld have there own section for that kind of material.                                                     Movies that are bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a section just for those movies. The sction should be locked up so children can't get those movies. I think that this would be fair for everyone.      Music that is bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a section just for that kind of music. The section should be locked up so children can't get that kind of music. I think that this would be fair for everyone.      Magazines that are bad should be taken off the shelf. These magazines should have a section just for those magazines. They should be locked up. I Think that this would be fair for every one. Books that are bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a secton just for these books. these books should be locked up so children cant get them. I think that this would be fair for everyone.     This is what I think should be done with this offensive materials. If this was done everyone would have a book to read  a magazine to look at music to listen to and a movie to watch
<START>

Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.      Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general
<START>

'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views.     A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightnement. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on @CAPS5 but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? @CAPS1 goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another.      Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inapropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not aloud to roam the library without an adult. @CAPS1 is a very prominant rule because it sets boudaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults.      Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries beacuse they are found offensive becuase @CAPS1 is censorship and it takes away our rights.

I dont think we should not take books, Music, Movies, and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us. If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me.     Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like. One of them is @CAPS1 Books I hate them with all of my heart. The next kind of books that I think is offensive is @CAPS2 Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read. So I think that it is a wast of paper. The last kind of books I think is offensive is @CAPS3 Books because they are hard to read them in @CAPS3.     Their are lot's of music out there I dont like. One of them is @CAPS5. I dont know why I dislike @CAPS5 but I do. The next type @CAPS6- @CAPS7. The singer in todays @CAPS6- @CAPS7 I think are no good. The last type of music is some of todays rap. I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words.     Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like. The first one is @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I did not get the hole plut of that movie. The next one @CAPS12 of the corn. Their was no way I could find out way the @CAPS12 was killing the people over @NUM1 in that town. The last movie that I did not like was ALL the @CAPS13 movies. I just did not like them ok?     I think all of these things are offensive. But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away. There are thing people like but I dont like them. Their things that my friend like but I dont like. Their thing I like and they dont like. But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like. But you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world

Our founding fathers creating amendments for the people.  One of the greatest is the freedom of speech.  Censorship of offessive materials is unnecessary.  Books, music, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 have bad messages or nudity, but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them.  Book burning happened because of the dislike of people's writing.  People have the right to say how they feel by any medium.  Censorship of anything makes a child more immature.     Book burning is a horrible action by any person.  People used to burn them because of all the sex, drugs, and violence, but doing this destroys people's dreams, theories, and ideas.  In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, firemen would burn any book seen within a home.  Almost ever single book in the world is not factual, unless it is nonfiction.  The firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government.  That basically means every kind of book out there.  The causation of such a tragedy was that every citizen befriended their television or video games.  Without books there would be no real sort of entertainment.  Also, the things we read everyday are what make us who we are so there, in fact, should not be less books but more.     Libraries have no right to censor books.  Freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation.  Why should it change now?  Stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out.  They @MONTH1 have already written their ideas, but if nobody reads their work then there is no way that they'll be heard.  Libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids' ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs.     Parents have always stopped their precious babies from watching certain shows and movies.  I once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the @PERSON1 series because of the use of sorcery.  She believed that he would try to learn witchcraft.  I found that quite ridiculous when I heard about it.  When a kid watches murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with bits of nudity, it is different to them and they are curious.  After watching these kind of scenes, a parent needs to sit down with their child and talk about what they jus saw.  The child needs to know that killing is wrong and justice is good and magic and dragons don't exist.  Nudity has always been considered a bad thing but penises and boobs are part of the human body.  Kids will be more mature about it the more they see it, but that doesn't the child should watch porn.     Censory has always been taken the wrong way.  People believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about.  We should not get rid of the obscenity at all.  We should have an understanding of the bad things in life.  Burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind.  Freedom of speech is a law and should be followed.  Censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter

Should books, magazines, movies, and music be put in higher reaches of children, or should they be left in plain sight? Is @CAPS5 fair to not be capable to see a movie, magazine, or even read a book because others in the area believe @CAPS5's offensive in their view? If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel @CAPS5's only for their eyes to see @CAPS5 then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows, not anyone else.      Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The reason for this is because, @CAPS5's not fair to others who haven't read them, and who would like to read them, but can't because they have been removed to others oppinions. If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and releasr them to stands for them to be sold. If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track.     There are many chances for school projects that @MONTH1 require getting information, but the student who is assigned to get @CAPS5 is not able to, due to the fact that adults think the website @MONTH1 be inappropriate. For example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the @DATE2 about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for a grade. @DATE3 comes and he/she doesn't have @CAPS5 and gets a @CAPS4 for the homework he/she was assigned. The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information. He/she starts explaing themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked. The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out, or I wasn't able to check them out.' '@CAPS5's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive, and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves.'      The teacher then says, 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can, how does that sound to you?' '@CAPS6 good, at least @CAPS5's better then getting an @CAPS4 on the assignment,' said the student. @DATE1 @TIME1 comes, adn the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books, and hands @CAPS5 to the teacher. At the end of class @CAPS5 gets graded and the grade on @CAPS5 turns out to be a @CAPS8. Student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start.     This is why movies, books, magazines, or even music should not be removed from shelves. Things like this will probably happen, and the kids will land up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault. If only a few citizens have oppinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed, then they should be from their sight, and they shouldn't bother thinking of them. Even if @CAPS5's for safety of the children they @MONTH1 have in the house with them, then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of excpet for that one particular person.

Bad @CAPS1 in @DATE1's @CAPS2      Libraries are a great place to learn about many thing, from earths history to where will we be in the future. I think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people. Even movies and music can be offensive to some people. I think the music of @DATE1 is a big problem because the lyrics can be very offensive. Movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times.      There are many reasons movies can be offensive. If they are offensive why put them in the libraries? Well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products. For example a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie that is inaccurrate and poorly made might be offensive to real life @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 veterans. The veterans then might want the movie taken of the shelves. I have seen some great @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movies but I have also see some bad ones too. My grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and got so upset he cursed at the @CAPS15 and almost threw the remote at it.      Then ther is the problem with the music of @DATE1. I do not think stores including libraries should sell albums of @DATE1's rap artists because all the talk about is drugs, sex, and girls. If you ask me its stupid. But when you start selling them in a library there is something wrong with that librariy. Some country singers can be like that to because all the sing about is getting drunk then having sex. I just think the most of the music of @DATE1 is really pointless and a waste of time because when I listen to it I think this is stupid and makes no sinces.     Books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer. Books with a lot of cursing can be offensive to religions groups who are forbidden to curse or read curse words. Why put it on the shelves of libraries then? Well it all lead back to money. If people buy the books that mean the libraries get money and the more books people buy the richer the libraries becomes. I read a book that was about some one killing cats and I found that offensive because I love cats I would never hurt them. I got really mad when I read it so I threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them.     So over all the libraries should be more carefull on what they put on the shelves for people to buy. If the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit. But if they do not put offensive things on the shelves they will not end up being in a law suit

I do believe that some places have magizines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from all shelfs. Just think, if you had childern would you want them getting ahold of a magizine with nude men or women in it. Yes people tell you they have control of there kids in stores, but i know you see kids all the time walking away or roming off to try to do what they want, and go to places they shouldnt be like magizines for instence. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magizine with nude wemon in it? Thats not the things kids should be finding in stores, its not nessacary.     Same deal goes with movies, say you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it, do want that around your kids? i know i wouldnt, cause kids are like monkeys, monkey see monkey do, and you dont want your little one walking aroud cussing at you. I have little cousins and ive seen it happen many times where they cuss back at there parents, and when the parents ask them where they heard that its usually the same answer, tv or movies.      So do you really think it's nessacary to have all that bad stuff around for anyone, of many ages to see? It's not. Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelf and destoryed, cause I shouldnt have to see it and niether should anyone else, its gross, nasty, and inrepropriet to childern. I say get read of it all and do everyone a favor

Libraries contain many different selections of books, music, and magazines. However, are all of these materials appropriate for all @CAPS1 visitors? In this essay I will explain to you why I think offensive, distracting and inappropraite material should be removed off of the shelves, and put into their own section of public @CAPS2.     If a small child were to walk into a public @CAPS1 and pick up a book about abortions, they would not know what the book is talking about, because most small children cannot read. What if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up? They would be able to read  the whole thing with no problems. However, should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age? I dont think so, fifth graders should be reading age appropriate books. This is just one reason why I think offensive, distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the @CAPS1.     When I think of a @CAPS1 I think of a quiet place that I can go to and read, or study. Although, some Libraries allow their visitors to listen to music. Rather it be on a computer, on a ipod, or even on a cell phone, there should be a sound limit right? Most people would think that Libraries set sound limits, and they probably do, but people do not follow directions and they are not attentive to what other people are doing. It is @CAPS6 distracting to go into a @CAPS1, to study, and the person next to you has their ipod blasted to a heavy metal rock song. Once again, this is another reason I think offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be moved to its own area of the @CAPS1.     I also think that a @CAPS1 is a community place, that you can go to and be safe, and your parents would not have to go with you because they think that it is safe and appropriate too. Most Libraries have magazines, because its for your entertainment, and they want to keep you happy so you will keep coming back. Well not all magazines are rated @CAPS10, some have @CAPS6 inappropriate material in them. A child should be looking at magazines that are appropriate for children, a teenager should be looking at magazines that are for teenagers, and an adult should be looking at magazines for adults. However the adult magazines should not be showing people with barely any clothes on, or any sexual scenes, and neither should teenage magazines. With innapropriate magazines, I do not think they should have their own section of the @CAPS1, I think they should be removed all together. They have pictures in them and anyone can look at a picture.     I really hope you can understand my point of view. It is nothing against public Libraries, it is just the material inside of them. If I owned a public @CAPS1, I would have rooms devoted to books that are for different age groups. For example, I would have a room for @NUM1+, and a room for @NUM2+. Those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children. I would also have my own room devoted for music only. That way anyone could go in the room and listen to whatever kind of music they want, no questions asked. The rest of the @CAPS1 would be for people to study, and read. I think every @CAPS1 should be like this, it would help make the world a better place

Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I think that books, newspapers, and magazines being censored should be done but shouldn't. When I say that I mean that some books dealing with adventure or romance might have parts that need to be censored, but thats how the author made the book. It was meant to catch your attention right off the first sentence of the story.      I believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the @LOCATION1 and other people around the world. Magazines in my opinion should be censored. Now some make it to where there less inaproperate which is somewhat a good thing, but others pretty much just let it slide and figure it will raise the sales by how ever much percent they want it to be considering what they put in the magazine.      I feel that books should stay on the shelf however. Some people feel that the 'censored' parts of the story are really what catches there attention. I myself have never had an expirence in this field because im not one to be a strong reader, but knowing how other people are, I would suggest that we censor some things, but not all.     People write books all the time dealing with something that has happened in their lifetime or something from their imagination. So we can't really help what people think about and what some people write down to be published in a book. For some readers, it is a very interesting story or passage being read from the back cover of the book, while others just want the book gone from there neighborhood library or out of their house. It all really depends on the reader.      If I could, there would be things I would censor, but not in books. It was their idea to put it in the story but some things need to be left unsaid. Some readers appriciate it, while others do not. It is really their choice to read the book and if its not appealing to them they can simply put it back on the shelf and find another close to it. I just feel that some magazines should be censored. Constantly, you see swimsuit models and 'sexual appeal' in magazines everyday when you enter the grocery store or library. I just do not think it is right for little kids to see that when there looking for a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 book or a book about their favorite animal.      Another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine. People everyday become @CAPS4 and being right with @CAPS5, so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines. I myself as a @CAPS6 take offense to some of these magazines, promoting being perfect and having the life sucked out of you as you read each passage.      As I have said, I am to the understanding of the books having what they have in them, because of the authors imagination, but some magazines just need to be thrown off the shelf

The way i see it movies or books shouldnt be taken off the shelf .becouse it should be up to ower own right to take a movie or to tonot take the movie .Also music such as country or sad music ant like movies or books how can u take music of the radio u canot do it .Becouse it dnt matter what u do with the radio shut it off turn it down or change the chanel with the way the world is now days there will all ways be things on the radio that u wont wanna hear and there will be things that u do wanna hear ,thats my opinion about movies and music      Also if there was any way to keep movies away i would probaly have it done there are goood movies and there are bad but one movie that is afensive and shy is (shylo) about the old man hittin the dog and stuff thats verry afensive to some one that was raised around beetings.

We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you?  Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material.      We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to.      I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me.     We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them.

Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you

Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict.     We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter @CAPS1 precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too yound to see them, like under the age of @NUM1. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though.     @ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occassional '@CAPS1 to wear this @DATE1!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. @ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon.     Say a child around the age of @NUM2 is listening to the new @CAPS2' @PERSON1 song. He is being introduces to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the @NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending @NUM4 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated.     I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconciously) do participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with @CAPS1 it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed.

The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropreate, another @MONTH1 find obscene and volgur. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, @MONTH1 insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person.     A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house.      To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public.      No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut-off as to how inapropreate or volgure something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, seperate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect.     Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves wouyld be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove.      A religious family that believes @PERSON2, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelfs of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose.      The graphic novels I find inapropreate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropreate, instead of the world.     Although not everything is appropreate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world. There are ways to cencor things to parts and not others. Nothing should be romoved from the library because of its content. At most it should be placed in a less accessable manner.

There are many diffrent people in this world, who have many diffrent oppions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc., @CAPS1 because one person dose not perticualy like horor movies, that dose not mean that movies stores should remove horor films from there shelves. as creepy as it @MONTH1 sound. there are many people in the world who are slasher film freeks. the live and breath scarry movies. I myself like @CAPS1 about eveything out there. i will read any book of listen to any type of music, it actualy widens my taste in certain materials. i feel like everyone should try new things. Say growing up your favorite books were @CAPS2 The @CAPS3. and you would like to shaire your childhood stories with your children. BUT @CAPS4, books stores took @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This is nonsince. many people like many diffrent things.there is no reason to only sell what you like. otherwise your busines will fail.

What is consitered offensive? If we took books, music, movies and magazines that people found offensive of shelfs there would be nothing left. Everyone is diffrent which mean they all get offended in diffrent ways. By taking all this off shelfs we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world.          Things we learn about in school, slavery, wars and some pollitics. Now all these things could offend many people but if we were to take them of off the shelfs at school and libraries children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alchol, many parents do not talk to their childern about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources they @MONTH1 never know the harm that they can do to someones body. Everyone takes something offensive but not everyone takes the same thing offensive. So who is to say what offends people and what does not? If thats the case shouldn't we take all books, movies, music and magazines away from childrens schools and libraries? Adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper. By taking away what one @MONTH1 call offensive @MONTH1 land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive.   Everyone has the right to read and write what they want. No one can say what offends everyone. Someone @MONTH1 get offended by talking about ones race, another @MONTH1 get offended by talking about @CAPS1 and someone @MONTH1 even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat. Everyone looks at everythings diffrently. So why try and control us all as one. All people think diffrent and they know what they want to read, hear and watch all by them selfs, they don't need someone to tell them.

Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, suchs as schools and tv shows intended for young children. Things that aren't intendend for young children should not be censored. If you were to censore everything because some people find it offensive then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community.     Censoring books, moives, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a wast of time. If you were to take a book off a shelf that explaind the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 because a person found it offensive then we would never make advansis in technology. Cenosoring items like books is just plane idiotic and ignorant. Studing matireal is our only way to advance in seiance, and if we can't get the right books to studie because they were taken off the shelf due to it being offensive then we will never make brakethoughs in technology.      Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really arent good parents. If they really were consurend with thouse topics then they shouldn't buy them the moives or the books that they find offensive. It seems that parents want to proclaim they want to censore that items because they find it offensive. But not all parents feel the same way, some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their chilren are mature enough to handle things like these.     As a child I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations. I grew up with out censoreship. I wacthed movies and read book that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all ment. I see why parents want to censore that kids from topics like thouse, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topic and see if that are mature enough to hanld it.     Censoreship is great for childrens tv shows. But when you start to censore someones ideas because you find them offensive and wrong then you are being ignorant. People here have freedom of speech and desirve the right to not have there work censored because a small group finds it offensive. Censoreship is a great tool, if used right

Book Censorship?          Should books be censored? This a national problem about the contents of books. It is a big deal. What one parent feels is very offensive another @MONTH1 feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn.     If you ask me thaqt question I would say, '@CAPS1 I believe the books should ,but to a national scale and not a community one.'@CAPS2 this I mean a book with things like references to nudity or other things of volgur nature ,not just because it has a bad word in it that a parent feels to be inappropiate for their child. I believe there should be a national rating system for books like there is in the movie industry.      Also i believe that it is the parents' job to regulate what their children read. If they believe the book is vulgar or inappropiate but the system don't then you need to prevent their children from reading it without taking it off the shelf. It is the parents' job to regulate the reading of their children not the contents of the bookshelf.     Like in Katherine Paterson's @CAPS3 ' All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 this I believe she means that if we all took a book of the shelves for our children there would be no books because what is not offensive to you @MONTH1 be very offensive to another parent. So the parents should leave it on the shelf and prevent their own kids from reading it and let the other parents worry about their own kids.     @CAPS1 I believe in a goverment censorship program but to an extent. It is the parents' job to regulate the readings of their children ,but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf

No, I would not think it would be the right thing to do. To just take a book off the shelf just because one person or a small amount of people think that one book is offensive to them. Its not only one person to decide that. People or some people would like to vote or have a meeting about taking a book or books off the shelf cause it's offensive to them.Just because one person finds that book or books offensive doesn't mean that they should have the right to just throw the book away. Thier could be many people out thier that really like that book or those books, and they wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore. All because one person or a few other people don't like the book.Yes their are books out thier that a lot of people don't like but that still don't give one person to throw the book out, all because they don't like that book or that seires of a book. No one should have the right to just take a book that they don't like out of a libary and throw it out because they don't like it. Their could be a smart little boy or girl that likes that book and because that one person threw it away because they don't like it, now that little boy or girl won't get to read their favorite book. Thats why I don't think books that some one thinks is offensive should be taken out of a libary. Because theirs always some one out their that likes that one book that you might want to throw away. If you think the book is that offensive to you just stay away from that area of the libary and don't think about that book

The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others. Whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many peoples point of views it shouldn't be available to the public.       I personally beleive that if something is seen as volgure and offence it shouldnt be displayed. Millions of people will be viewing this and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it. Why would anyone else want the opposite? Kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child. We all want to bring our kids up right and letting them have availabilty to negative material is uncalled for.  Its not only kids either that are affected, adults also are affected by the media. Adults can get fooled too, beleive me.      I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason. I beleive that what the librarians did was right. Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things. Some students @MONTH1 not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student.      I beleive that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough I stand for whoever it is that did it. Nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child. There should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities

I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @NUM1 to @NUM2, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of.          When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life.                So thats what my person input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.

Books have been apart of every single person's life as soon as they learn to read. First our parents read us books to get us to go to sleep. Then our teachers read us books to teach us things or to keep us preoccupied. Then, when we get a little older, we are assigned to read books for classes. There is even reading in the workplace, whether it be reciepts or orders or recipes. Readings is something that we cannot get away from. This leads me to say that authors write books for an audience and write the book as best they can to atrract the attention of the audience. I do not believe that books, regardless if one person deems them offensive, should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on. I think that there are things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book. There are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive. Also there are advantages to reading books that @MONTH1 show something different that that person @MONTH1 have experienced before.     First, I feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive. Everyone has an opinion and just because one person does not like the book, should not mean that the experience of reading that book should be taken away from someone else. If you find a book to be offensive, you can simply stop reading the book. Just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not also. That is just apart of humans having their own opinions.     On a different note, I think that childrens' books are a little bit different. Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children. I believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children. For young children, I think that parents should just read the book first and judge whether or not they think they're child should read it. Then for young adults, I think that parents could try to look up somethings about the book. The internet is a great source for reviews and ratings of books. Therefore, I believe that censorship for childrens' books is a responsibilty of the parent.     Lastly, I think books that are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently. When I read a book, think about the scheme, imagine the characters, and react to the events, I come up with my own opinion of the book. My friend, who is also reading the same book, could form a completely different opinon of the book. But we both gained something by reading the book.      In conclusion, I think that books should be censored by parents and that is it. I think that reading books is a very positive thing. So no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read. Also, books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about. It is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf.
<START>

I believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive. Many people have there own taste in what they like to read, write and do. Therefore, there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelfs so people can do what they enjoy best.     Books and magazines @MONTH1 be offensive, but they @MONTH1 also entice the reader. i personally love books about drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things. In fact my favorite book is banned from my school library. If they took all inappropriate books out of they library. What would i read? not everything can be just peachy kin all the time. Its not in real life, so why should we have to read a little fantasy world that we know isnt true? I know i would'nt want to read that.      Just like books and magazines, every one has their own taste in music. some like country, classical, metal, and maybe even rock. If you took the songs that were offensive off the shelf that would make people angry. That's like not playing a song on the radio thats offensive, and many songs played on the radio are degradeing to women. if it can be played on the radio. Why cant it be in a library? there going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway.     Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects. Many people are interested in these movies. If you can watch that movie in a movie theatre, why cant you check it out of a library? Some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent. What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf? Fail? I know i would become angry if that would happen to me.     Keep offensive books, music, movies, and magazines on the library shelfs. People will eventually see them, hear them, and watch them even if its not in the library. Even if you take out offensive materials there still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do
<START>

When have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf? Have you ever read a book half way through and questioned why you are reading it? Why would you read a book that you know you're not going to like?     If someone has the right and the authority to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then I have the exact same right as them. I thought everyone was treated by equal rights. When i ever do read I always read the back of the book or whats called the summary of the story so I can see if I'm going to like it or not. If I know a book is going to offend me or a magazine or even a movie, most likely I'm not going to even bother giving my attention to them.     Obviously the author doesnt like censorship or she wouldnt be arguing about it. It's obviously something that bothers her and everyone is intitiled to their own beliefs and disbeliefs. I respect people that stand up for themselves and find the hardest ways out of hard prediciments. I can say I always go to libraries and read books because I'm not a reader. But i can tell you if I ever did go to a library and i found a book on the shelf that offends me its probably going to offend someone else. So why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion. But i think if it's going to offend someone in praticular it's probably going to bother someone else. I'm not saying everyone is alike but most people believe in things that other people believe in. People can hav the same agreements and disagreements.     I do have to agree with @PERSON1 because she is right. You would be amazed on the amount and different things people can get offended by. I have tons of experiences of movies, books, music, and magazines that have offended me. But I didnt let it pull me down or anything. For example I stopped watching the movie, and I stopped reading the book that bothered me. You can't wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe. @CAPS1't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your opinions. If certain things offend you, @CAPS1't let them bother you just stop doing what your doing and move on to something else.     Like I said I have had alot of experiences of offensive things I have read and watched. Like awhile back I watched a movie that had a black man in it and he was locked in prison and killed in prison for being accused of something he didn't do. It was just because the time era and it was also because he was black. Thats the kind of stuff that really upsets me. Because we are all the same. We @MONTH1 look different and see things different. But our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air. I have always gone by the saying, '@CAPS1't ever judge a book by it's cover until you read it.'     So whatever people @MONTH1 think I believe in one thing and it's to let people believe in things they want to believe in. @CAPS1't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel. I agree with Katherine Paterson.
<START>

When I go to a library I @MONTH1 find some stuff that is offensive to me. But if somthing is offensive to me the person beside me @MONTH1 not  think the same thing  is offensive to him or her. When people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not . There is a wide variety of people that all have diffrent opinions based on their history.      What I think is offensive @MONTH1 be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded and other people's eyes. The major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set definition. I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on. There needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups. For example you would not want a kindergarder to be able to check out a @CAPS1 movie.      Some censoring has to be done to protect people.But it all comes down to common sense. We won't ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem @MONTH1 be solved
<START>

Certain people beleive that offensive books, magazines, or music should be taken off of the shelves of libraries. I think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves. It is a persons own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so. It is also not another persons right to decide what other people can and cannot observe. If certain offensive things were taken off of the shelves of libraries such as music, books etc. the knowledge of people would be limited to only what the library or the government would want them to know and that is not right.     It is someones personal decision wether or not they look at listen to or read offensive things. People shouldn't be sheltered by society and only know what is wanted for them to know. If libraries eliminated offensive media then people would be able to form their own oppinions and ideas. In some cases reading and knowing certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world. One case is how people should know about the holocaust in the @DATE1. Im shure reading about the holocaust is very affensive to copius amounts of people, but even though this history is disturbing and offensive people should know about it so that history does not repeat itself.      The government and society does not have the right to decide what people take in. For example what if all of a certain type of music was eliminated from libraries, the internet, and tv; it would slowly dissolve out of  existence. Certain things like reading about the times before racial equality, and such things as slavery are very offensive for people to read about. But these things must be read and heard and passed down through history so it isn't forgotten.      The knowledge of offensive things should not be taken away from people by the libraries. Yes offensive things shouldnt be celebrated or looked upon as good but people should know. People in the world cant just know the good things or only what their society wants them to know, they also have to know about the bad things and offensive things that happen and have happened as well.

Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. ' In this quote I think she was trying to get across that if someone picks up a book or a magazine and reads it and then puts it back and maybe its not the best book ever to them and they @MONTH1 find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they @MONTH1 not find it offensive, then you have two different view points on a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but to another it @MONTH1 not be. Different view points really effect how to censor books, because of how people are so different, there difference on how they feel about a book could effect what should happen to that book.     I dont believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone. If they are found offensive to a bunch of different people then yes they should be removed, but if its only bothering one or two people but there are other people that agree that its not offensive, then dont get rid of it just because of a couple people. Take a vote maybe to see how many people agree and dissagree on keeping or getting rid of it then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it off of that vote. I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it. If someone has a memory about something they read or remember an experience from it and then someone else reads it and feels offened by something its not fair to the other person to get rid of it. Its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences.     So dont  remove books just because a couple people might find it offensive, take a vote to decide. Let more than just a few people deciede on behalf of the book. More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what differnt views you @MONTH1 find from different people on just one book. People need to be able to discuss their veiws on the book and then bedate on whether or not to keep it, so dont choose to get rid of them without several view points on the book.

Library Censorship     Everyone has their favorite book. But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it? Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain.     As americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music. But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as an american citizen.      Personally, I hate rap. I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings. But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it. Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed?     One of my favorite series is the @PERSON2 series, by @PERSON1. It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growning up by depending on @CAPS1, and it helped me do the same. But because it is a @CAPS2 series, should it be removed from shelves? Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive?     Although some wish they could elimate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work. However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it. Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid. Libraries are suppost to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive.

Cencorship in books is one of the main concerns in @LOCATION1. If it was up to me to remove a book from a shelf, I would not do it, to my personal opinion, I think that we as @CAPS1's should just read over the probloms and quit complaining about it. Yes, we do have some books that people seem to not like, such as 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', but the only reason that it has been pulled off the shelfs of librarys and schools is because it uses the word 'nigger', and I find it to be kind of idiodic, that people would over react to that word when themselves were not even around to know the real meaning of.     Cencorship in music. This is another big concern for people in @LOCATION1. The lyrics used in most songs I find to be 'disturbing' or are trying to get people and young kids to comite acts of crime and other illigal acts. Music such as rap and the lyrics used in rap are whats making kids do stupid stuff, the music talks about sex, drug usage, and murder. I don't think that I would go as far as to pull it off the shelf, but I would make the sellers put them in a 'can only perchas if @NUM1' section. Most of the crime we have today people blame on music.     To my observation about these subjects are that I have seen people read a book that uses profound language in it and be ok with it, they don't over react to it so therfor it shouldn't be removed from shelfs. To my observation about the rap music, sure, in a way it should be pulled off the shelfs and never be sold again, but, I have seen people who listen to it and never smoke, never kill, and never harms another person. To my own experience I listen to some of these gore obbsessed bands and read profound languaged books and got over it, these thing should be overlooked and forgotten.     This is just a common scence thing but, there are a lot of things that should be pulled off shelfs, I would, and it has to do with movies and magazines. Some movies have always been a problom to society, I have witnessed this that some movies show just a little bit to much nudeity in it, which I seem to think is not a good thing that our younger children should see, whether it's at the theater or on t.v. this things should be pulled.     My observation about magazines it that I have personal her one of my best friends say that 'I want to look as skinny and this girl does on this magazine because I'm to fat'. There are a lot of magaziens that should not be showed or read because it does say that skinny is better and so many girls and women are starving themselves to look like the person on the cover of a magazien, and it's rediculous to see that happen, If it was my choise, I would ban these matirals from useage or sight, mainly because this is all just one big peer presure conspericy. I would not ban all of the things that I have put in this paper, just the things that I that personal find disturbing or not fot the publics eye's.

I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries.   In my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing. Also, it depends on what what the ages the kids are or adults. People are different in many ways. It also depends on the way they take it in their signifaction.     If they move books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves because their offensive that wouldn't be a very good idea because how would other people get ahold of it and want to read it in life, if they get taken off the shelves? Some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else. I just don't think that people would be to happy. Also, they're different cultures in these countries that read stuff like that.      People would like to learn about different things. If people took the books and other things like that off the shelves, there would be hardly anything to read. Childrens and up to adult books has all different kinds of things. The books and things like that you can read can have more things in it besides offensive things, sometimes they can have more information in those books than others.      In my conclusion, censorship is not good in our public libraries because it taking basic things out of the libraries and taking half of the reading from people.

If the library is in a highschool then we are all old enough that we have already seen or heard anything and everything offensive. In case we haven't though you can't shield your kids from offensive material. This @CAPS1 hurts them in the long run. Such as when your boss gets to work and you or someone around you mess up a important assignment or task he @MONTH1 use terms such as the '@CAPS2' word or other vulgar terms to describe how mad he is. If you were to just hear those for the first time being yelled at you there is a chance you would have a break down or be ineffective for work.      Now im not saying we should all 'cuss' every day and talk in vulgar tongue. Im just saying that the real world doesnt have a 'clean' version. there is no mom or dad there to stand by and say, 'oh no thats not acceptable speech son'. If you took a survey of daily langauge of teens and young adults almost @PERCENT1 would say they use some form of vulgar langauge or inapporiate terms. We need to have our kids and teens to know its not ok to say those things and they need to know what is acceptable in society and not. but taking from them in the library and then thrusting them in a world with daily inapproite acts in not right
<START>

Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something agaist it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries.        Everyone has their own opinions. There are so many things that effect our opinions. Our beliefs, life styles, way of thinking, culture, and the list goes on. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I dont like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldnt bother me but that would be extreamly selfish. Even if something is totally innopropriate and offensive it is still information. Maybe it shouldnt go in the little kids section of a library or store but i dont think it should be removed completely. Music especially. There are wide ranges of music from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on. I dispise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people i know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are.         So no, I dont think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We cant hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove thing materials we dont care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then were left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy

I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries.  Books are wrote to stimulate the imagination of a persons mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever wrote until that person has grown up.  And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics.     For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature.  So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets the he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive.  What would that person do?  Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country, I say no!       This is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader.  From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career.  For example, when I was in the @NUM1 grade  was assigned a book report over @PERSON1, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found.  I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro inprinted on its pages.  So I asked her if I could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well.  I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over.  So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find @PERSON1.  But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem.     Another example was when my friend @PERSON2 wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from.  But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the arabic world.  So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION1?'  And the librarian said that they were all removed because after @NUM2 @CAPS1 saw arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked.  I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race.     These are only a few things that have already happened becaue of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by.  Sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf.  Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to effect libraries of the public.

Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising.     Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies have are cusswords. Also some @MONTH1 have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff.     Also another thing are advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as its good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in @CAPS1 hand, and we think its cool to try it, but its not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or inscents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college.     The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, @CAPS1 could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines @CAPS1 can be pictures in which you don't approve in either. So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have innapropiate scenes, and innapropiate pictures.     Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising @CAPS1 is. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about.

Books that are found offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. Books tell stories fiction or non-fiction. Many books that @MONTH1 be found offensive are historical. These books could include topics such as wars, eras, people, ect. Everyone has the same rights to read any book they want. They also have the right to not read the book at all.      Books that are taken off the shelves of a library because of one person, or a group of people, being offended henders the ability of someone who wants to read the book, to read the book. We, as people, should not be able to take this right away from other people. They should be able to read anything they want. If someone wants to read a biography or history about @CAPS1, they should be able to.      The topic of @CAPS1 and the @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 be found to be offensive because of what they stand for. If we look at the topic as purely a historical reference not as a story to be read for enjoyment there will never be any offence in these books. These stories have a large role in history. If we do not learn from their mistakes, history @MONTH1 repeat itself. History is around to be studied, even if the topics might be offensive to some people.     Political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story. Such as in To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4. This book has many issues when it comes to political correctness. These issues include; the killing of an innicent man and revealing the flaws in our judicial system, the use of the word 'nigger' to describe the black characters, and the racial unequality of the @LOCATION1 duringthe @DATE1's. These issues would deffinately be offensive to some readers, but this book is an award winner and uses history as a guide. The situations in this novel are ones that could be real. They are things we must learn about, so we do not repeat them.     Another story that fits quite well into this topic is @CAPS5 @NUM1. This novel is about a world where all books are burnt. No books are allowed to be read by the people. This book reveals the removal of offensive books to its exteme. No matter who you are or what you believe, there will be some topics that you find offensive. If we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library. A library is not a library wihout its books.     If we allow books to begin to be removed from the shelves, we will not be able to stop it. One day we will end up like the world in @CAPS5 @NUM1. No history will be know but what is passed down. No more stories will be here to entertain us, but the ones memorized. No books will exzist and this world would be terrible without books.     Books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. The taking away of these books takes away the freedom to read anything you want. It reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish. Political correctness should not take the place of our own freedom, and as long as we keep our books on their shelves, it won't

I believe that libraries should have more cencorship. Some books, magazines, and movies should be removed or grouped by age. From my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, I believe they should be removed because they influence violence, sexual activity, and drug use. Young children should not be exposed to those things yet.     First, I think books that contain violence should be removed. I believe that children are the easiest people to influence. I also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by. Violence in books can influence killing. Fighting and killing is not good. No young child should be able to check out about full of shooting and fighting. The book will make the kids think thats the right thing to do if they are able to check it out. Being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes. Reading a book is not worth going to jail for.     Next, I believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries. Sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it. For example, a young girl reading about teen pregnacy not being a problem. The reader will think that is what she is suppsed to do which is wrong. Books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children. Those thing @MONTH1 influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing. You can atleast sort them all in an adult section.     Finally, drug use should not be issued in books to kids. children should not read or watch anything that are talking about drugs in a positive way. Unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them, children should not read them at all. Drugs make people do things that their right mind don't want them to do. Children should say no to drugs and to books that are influencing the opposite.     In coclusion, that is why I believe that we need censorship in our libraries. we need censorship because of viloence and drug use. Also becuse of sexual activity and many more things

Dear newspaper and staff,               @CAPS1 has came to my attention that @CAPS1 is being considered that most libraries in the community @MONTH1 have a removal and or censorship of some books in the libary. I find this not accepable; in my opinion this is a attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offenisve reading material from futher generations. For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labled ' A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1', this book describes a childs heartships and the abuse he takes on a daily basics. Books of this sort are not only imformitive @CAPS1 also gives the reader an open mind on how things might have been. Some topics @MONTH1 include; slavery, abuse, war, and discrimation.                These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society. Censoring and removal of these book are pointless; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue. @CAPS1 is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships, problems, and lessons in which these topics araised. Without imforming our generations of these issues @CAPS1 could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent!          My opinion on movies however are a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material. Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that @MONTH1 be offesive or perhaps discrimating. They @MONTH1 also need adult combinations to preview the movie.           So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues. I just fully believe open @ORGANIZATION1 content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed. I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks!                                              Sincerly,                                                                                     @PERSON1- @ORGANIZATION1

Everyone today gets offeneded daily. So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelfs is no different than the rest of the day. However, there are those minds, which have not been poluted and influenced by these offensive materials, that should have a right to keep thier minds that way.      One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies. The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the lirary while the lower rated material is put on display for the public. The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public, and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way.     Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material. It, in my opinion and experience, corrupts both the mind and soul, and causes man to be things he is not by nature. Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things ment for inside of marrage, often accoplish nothing of great value in their life time. They are thus a hinderence to soceity. But if they can not accsess the material, they then need something to do to fill that time. In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty @CAPS1 off the shelf.     This thus leaves the labraries with a choice. They can leave their library the way that they want, they can put the offensive material in a seclueded room, or they can remove definent offensive material and keep soceity on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to odserve. Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendence goes up.

Have you ever found or seen books, music, movies, or magazines in a library that are offensive to you? If so, then would you have wanted to remove it off of the shelf so none of your children or anyone else that might have found it offensive, to see it? Well, I have actually gone to the library and seen some things that was offensive to me, and I have also heard my family members talking about it. So I am going to talk about what I have heard about my family seeing or finding books, music, movies, and magazines offensive. Also, I am going to explain how I felt and what i wanted to do when i seen those things in a library that was offensive to me. The last thing that I am going to talk about is how I feel on censorship in libraries.     First, I have been hearing from my sisters, my mother, and my step-mother about how they find some books, music, movies, and magazines at a library that was offensive to them. Now I do not know exactly what the books, magazines, etc., was that they found offensive but I do know what they thought about them and what they wanted to do. So one day, my sisters, mother, and step-mother was talking about a couple of books that she found offensive. They never said what the books were but they kept talking about how they felt and what they would have liked to do with them. Now she told my family and I that she was badly offended by what they were called and what they were about. Also she was saying that she would have really liked to have taken the books, music, movies, etc., off of the shelves, so other people that might have found them offensive would not see them. But, they all did also agree on the fact that they really do not have the right to remove them from the shelves. Their reason why they do not have that right is because of there are a lot of people who they do not know if they find it offensive or not. The people who do not find it offensive might actually want to read them. So, they just agreed to look past them and ignore what is there if it offends them for the people who do not find them offensive.     Now, from my point of view from finding or seeing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., in a library that are or was offensive to me. There have been a couple of times where I have walked in a library where I found a couple of books that was offensive towards me. I really did not like what the books were all about and called, and I really would have liked to take them off the shelves and throw them away so no other person who might have found them offensive would find them or see them. So what if there are other people who would have actually wanted to read those books? That was what I thought about when I was tempted to actually remove them. So I decided not to remove the books from the shelves, so the people who did not find them offensive could read them, if they wanted to. I respected the fact that there are other people that are out there that would want to read those books but at the same time, I knew that there are people who could find them offensive but I just thought that they would just ignore the fact that they are there.     So, on to the last thing that I am going to talk about. Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves, at a library, if they are found offensive? Also my views on censorship in libraries. Well I do believe that they should be removed so they wpuld not be offending anyone that walked into that library. But, if people had the right to remove books or anything that is offensive towards them, then there would literally be no books left in the libraries. Then there would not be any point in having libraries or in anyone writing books. So then again, I do not believe that any person should have a right to just remove the books that are offensive to them at all. I belive that if they find a book that is offensive to them, then they should just ignore that it is there and respect that there are a lot of people out there who would want to or like to read those books. So I do not believe that there should be any censorship in libraries at all. It is not anyones fault that people find books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive to them. So no, there should absolutely not be any censorship in a library.    So there, I have just explained my views on censroship in libraries and if I believe that people should have the right to remove books from a shelf just cause they found it offensive.  Like I have stated before, there should not be any censorship in libraries at all. But yes, I do understand that people find things that are offensive, but they should just ignore that they are there and respect that there are people who want to or would like to read those books. Once again, do you believe that people should have the right to remove a book from a shelf just cause they found it offensive, and what are your views on censorship in libraries?

Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of veiw, or to perhaps state an oppionion, of which everyone has a different point of veiw.     No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are rated. Movies are rated @CAPS1 through @CAPS2, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker, so just follow the ratings. IF a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @CAPS2 movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age. People @MONTH1 bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it. The solution to that problem is simple create a seperate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section. Have cameras near by so if a yongster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an i.d. for entrance. These are still books which are expressions of a persons dreams, hope, desires, fantasies, and heart, they should not be denied there dream because a person deems it unfit. And most apparent if it offends you dont read it.     Simply follow the rating rules. Take necesary precations. If all of these rules are followed then buisnesses and libraries should have no probles keeping everybody safe and happy.

If I could remove anything from shelves of libraries I wouldn't.  Would you rather your kids to learn things from the facts or learn from friends?  Censoring books, magazines, movies, etc and what goes onto the shelves are mostly for enjoyment or informational.  Granted you wouldn't want a five-year old reading a book made for adults, but with age kids would have to learn things.  You can't always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere including college and on into their adult life.     Books provide facts and more reliable information than what  you can hear from people.  If all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off, how would someone write a report on those things.  The books were created to provide people, kids especially, with facts that no one else could share and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge.  If someone were to find a book or a @CAPS1 offensive, they don't have to look at it or even pick it up.  Libraries can't always suit everyone's tastes and something you @MONTH1 find offensive isn't to others.  Takign a single book from the shelves would result in others taking books off the shelves and then no books would be left for anyone to read or wish to take off the shelves.     If you controlled what everyone read, no one would be happy and their brain wouldn't function correctly.  You'd be taking one of their rights, one of the only things entitled to them without someone else telling them they can't.  What kids read is shaping their minds for their future.  If you removed their favorite series or genre from the shelves, they wouldn't read or listen to music or anything anymore because it isn't enjoyable.  Kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to.     So with that, I wouldn't take anything off the shelves because everything appeals to someone in one way or another.  Controlling what one person reads doesn't lead you nor the other person anywhere, someone could end up being offended if you take something you find offensive off the shelves, and you can't stop the knowledge that books can provide people if they read them.  In one way or another something provides information for people.

Hi my name is @PERSON1 I have a couple topics that I would       like to talk to you about. I have been hearing alot of people          talking about libraries taking alot of there stuff off the shelves      well I think that that the libraries around the world have alot        of information inside of them and if we started taking                  information out of them then what would be the point in              having them. I think that everything in libraries are very               important and who is to know that everybody wants this to          happen. The one thing that I dont really think that libraries           need in them is movies because like pretty much every movie      has a book that goes with it or is the same thing pretty much.       And lets get on with the whole offensive thing I think everone      should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say         even if it is hurtfull. Though I think that the more people read      about what people are saying about them is the less that              they are goin to care because they are goin to just be so used       to it that they are not even goin to know what they are                talking about. If there was one thing that I could tel the world      it would be dont be offened by what people say to you.

You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, @CAPS3 all of them are responsible enough to handle @CAPS1. You could blabber in their ear all day about '@CAPS1's responsible to do this and @CAPS3 do this.' and they will go out and do @CAPS1 anyways. Trust me, I'm a teenager. I know. So there are certin things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted on what @CAPS2 matters in their teenage years. And that is schoolwork.     If school systems allowed there to be offensive or innapropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be...well... 'distracted'. And when I say innapropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean for school. You would like to think that they would possibly save @CAPS1 for when they checked out and went home and did their work first but, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want. And what they want to do is @PERCENT1 of the time @CAPS3 schoolwork. They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals.      School work is a very important thing in teenagers lives, and I feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities. If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do @CAPS1 at home. Offensive books should @CAPS3 be there to only distract the teenager from school. @CAPS1's unneccesary. But with public libraries, @CAPS1's a whole new story.     I beleive that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go their on their own free will. I know I personaly go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people. @CAPS1's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because @CAPS3 only do teenagers go there, but adults do too. @CAPS1 is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what your there for? The library is for people to go and read, whether @CAPS1's just for the heck of @CAPS1 or for school.     @CAPS3 everyone is responsible. Especially @CAPS3 teenagers. So that's why I personally beleive offensive or innapropriate materials should @CAPS3 be allowed in school libraries, but allwowed in public libraries. Although equal rights and freedom in necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is the key to their future

All people have the same right to read, listion and watch different materials. To be censored should be no one choise but your own. For some one else to tell you what and what not to read is by my openion very wrong to do. If we would censore everything we did we would have a city and nation that would @DATE1 slowly.   Any givein word can offend any certain person. The people that they offend are in my oppioen are the dead weights of our country that are just holding us back from fully ecpressing our self, the colorfull words that we @MONTH1 use can be offensive to one persson yet perfeectly fine to another. It all depends on the indivadual that likes or dislikes the word or readings. In my observations of people reading and dislikeing it because of it harsh and colorfull words is most offen people that do not fully express them selvs and our yet much more senitive. I think this also goes agenst freedom of speech. We were gaven that right so why wouldent we use it? Why wouldent people want us to express ourselvs? I have no idea why any person would want to take books,music,movies and magazines away from us. If every thing went by one mans rule of what to and not to read we would down grade as a country and @DATE1. Therefore i strongly advise not to take any books off the selves. The majordy of the people agree with me to not be censored and only the sensitive people that they offened will just make there own chiose not to pick the book off the selves,not to listen to music, And pick up the magazine. the right is ours and thats how is should stay
<START>

Censorship. It's a word that everyone has heard, but do people truly know what it means or how it effects them? In the past, books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful. How could they say that they knew what was best for their people? What gave them the right to decide what their people could or could not read? In today's society, we still have to deal with censorship issues. There are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books. Censorship is wrong. Books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive. Everyone has different tastes, not only in food, but in every other part of their lives as well. No one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another. Censorship is wrong because it limits what people can read, watch, and listen to.     Censorship should not be allowed because it limits what people can read.  Some people like mysteries, while others like to read romantic books.  If we allow people to censor what we read, then how can we say that their is a book for everyone to like? If libraries censored every book that might offend someone else, then there would not be any books left for anyone to read. For example, certain religious books might offend people of other religions, but that does not mean that we should take them off the shelves. If we did that, we would have to take away all religious books so that no one was offended. Then no one would be able to find books about their religion, and no one would benefit.     Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch. If we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else, there would be no more movies left in the world. Every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate. If we only focus on the person who hates it and get rid of movies based on the people who hate them, then the people who love the movies will suffer for it.  People who love horror movies probably hate comedies.  This does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because that there are some people who dislike them. It only means that the people who don't like that type of movie don't have to watch them.     In the exact same way, censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love.  We can't censor music because everyone has different types and genres that they like. If we take away one kind of music, then we have to take away every kind of music.  It is not fair to say that we can censor one genre of music because some people dislike it or find it offensive when there are people who truly enjoy listening to that type of music. It would be unfair to those people, and if we are unfair to them, we have to be unfair to everybody. People would be even more offended than before in that case.     There will always be unhappy people in the world.  We should not result to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to try make people happy.  Censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy.  It makes the the people who would like the items that have been censored mad.  We should not result to that. We should allow people to pick what they like.  If a person want to read something they should be allowed.  If they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song, then why not let them?  The slim margin of people who dislike what those people enjoy can just avoid reading, watching, or listening to it. We can't take something away from the people who love it just because someone is unhappy.
