When are they gonna be here! When are they gonna be here! I was in @CAPS1 visiting my family and my cousins were gooing  to be coming in from @LOCATION1. I was so exited and very impatient I couldn’t wait until they pulled up in their black car and I could give them a hug that would knock the daylights out of them. It was around lunch time and i was watching out the window while eating cold pizza. I kept on counting down from ten say they are gonning to be here in @NUM1 but they were never their. Soon i realized it was about @NUM2 p.m and knew i wouldn’t see them untill tomorrow and i will be patient so i don’t waste the whole entire day thinking about it. After a good nights rest i got up are breakfast, and then watched some @CAPS2. @PERSON1! @PERSON1! Honk!Honk! could it really be no it couldn’t it was uncle @CAPS3 and his big motorcycle. A few hours later i heard @PERSON1 again and said uncle @CAPS3 is probably leaving but then i herd my cousins @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5 flew up out of the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked  the daylights out of them. I guess patience really is the key.

A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words “practice makes perfect” she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me.

One time it was hard to wait, but I was patient and in the end it was @CAPS1. One time my family and I were going to @CAPS2 world. The morning I woke up I was so excited because I really wanted to get the air port and go to @CAPS2 world @CAPS4 we packed to car we drove to the airport. In the car my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. Once we got to the airport we got supper excited! When we got to the area were you wait for your plane the workers told every one waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to @LOCATION1 was gonna be around one hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to @ORGANIZATION1 world as soon as we could, but we would just have to wait, we walked around the air port and, and got something to eat. Then @CAPS4 that we only had to wait twenty more minutes! My family and I just set down and talked and before we knew it we were  getting on the plane. Being patient can really help the soutition.

On @DATE1 it was my birthday I was just turning @NUM1. I was so happy!!! Well while I was being happy and my big sisters were getting thing together for my party my mom was at work. We had everything at the party thing such as juice, pop, food, candy, chips, icecream, but no cake. My mom was suppose to pick it up when she got of work. Then it was time to open the gifts. After we opened all my gifts, it was time for cake and icecream. We had the icecream but no cake, but I didn’t cry and scream like a baby, my sister did but she was still @NUM2 and I was @NUM1 and I had to act as a @NUM1 year old. My mom called and told us she was running a little late and she would be here after she get my cake. When my mom got home we cut the cake and when I took the first bite I said to myself it was worth the wait! I was happy I waited like a big kid, but I was even more happier I was @NUM1!
<START>

I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months –old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when “her baby,” @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it.

Patience is a very long task @CAPS2 the rewards out weigh the time you waited for the thing you were waiting for. From waiting for a computer to start up to a line to a rollar coaster, your patience will be rewarded. However many people are not very patient. (@CAPS1 me) @CAPS2 they can learn over time to be as patient as monks. In short, be @CAPS1 a trile and lots of patience.

One time when I was little we were going to the dentist in ann- @CAPS1  and the was a lot of traffic and me my sister and my brother were in the car (we ended up waiting for @NUM1 hours) I was really unhappy so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I know. It means to wait and be calm. When I got to the dentist and sat down. I found out I was late so we had to go back home and do it again tomorrow.
<START>

A time when I was patient was when I went to sedar point. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and it was a long ride. When we got there it was a long line to get in. My mom said “all right guies time to be patient”. Once we got in we went to the first rid we seen. It also had a long line. Mom said “we are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the rides”.

Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friends house on a trapoline one hot @DATE1 day. When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was exstremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Some times being patient has rewards.  My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office.

One time at the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I was getting some arrows but no one was there to ring up my arrows. So instead of ringing the bell a hundred times I just waited there quitley and patiently.

As I walked down the lane looking for the perfect gift I saw the day before. I find out it was sold out. Today was my mom’s birthday and I find the gift. The perfect gift a precious moment figurine. I asked the manager  if fact had any in the back sadly they didn’t. He said “The new shipment should be arriving at five”. I didn’t think I could wait another three hours. My dad drove me home. I was pacing back and forth thinking it would occupies sadly it didn’t. Finally I realized I needed to relax and be patient before. I know if the time was five and my dad and I went back at the store in no time and there was the perfect gift right there in front of me. I picked it up and give it to the clerk to scan. I hand her the money and head strait home. When mom get home I hand mom the gift and realize patient come in handy when it comes to waiting.

One day we were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 for a very special event to see the president of the united states of @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 when we got to the park where we going to see him there were cars parked a mile away! When we finally parked the car we started walking it was a long walk but when we finally got to the gate I was excited! after we got through security we though we would never get there. Me and my parents stood in that I think for about two hours until finally everybody spread out and look their places sang the national anthem the president stepped up to the podium and gave along speech. It was the longest line I ever stood in and I was very patient.
<START>

One day I was at a baseball game in @LOCATION1 and the line was huge it stretch out for half a mile and we were at the end. So it took us about an hour to get up there so I had to be very very patient or else my dad would’ve gone crazy, so that’s my story about patience.
<START>

There was only @NUM1 minutes of class left and I had @CAPS1 to do. So I watched the clock tick down over so slowly. @NUM1 minutes left @NUM3 @NUM4 at @NUM5, the teacher asked, “what are you doing?” I said, “@CAPS1. I have @CAPS1 to do” “why don’t you put your headdown?” I was losing my patience and was going to snap, but didn’t. I put my head down and next thing I know, its time to go. I kept my patience and didn’t get in trouble.
<START>

Did you know that patients are one of the key to happiness. For an example I was walking and @CAPS1 this guy walked up. To and started talking to me about his family (just remember I wasn’t very patient at the time.) @CAPS1 he kept going on and on until I snaped and said “do you know to shut up”! badly he said “yes” @CAPS1 ran home., crying. @CAPS1 I went home and when I got home I felt sad for the guy, @CAPS1 said “sorry”.! And for some reason he said “got you” I said “what” I was so mad but I was happy when it was over. But that taught me a lesson though, always be patient because you don`t know who watching, literally.
<START>

I am always patient with my family, my mom and @CAPS1 do a lot of me and fan always patient if they take some where. Sometimes, for hockey my mom and @CAPS1 take me. Hockey. My @CAPS1 usally takes but on @DATE1 my mom takes me and I patient. For homework, I am always patient, if I go to @PERSON1’s golfland my mom, saids she will take and I’m always patient.

Patience. My cousin ??? most patient person I have ever met. @LOCATION1 is studying to be a doctor, he must go through eight years of college. Eight years of termanology, teaching cells, learning human anology he has to be patient. My cousin goes to @ORGANIZATION1 which is pretty close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home a lot and never complain about homework or school or anything has got the highest patient ??? trust me. He is the perfect role model. Romeo is on his fifth year of college which means four down four to go. He doesn’t have a certain way of taking stress out besides the fact he squeezes his??? It’s not easy being motivated and relaxed ??? does that. Before he left for @ORGANIZATION1 he told me patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo is patient.
<START>

Here is a story, about patience, in my own way called @CAPS1’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  “@CAPS4, hurry up and find my shoes ??????  And I do not want to be late for school again”. I hollered at my @CAPS4 “@CAPS1”, @CAPS4 said in a hustled voice, you asked me a second ago, it doesn’t take a second to find some lost shoes, you just have to be patient.” “I know, I know, I sighed but I still don’t want to be late” “I know but remember, being patient will get you far.” “@CAPS6” I agreed. So that @CAPS3 at school @CAPS1 remembered her moms words and was very patient all @CAPS3. She didn’t whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didn’t cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didn’t grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldn’t be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom. Prity soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3 I huged my @CAPS4 so hard then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on.

@CAPS1 was a beautifal morning, sky was blue, birds were singing, and my sister was going skydiving. Her and her boyfriend zone, were playing to go sky diving so me, my friend,, and my parents taged along to watch. We had a couple people in front of them so we had to wait for an hour or so. Then another hour passes. Still not even close to being there turn. We were starting to get hungrey so we went into town and order some breakfast, we got our drinks and were about to get our food when we got a call that they were going soon. We had to cancle our meal and hurry back to the place. We got there, still not there turn. I don't really know how but something happened to wide we had sit and wait in the middle of the field for almost four more hours! Finally there turn, they got in the plane and flew up. They circled the field for a while and then @CAPS1 looked like a little dot fell out of the plane, then another followed. They sailed down to a succes. @CAPS1 turns out that we sat there for eight hours befor they jumped. Not including the hour and a half drive there .I think that I was pretty patient that day.

“left! Right! High kick left, roundhouse sight! The boys arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs striking the bag with tremendous power! “@CAPS1!” the old man yells “my boy.” @CAPS2 says “you are lacking patience.” The old man named @ORGANIZATION1 puts a blind fold on the boy named @CAPS3 and let’s jolbs sand bags during at him. The first one hits him in the head, but the boy kicks the second one and busts it open. @CAPS2 grabs the third one and uses it to block the fourth one. The boy learned to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first.

One time I was patient when @PERSON1 @CAPS1 would not work every body sat down and was quet. It took up the hole hour there was a little, chitt chatt her and there but mostly every body was quiet for her while a capo of sudents helped her. We going to watch a movie about @NUM1 themes of @CAPS2, but when she tryed to play the movie, it wouldn’t come on you could hear it but couldn’t see it, the at the end of the hour you could see it but you couldn’t hear it, “but it worked for all the other the classes” @PERSON1 said the next day she gave us fruits snacks for being so patient and she got the movie to work first it was in just gray and white the she jiggled a card then it showed color but the day that I was patient was the @NUM2 time. I was patient with a teacher she was proud of me and I was proud of myself I can’t believe what I did for @PERSON1 then it happend again this time she let every body just chill in our chair and talk with our friend but I just watten her fix her @CAPS1 but the next day she didn’t give us a treat because our treat was just chilling in our chairs and talking with our friends’.

You being patient is important. People should always be patient &not rush anything. All you have to do is take your time & wait. People need to understand that it you are not patient then particular things want happen to you. If you ever wanted something, then you have to be patient. One day at @ORGANIZATION1, my cousin, shayna was not being patient because she wanted on get on the dance box. But, she could`nt because a lil girl named @ORGANIZATION2, was on the dance box & shayna was not happy. And you know us girls when you we get our attitudes. Shayna got mad & started to cry & roll her eyes at @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS1 she now up to me & said, “she want let me get on,” @CAPS1 I said, “@PERSON1`@CAPS2 , you have to be patient & wait your turn because she was on it first & that would be rude and unfair to make her get off.” @CAPS1 @PERSON1`@CAPS2 apologized & they both took turns on the dance box. But last, @PERSON1`@CAPS2 was happy & she learned her lesson.

A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip ,she moved slower than my grandpa you are probally asking yourself  hour does this make her patient ,@CAPS1 @CAPS2  had to follow her every where she went if @CAPS2 wasn’t patient I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in @CAPS2 mean @CAPS2 took here almost fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom . Normally I’m  not a patient person at all ,but when this  happened I had to be patient .I’m  glad @DATE1 that I was  patient because now I am more patient then I was before .My mom is proud  of my behavior ,because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed @CAPS2 .Being patient is a good thing, you look at life  different .now I can imagine me being patient.i mean I’m not glad my mum get hurt but I’m glad of my consequence of the problem .After the big accident hapend I have learned  that everyone needs a little bit of patience like me that is one example about how I thought of  I small were here away ever  been patience ,without my mom.

She is not patient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a saterday night so it was quite busy. There was a long line to @CAPS2 the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned. I told her, “@CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes.” @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms. “@CAPS2 over it you potato sak,” I told her. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around like she was in the worst case senerio. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, “@PERSON2, we gotta @CAPS2 to that counter before I explode!” I looked at her with my, why don’t you just shut-up, eyes. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 through out the night making sure she didn’t go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didn’t @CAPS2 kicked out.

I was just waiting for his to be done. Then his picture was done we looked at it and we all laughed. I was next I sat on the seat the sun was right on me. I got very hot and I did not just want to sit their but I was patient. I didn’t say a word just sat their and smiled. A picture that took about @NUM1 to draw felt like a half hour. Then I was done. I looked at the picture laughed and smiled I liked it. I was patient and I got what I wanted. A time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1.

I patience is a privilege I generally don't have, @CAPS1, I made an exception, though. @CAPS3 brother, @PERSON1 ran out to the car running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was," @CAPS2 need to talk." @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded." @CAPS4 about at @NUM1?" I knew @CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 got an in-school suspension, around me. If @CAPS3 brother hadn't of cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 divulged into his story causing tension in the air. "@CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really very friend poured water purposely on @CAPS3 sweatshirt, @CAPS12 I went to tell the principle, @CAPS3 @LOCATION1"  "@CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do," @CAPS3 @CAPS15 interrupted. " @CAPS9. @CAPS12 the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started to follow me, and I felt threatened."  I held @CAPS3 breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not @CAPS10. "@CAPS3 @CAPS5 filled in the next part, "@CAPS12 you. Started punching him?" "@CAPS13, yes." @CAPS14 admitted miserably. "@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,"@CAPS15 scolded. "I know, I know now. I 'm sorry," @CAPS3 brother shuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, "would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?" "@CAPS16"I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day.

One time I was patient was when I was standing in a line at the petting zoo. The animal I was waiting in line to see, was a donkey. It was a hot @DATE1 day around three in the afternoon of course a donkey was the crowds favorite animal. There only a couple people observing the other animals. In the donkey line, there were hundreds. I was around the middle of the line. I was getting tired but I had see to this donkey! I was being very patient waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally only a couple people were in front of me! I could get a slight view of the donkey. A couple minutes passed old I was petting the donkey: @CAPS1 was that patience worth it or what? I thought to myself. I left the petting zoo, happy. I had never been that patient in my life! I gave myself a bat on the back.

A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually to me, a very funny way of impatience.  My classmates and I were divided into groups at differents areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification identifying the differen characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects be taping their plants on their poster. After fighting for the tape from another group hogging it. Our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came to get tape. One of them tried to take some pieces and I guess to the other one he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, “@CAPS1 @CAPS2!” as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious!

Being patient means waiting, when one of my brothers was patience. We were there for six hours just to bail out my brother, we had to go to four different prisons to take my brother out. I was scared but I knew ther if I was patient everything would come out good. So we were waiting we had to bail him at before @NUM1 o’clock. We were theire since @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My mom was very nervous. I told her many time to calm down everything was going to be alright. So he and my cousin went in we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they weren’t bailing out at that time that maybe around @NUM3. So we went to get something to eat. We went again and they told us we had to sign a paper. So we did. Then it was @NUM4 o clock. They gave us something we had to cook. We went to @NUM1 different stores and they said we couldn’t cash it. So we went to the chase bank and we cashed it and we took out my brother.

One day it was a cool new game that came out. It was a kid that had volume @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @DATE1, but they said this is the hot volume.

The boy said “@CAPS5, could I please get @NUM4 ???, so I can buy this game. The father said “@CAPS6, I know how much you want this game, but I’m sorry I need to help your mother pay bills. The @CAPS6 said “@CAPS4 I understand.” @CAPS8 the boy’s grandmother called and said I need someone to cut my law for @NUM5”. The boy grinned and said “ I’ll be right over there.” @CAPS1 mowed the lawn with excitement. When @CAPS1 got the @NUM5??? @CAPS1 went right to the game store and when @CAPS1 arrived the line was @DATE1 blocks long.

Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?’’ “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .” “Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient , it might’ve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day.

This story is about chicken hand the fox and a time he had to be patient. Let me set the scene, clung the scourge sends chicken hound and his mother, @PERSON1, to be boiled. They were both supposed be killed and thrown in the ditch. But chicken hound had only blached out. When he awoke he realized his situation and knew that he would have to wait until dark to get to @CAPS1 wall and waited although insects had snowded on him. Finally when the cover of night came he rolled in the mud to prevent any further blood loss and began his journey. That is when chicken hound had to be patient.

I have used patience many times. I use my patience when @ORGANIZATION1 on the bus, at home and at school. The first time when used patiencewas when I was fishing. I was to at the time I had my tweety @CAPS1 fishing in one hand and a bag of salt and viniger in the other. And while I was waiting for a fish, I met my friend bubbles a norweigian goose he was also out maybe a week old. When I met him I fed him some of my bait and I guessed he liked warms so I gave him all my bait put down pole. And as soon as I grabed my chips… I had a bite! I turned out to be a very small sun fish. But still to this day I see bubble once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). And this year he had some side kicks two ducks I named them @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. There are very friendly and love skittles. @CAPS2 is kind of shy around other ducks and @PERSON1 is very content just sitting next to me or a bench. And bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm @DATE1 grass. And this story is true. The @CAPS3.

My family and I were going to @LOCATION1 for @DATE1 break one year I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights untill we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours untill we got there. Then we checked are bags went throug securely, and went to go and find our plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours untill the plane came. Then we got off that plane we went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed to! So we had to wait a few hours again untill the plane came. Then we had to sit through another plane ride untill we finally got to @LOCATION1. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there.

Time my friend was patient! one day it was @DATE1@NUM1.and that day was when report cards came out. My grades were good I had @NUM2. But my friend @PERSON1, was failing. maths, she had an @CAPS1, and she knew if her mom see,s it she would get in trouble. @PERSON1 tryed to cross it out and put an good grade but she knew her mom will find out. so she told her mom “report cards didn’t come out yet”. And her mom believed her. So then she tried re printing it. She called me and tried to get my opinion and “I told her my honest thought and I said @CAPS2”. but “if you dant wanna get in trouble then yeah” And she said. When her mom asked her “did the report cards come out”. She said “yeah” then her mom found out its not a real report card. So her mom called the teachers and  it was a fake grade. Then she got introuble and she was patient about it and she said the truth. Her mom went to the  office and got the real grades and my friend @PERSON1 was patient while she said the truth. That’s a time were my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade.She still was honest, and patient about it. I know that it was wrong for me two tell her yeah, but she begged me so she wont get in trouble.

Have you ever been patient?  I have and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  I planned to got my @CAPS1 washed, deep-condioned, and flat-ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. “I’m sorry but @PERSON1 won’t be here today.  @CAPS3 there anyone else that you’d like to do your @CAPS1?’ A perplexed expression spread across my face. “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 here?” I asked. “yes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three o’clock. “she suggested. “that’s fine.”  I said.  My feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when I  walked outside.  It was raining. So I guess it was a good thing that I didn’t get my @CAPS1 done. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has it’s advantages.

A time when I was patient was at @CAPS1 the largest indoor water park I was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. ‘’@CAPS2 time @NUM1’’our @CAPS3 said in a robotic voice but it was only @NUM2 that means I have to be in the car for another two hours almost three, thats not fair I thought to my self but I knew if I wanted to make it to @CAPS1 I had to be patient and wait it out. ‘’I have to go to the bathroom’’ I said in a moaning vice. ‘’well cant you hold it?’’ my mother asked I’m about to explode and your asking me if I can hold it? I thought to myelf. ‘’ok pull over here, but it’s gonna add to to our @CAPS2 time.’’  ‘’I @CAPS4’t core!’’ I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car I heard our robotic @CAPS3 say ‘’@CAPS2 time @NUM3.’’ @CAPS6 man that means no more bathroom breaks I m gonna have to hold it if I have to go again. A hour or two went by when I heard the @CAPS3  say ‘’arive on destinaton on left’’  ‘’@CAPS8!’’ I schreeched out. I rushed out the door to the main entrance to @CAPS1 but then I saw a sign that ‘’water park closed!’’ when suddenly I felt my dads hand hit my shoulder and he said ‘’sorry sport maybe it will be open tommorow.’’ @CAPS9 out it was’nt open the next day it was still closed because they were working on to many rides that it was dangerous to go into the park, so I had to be patient for that whole day, but I could’nt we were leaving tommrow! Yhe next day it was closed again til five but we were expected to check out at @TIME1. So at @TIME1 the park was still closed and we were checked out ‘’I guess we can stay for the rest of the day. ll go send one more night’’ my dad said. ‘’@CAPS8.’’ I get to go in the park! And that was the time I was patient.

I think patience means when your calm and you don't care what somebody @CAPS1 @CAPS2 doing, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of patience @CAPS2 when your mom @CAPS2 shopping for a long time and you want to go to the video game store and you stay there that a good sill of patience a bad sign of patience @CAPS2 when you throw a bit of the store, @CAPS6 good sign of patience @CAPS2 when your at @CAPS3 amusement park and theres a @CAPS7 long line And you don't complain that's a very good sign of patience . A bad sign of patience In that situation @CAPS2 that you complian the whole time. . @CAPS6 good sign of patience @CAPS2 when you are waiting for your big sister to get out of the bathroom and you just wait until she gets out. A bad sign of patience @CAPS2 when you brake down the door and you have to pay for @CAPS9. Asked @CAPS6 good sign of patience. @CAPS2 when your locked out and for go to your friends house.

After me and my brother got home from school we left to go to @LOCATION2 as we where travelling  we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there . Then we seen a sign  that says “you are how leaving @LOCATION3” and another sign that said you are how entering @LOCATION1 and that’s when  it happened the traffic jam. We where going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1.m how smart was that not very but the worst part was the waiting I t  lasted for hours just sitting there but we found ways to away ourselves. Like watch the sea @PERSON2’s ,waves, and  look at the buildings there. That’s my example of patience.

A time when I had to be patient was on my birthday, about a week before my birthday, me and my dad ordered me an @CAPS1 girl doll. I was super excited because it was my first doll. The shipping was a problem, though. The week of my birthday. I kept waiting for the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 truck to come. I was dissapointed, because the shipped it from @LOCATION1 and it doesn’t take that long to get there. Another week passed and still not here. I had to be extra patient. I could track it online, but I still wasn’t happy. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the post office. Then finally my mom go ahed to ask when they’re going to send it and the lady said, “it’s on the way.” A couple minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened her up. It was worth the wait.

Patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. Taking a three hour carride is a perfect example of patience. Exactly like what I experienced. As we packed our suitcases for @CAPS1 city, I @CAPS2't contain myself. I was already packed up but mom and dad were standing. "@CAPS3 you please finish packing see I really want to go! ", I exclaimed "You'll just have to wait a minute, "Do ?? But I @CAPS2't wait, so I grabed??, threw them in the trunk of our car, and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they packed. After they finished cooking dad was carrying the last of the bags @CAPS4 their bedroom to the complain he notice me, setting patiently at the look. He thanked me, saying "@CAPS5 for being so patient, and just for that, mom and have surprise. For you. He set down the sultans, and briskly walked over to a white plastic had the suddenly pulled at a rectangular favor it was the some in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7?????? it wash ? you????????.

One of my storys of being patient is this one time was at my uncles nonse and I wanted to play the tboy @NUM1. Well the was like five other kids to and I asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient.

@NUM1 years ago our immigration limit had ran out. We needed green cards to become @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So we went to an immigration center in deproit. We walked up to the front desk and told the lady we were here. She told us to go sit it in the waiting erea. There was about @NUM2 people there! I knew we were going to be here a while that point forward. We went to the waiting erea. I had no way of amusing myself. It stricktley said in the front, no gaming devices, no musical devices. All phones must be switched off. It was tourcher. After about an hour and a half they called our name. I was so pleased. After we got our finger prints and everything completed and we walked out to the car, my mom said she was very pleased of the way I behaved in that office.

I remember a time when I was patient. I use to be able to wait for anything.one time I was so patient I asked my mom for a game and she said, tomorrow and she got the game the day I asked her. At one time I thought I was the most patient person In my whole family. I am so patient I can wait a month just before I go to cedar point. You have to be burn with patient. Some of my friends are patient but they can’t wait as long as I can. Some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same thing to them what I say to everybody who asked me about being patient. You have to be born with patient. Its not something you learn over the years. I could want three week without getting paid from my dad. As some people get older there grow lesser. That doesn’t work on everybody. But sometime soon I know my patient will be like everyone else when I get older. Who knows maybe somebody might be more patient than me I the world.
<START>

I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience I’ve had was hunting. You just have to sit there not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine o’clock at night. The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didn’t even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that nigh we went home really hungry.

A time when I was patient was when I ordered a @CAPS1 in the mail. It was a cool @DATE1 @TIME1, and I was ordering a @CAPS1 online. When I got to the shipping, I paid it, and went to the check-out screen. I saw the time of how long it would take to get to my house. It said @NUM1 weeks.”@CAPS3?!”I exclaimed.”That’s a long time.”@CAPS4 it was decided. I had to make through @NUM1 weeks. I was ready. @CAPS4 I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Until one @DATE2 I saw a @CAPS1. The address said “@CAPS6 @CAPS7”! I was @CAPS4 happy! This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, you’ll get @CAPS3 yar wanting in the end.

That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Lets go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to @LOCATION1. This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the @NUM1 children. When we finaly took off we were in turbulence the whole @NUM2 hour flight. Which ment we couldn’t get up, @CAPS1 food, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the @CAPS4! Flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops till we got to the @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a : memory I will never forget. The stuborn little smerk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her “chicken little.”

“@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1!” @PERSON2 said, “I wanna go first!” @CAPS2 the time in cheerleading this girl named @PERSON2 thought she was the first to do everything. Oh yeah my name is @PERSON3.

I’m always patient and wait my turn because I dont wanna complain or be a poor spot. “@CAPS3 set! @NUM1, @NUM2 down up @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6” the two bases and backspots yell. They pop @CAPS4 out and up thenscream “@CAPS5!” “@CAPS6 job.” @CAPS7 says. “@CAPS8, it’s my turn, @PERSON3, you can do this your better then her.” I thought to myself “@CAPS9 we can do this. “One of are bases @PERSON1 said. I get @CAPS3. Hand on shoulders @CAPS3 to get poped up into the air. Are other base @CAPS10 says “@NUM1, @NUM2 down up! Okay, @NUM3,@NUM4,@NUM5,@NUM6- @CAPS5!” “@CAPS6 job @CAPS12!” @CAPS13 cheers but loss. “I was so excited, “I just did a pop @CAPS5 without messing up my @CAPS5.” I thought with excitement. Being patient might be @CAPS6 after @CAPS2. From that day on I’ve always be patient. It can really help you out so you know what you have to work on or work less on.

Are you good with being patient? Sometimes I am but sometimes @CAPS1 not @CAPS2 going to tell you a story when I was patient when @CAPS1 normally not patient in situations like this. I had want to school with my mom so she can take a test @CAPS4 drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting I was texting and on the internet, @CAPS4 my stomach started to rumble, I was hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her rush so I can get something to eat as I was texting I stopped and thought about what was I about to do. I knew @CAPS5 hard long she had studied for that test. I didn`t want her to get a bad grade so I just sat there. I texted people. People called me so my mind was off food. After my mom finished her test she came out the room. I asked her “@CAPS5 did it go?” she looked at me smiled and said “I felt confident, but know @CAPS1 hungry I shouted out “me to” we got in the car and went to subway. I had got the forest now meal. With cooking, chips, and a drink it was delicious. My mom had dropped me off at the mall I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. @CAPS4 we went @ORGANIZATION1, charlete, @CAPS7, @PERSON1 and others places as well. After I thought about it I never want to do that again. I was starting and my but started to hurt. I sat there for @NUM1 hours with nothing to do never again will I do that. At least I had bounding rime with my mom. That’s one bright side.

In conclusion I learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life.

Don't you ever whis ever one in the world would be patience, @CAPS4 if you don't I do. Lucky   for me one time I was a not so good girl and I did something I was not suppos to do, but since I have such grate parent they were trying there best to be patience with me, like all parent they had to give me a lecksore about what I did, but they did not let me got out of the hock that easy. "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 please come down to the office" I herd on the anoament, @CAPS6 I was walking down one hallway I was really??? "what have I done" I ask myself, I was thinking really hard. By no time I was at the office "yes" I said to the person that was there "Do you now why your hear" @CAPS3 said "no" I replayed. "@CAPS4 I been having some complain from these  girl" @CAPS3 had told me "@CAPS4 oo ya" I said "@CAPS4 ya what" @CAPS3 said "was the only reason why I was bing mean was because they were bing mean and they were bing so suck up they would tell my friends that the only reason I hanged out with them was because they had money wich was not true" I said "ok I get were your comeing from, let me call them down" @CAPS3 said." @CAPS5 and alesay come down to the office please." @CAPS6 they came down the hallway I could hear there foot step. I really did not want to talk to them to be contined.

One thing I am not very at ient with is the meap. The reason I am not patient with the meap because it is very boring you can not talk and it is dull. I hate the meap it is very difficult, you don’t see tenn see or @CAPS1 doing the meap. The meap expect you to do to much work the meap is one of the reason I dislike michgan. The meap asking you questions and words you never saw or herd before. In my opinion @CAPS2 we are going to do meap I wou ld prefer them to ask question and words that we know. Another thing I dont like about it is that they grade our writing on opinion they grade of what they think of it. To mi the meap is stupid @CAPS2 I had a choice I would chose not to do it. Since the meap is important I do it for my grade. These are the reason why I am very inpatient with the meap.

A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 come and I was opening my present’s there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the day’s got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest @NUM2 months ever I didn’t even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater @DATE2 went by it was finally @DATE1 but I didn’t get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and app’s and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. That’s why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision that’s the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but it’s some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..I’m happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. That’s why??? can play it because I’m saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one.

The first time I baby sat was with @NUM1 little girls. A toddler named @PERSON1 and a baby named @CAPS1. After their parents left, everything was fine. That is, @CAPS4 @CAPS1 started crying like crazy. At first, I thought she was saying, “@CAPS3, @CAPS3!” @CAPS4 I realized she was saying, “@CAPS5, @CAPS5!”. Her @CAPS5 is a blanket and when I handed it to her, she stopped immeadiently! Now I realize how patient I was with her. I’m glad I figured out what she wanted. Hopefully, next time I’ll be just as patient.

Patience is a special skill for some people and some its very hard. When I was a little girl I was never had any patience and even now. I do not have any either but my friend was always patient for me yah she would tell me to hurry up or lll leave but I would just start laughing and come down right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and jekc it to the pound that’s what she would always do to. Patience I will probebly never lean till @CAPS1 like older but I know I will learn it someday. One time my friend waited for @NUM1 hours just to learn about history I would have never learned that my but then again she did get ??? ???? on her @CAPS2 homework. so her patience for that was like really cool and she told me that patience is a number one priority. his was one time my friend had patience.

It was a bright sunny day and there was a long line outside the airport. People were waiting for their flight to @LOCATION1. It has been three hours and everyone was getting impatient, but there was a young little boy in the group that didn’t seem to complain, he was very patient. Now it has to be five hours, their flight has been delayed, the sun went down, and there was a riot going on, but still the little young boy was still waiting patiently. It has now been twelve hours, people begain to leave, it was midnight, and yet the boy was still waiting there and has not yet move. Now there was only fifteen people left, it was dusk, and yet the boy waited there patiently. There flight has arrived and only there was three people there. They went in the plane. The other people that left saw the plane ready to take off and ran towared it. But they were too late and the only people who made it to @LOCATION1 was the two girls and the patient boy. The end.

Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patiences was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldn’t think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience.

This was one day when I had to do something that I didn’t want to do and if I didn’t do it I couldn’t go no were or go to the movies. When I was at my aunt house an I had to clean up her house an I didn’t want to do it so she had told me that her house should be clean when she come back home an I was the only one there. When I went to @CAPS1 point everybody went on this scary high in the sky ride an you have  to take your shoes of than we got something to eat.

The time that I was patient was today when everyone was takeing the @CAPS1.E.A.P. when we all get into the classroom nobody what so ever did not want to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P, when our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and on @DATE1 we had to finish part two of the writing session, nobody wanted to. So when we got the  paket that we had to bubble in our answers we had to fill something out on the front of the paket. Then we had to put our first and last name on it befour we could take a break. When the break was over we needed to get a n free reading book and our teacher had to read all of us the directions to us we ,got started and when everyone was finished she told like five or more people that they could have a bathroom break, when everyone went she read the directions to the other part and when everyone was doing that same people got done really early and they got really board and they didn’t want to read so then they all started to talk she would be right back that she had to go to the bathroom so once someone to came in and would wach us then all of the guys would make paper basket balls and started to shot them into into the tiny basket ball hoope and then she came in and told us to get in our seats and that we  would be starting the last writing sesson and that after this it would be lunch and it might even go though or lunch and then everyone was  freaking out. So that was the time that I was just patient.

One time when I had to be patient was when I went to my first nascar race. I had to be patient because there wer a lot of people there on I didn`t want to get last. An I had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats. Second- we finally got our seats an I had to sit by this scary person he was weird so the race was beginning an you could tell because the racers were getting into there cars. The jets went over us and the @ORGANIZATION1 was going. Then the racers were off to race. Finally the race a starts on my favorite racer is in the lead (@PERSON1). The cars were going so fast around like you could feel the bleachers shake. It was a fun exsperense but you had stay close is listen and be patient.

I am never paitent, but which I am it is only once and a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I’m doing nothing and it is really quiet. I get really bad headaches. In school for example and I’m waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ???everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. When I wait to long I feel lazy and tired because I’m not moving at all. I get buggy when I’m paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can’t be paitent very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is playing sports and doing things constantive.

Patience is when a being shows the ability to wait and make good desisons fo me, patience is the ability to stay calm, patience is very important because it alows me to ratinoly deel with suituations so that I @MONTH1 not get into trouble: @CAPS1 patience in times of stress is dificult. It is dificult beacause people are giving you greit. without @CAPS1 patience people make bad dessisons, this leads to bad things hapening. Paitence lets me deal with bad ideas like the @CAPS2’@CAPS3. by using paitence, I can deal with the problem and then move on @CAPS2’@CAPS3 are a very bad idea

It was the night before @CAPS1 eve and I couldn’t hardly wait. In @CAPS5 family on @CAPS1 eve we go to @CAPS5 grandparents house. When we are there we talk, eat, and @CAPS5 favorite open presents. As @CAPS5 mom, dad, and I drove up to @CAPS5 grandparents house I couldn’t open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the door bell a hundred times. “@CAPS3 hello there, @CAPS4” @CAPS5 grandpa said. “@CAPS6, can we eat fast so I can open @CAPS5 presents?” “yah, sure.” @CAPS7 we were done eating I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I couldn’t wait. As I waited patiently until all of @CAPS5 old relatives opened their presents it was finally @CAPS5 turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw what it was a game. Since it was the first present I had to open it fast but from then on I waited paitently until it was @CAPS5 turn.

When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn’t put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didn’t know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasn’t patient in this game we wouldn’t have won and I wouldn’t have gotten the trophy to take home with me.

My mom has very little patience, that’s way it surprised me when she had a whole bunch the day my grandma passed away. I was amazed she was sad but took her time carefully and slowly as if every move she made had to be perfect. It was a terrible day and all any of us wanted to do was cry. My mom knew that my grandma would want her to be happy, that’s why she watched her every move. As soon as I got there she came right up to me and gave me a huge hug and no matter what my little brother and I did she didn’t even mind. That was a very surprising day because I had never in my life seen her that sad but yet so patient.

A time that I was patient is when I had my twelth birthday. All of my friends exept one, wanted to keep playing. So we did. We desited to go and walk the dogs, and then have dinner, and then open presints. When we were all done with that, we opend my presints, I was very excited to see them. That is a time that I was patient. I was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first. Pluss in the end, I got a lot of exiting stuff and I relized that wating, and doing what my friends wanted to do first was a great idea. I’m pretty schure that we all had a great time.

When they got to the house @PERSON1 was screaming and crying they all got in the car and drove to the doctors. The nurse said that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 wasn’t patient until her and her friend were talking. When the doctor was ready to see her she had forgot all about why she was there, @PERSON1 found out that she broke her arm. Later that day she thanked her mom and then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient.

I thought that when I got hurt during football and was on a stretcher, everyone was patient. They understood that I could only go a cartair spare and waited for me in the hallways and carried my stud from room to room.

We sat for @NUM1 minutes band then we hear the doctor calling my name. We go inside the doctors room and I sit down he does all this things. Later he yells us that we have to meet one more doctor. We sat down again and we waited. Then we hear my name again so we go. The worst thing was that I saw a medicine on the table and I was really scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that she took the medicine and was going through it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she through the medicine in my eyes it burned a little. I didn`t want her to do the other. I wanted to just stand up and run outside, but I couldn`t she did the other eye and told me to now keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back she me that was it, and we were done there. I thought to myself, that wasn`t so bad.

Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don’t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don’t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should’nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don’t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.

Patient, that’s all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing.

Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it. During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone. So she was phoneless for aleast three months. She was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. She was so glad, she had more apps then the first @CAPS1 and a webcom. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldn’t be able to wait that long.

“@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!” my poms coach @PERSON1 says as we practice the dance over and over again. I love poms but at times it gets very tiring. We have practice @DATE1, and @DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45 pm and they didn’t even start until @NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didn’t get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickely we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldn’t believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced “@CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom pon team” then our names over the speakers. The crowed roared as we entered the field. We quickley all reminded our self to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents. After we finished we were automatically huttled around by friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasn’t so bad anymore.  It was all worth the wait.

When dealing with todlers or the elderly you must have patience. This patience is key when dealing with anyone, but very young and very old need more. Elderly often @MONTH1 become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you. You must practice patience and give them respect. Very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them to is you have no patience with them and start to yell, Patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons. If they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it. Mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers. Be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks @MONTH1 be hard for them to complete. Be patient with everyone because patience is respect. Fear is not respect. That is how I feel about the word patience.

A time when I was pacient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was  babysitting were acting up. It hard for me to get them to calm down. But , I noticed that if I was pacient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be pacient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being pacient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being  a lot when  I was babysitting them the next time too.

“@CAPS1 back harder on the reighns!” my teacher yelled “@CAPS2 trying, but hes @CAPS8 not listening!” @CAPS3 had to be the most stubborn horse I had @CAPS13 ridden in my life! @CAPS6 did whatever @CAPS6 wanted, whenever @CAPS6 wanted, and payed no attention to me at all. “@CAPS4, @CAPS4 @CAPS8 bring him in.” @CAPS6 said I slowly walked the horse into the center of the ring. “@PERSON1, I really am trying, hes @CAPS8 not listening.” I said “I know @CAPS6 can be a bit hard-headed but I make you ride him because I believe you can handle him.” @CAPS3 horses name was @PERSON3, @CAPS6 was a reddish-brownish color with big glassy brown eyes. @CAPS6 looked like a great horse that listened to its rider. Wrong! @CAPS6 was not nice or sweet and didnt listen at all! “@CAPS8 walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter.” @PERSON1 said. “@CAPS4 fine.” I replied. @CAPS8 as I was halfway around the ring, @PERSON3 stopped. Then @CAPS6 turned to his right, walked up to the window and started licking the water that beaded up on it. “@PERSON2! What is @CAPS6 doing!” @PERSON1 yelled “I think @CAPS6 is licking the water off the windows.” I said “@CAPS10 get him away from there, @CAPS6 could get sick!” @CAPS4, as I said earlier, @CAPS3 horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! “@CAPS8 be patient @PERSON2.” I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed a little and continued riding with no problems. I guess I @CAPS8 needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse @CAPS13 again.

On my way to @LOCATION1 to visit my dad. While in the car there is food and I brought along my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 to keep me busy, I brought my @CAPS1 along because it would be annoying if I ask are we there yet?” very @NUM1 minutes, and I knew that a @NUM2 hr drive would need some intertament. Most of the time I would be playing games so time goes by fast, if I don’t play games then I eat a snack, play with my baby cusihs, @PERSON1, and sleep. After awhile of that I sit back and relax. The whole trip is @NUM2 hrs but by doing all that it seems to be more like @NUM4 or @NUM5 hrs.

It is quite peaceful thowe that I'm off school and I @CAPS2 to spend time with my parents. Then in school I have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over. So @CAPS1 sit there until the sudden noise of on of our bobbers sinking into the water. After that theres some yelling and "@CAPS2 the net "sayings. The funny. Part is that it is that it is ethier a large bass or a small nor there. And all this takes patience.

One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister in law to tell my brother to tell us we could come in the hospital room and see their brand new baby @CAPS1. My father and mother were waiting with my sister, bother and I, in the waiting room / lobby. At the time it was probably for an hour and a half waiting. I guess that I could say that I was being patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I would have to get up and walk around. I was so shaky nervous and jumpy. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and right before rushed to the time I was being patient.

Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. I’ve been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line. A half hour past and it was five minutes til’ closing time. I get to the window and pay for my things @NUM1 minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing. The owner of the store let me get a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind.

Well you need patience when your fishing and whe your food is comeing or going to be served to you but also be patient with everybody else.

Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. “@CAPS1’s that?” I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2’t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “ro” and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom.

Once apoon a time there was a place called unpaciente land. But on grumpy lane lived a little girl namend @ORGANIZATION1. She was the most patient girl ever. One day @ORGANIZATION1 went to get her hair cut “at mtso fast saloon!” When @ORGANIZATION1 got there everyone was screaming at @CAPS1 the hair cutter and @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said hey if you want your hair to look good sit down and be quiet and everybody did. @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a beautiful haircut just like everybody else and then @ORGANIZATION1 because the mayor of unpaciente  land renamed it @CAPS2 land from that day forward every body was pacient.

A Time when I was Patient  A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step mom & brother. He was getting his knee looked at; @CAPS1 were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually I’m not very patient usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that I’m really impatient. For some reason when I’m really excited I’m fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient.

One time I was patient. It was dec @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 eve. I was so excited that @CAPS1. On @CAPS1 eve morning I slept till @NUM2 I wanted to?? To come. I was patient so I played video games not thinking about @CAPS1. When I went to the store I seen all the @CAPS1 things. I felt like I could’t wait no longer. That night after dinner I found that I wanted to stay instead of going to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep but I also wanted to stay up. I made some more food and went to sleep. When morning came I was so happy I ran into the living room. Sure enough there was the presents. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some to @NUM3 came and I wanted to open them so??? I knew it would’t be right so I went to sleep??? At noon I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom and dad and my brother were there, I opened my presents like a lion feasting on a gazelle, I was so happy I waited.

When I was patient I had no fears no argument but I had a good deal .I had a @CAPS1  @CAPS4 was so good my sister @PERSON1 said “@CAPS2 I get some”  I said “ @CAPS3 you @CAPS2” @CAPS4 was a miracle so I was driving her car at the gasstation .I went to @ORGANIZATION1 .I said ,”@NUM1 @CAPS5 please “ @CAPS4 was a cousin of mine and she said ,” @NUM2 days ago “ I was like “ wow “ @PERSON1 called my phone because @CAPS4 was my daddy’s weekend she said ,” get down there now I was like  wow.

A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 took a few hours so here is @CAPS2 story. We were leaving the house when I realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog penny [she is real not fake] @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house and rest. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. “@CAPS1’s gonna be a long ride” I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Daring @CAPS2 nap @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasn’t nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned his gos and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.

There’s many times I’ve been patient @CAPS1 this one time, my little sister kept buging me, and I didn’t scream at her or hit her. She was asking me to turn on the music and I said “no”, she through a fit. So I got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she get hit, in a nice and kind voice. And she stopped. And I told her to sit down and be quiet and watch tv. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was desterbing me. I didn’t become a mean person at that point. Last but not least that was a time that I was a patient person.

Patience for me is when im helping others with their problems so in this story im going describe to you what is patience. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl she was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying the way she doesn’t want to be at home because he mom don’t let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.

There was a time I was patient for a whole day! It was @CAPS1 eve and it was about @NUM1, meaning I just woke up, I ate breakfast brush my teeth after I got out of the shower.

He sewried down the stairs and right to the canter. As I start walking down the stairs I hear a @CAPS3!! So I start running down the stairs as fast as I could knowing my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They meet @CAPS7 at the counter and ask @CAPS7. “@CAPS4 many times have you ask to open a present?” “@CAPS5” I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2 about @NUM5 minutes later I was done watch @CAPS6.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day.

I showed patience before. I am about to tell you and that time. Two years ago.  I worked at my @CAPS1’s home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ???  he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1 that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing. “I know but you deserve it.” I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off.

When I was about nine years old. I took my homework home with me. I showed one of my older brothers, my homework. He look at it then he started helping me with it. Then he did a couple of answers. To show me what I had to do because I didn’t really know how to do my homework. So he had to do his homework so he told me to do my home work. So I started to do my homework I did all of my questions correct. But it was a realy hard question on it. T wanted to ask my older brother. But instead I didn’t do that because he was doing his work. So I did it myself.

Middleton middle school, I’m one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, I’m new here, but you @MONTH1 think that I’m a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 I’m not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1’s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 said. “my name’s @CAPS4.” @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. “@CAPS2.” I said back. “I’m @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.” “@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1.” @CAPS4 replied. “@CAPS11 let me show you around.” “@CAPS12!” I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boy’s name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just woulden’t let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, “@CAPS13’s @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.” “@CAPS15?” @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 coulden’t do same thing. “@CAPS16 you just don’t have any patience!” I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 coulden’t understand. “@CAPS17 be that way  @CAPS1!” @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. “@CAPS4 wait!” I cried but I hat to run after her. “@CAPS20, please you don’t get @CAPS13. You can’t keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before?” I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. “@CAPS21.” @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again.

I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1’s gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said “@CAPS6’re leaking trannie fluid.” @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). “@CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip” I said to @CAPS2, “@CAPS6 don’t know that for sure” he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didn’t help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 weren’t sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said “were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car.

When I went deer hunting with my dad I was patient. When me and my dad went deer hunting I had to be patint by waiting. The hardest part was being quiet to. I also had to stay still.

Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m deticated, I’ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I’ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!

But when is saw the dunes I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did. After I got to the top. I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like, a dead animal. After five minute I was good and climbing to the top dune off because after I got up I ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop I stop I stoped. But I got seed in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell, when my friend carte down we both lauphed and @CAPS2 back to our campsite.

My name is @CAPS1 and I’m writing about a time I had be patient. It was a nice @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE2 it was the eighteenth and we were going to drive down to @LOCATION1 for a vaction we were going to  @CAPS2 land. Everybody was up in the house hold packing every thing into a hammer that we rented for the trip so every one would fite into the car. We had packed all things into the car. My made us a good breakfast. A hearty meal of sasauge pancakes and bacon and scaldded eggs. It was delicouse. After that we got into the car and we were on the highway I had fell a sleep a hour into the drive. By now it was ten acloak at night and I woke back up. My sister was yelling at my brother and then me and my sister got into a urgement my told all of use to be quited and we did but we were all get on each other nerves. And I had to be patient for another two day but we got there and I was glad to be there so overall it was a funture till we had to go back.

I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my for-wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home exept for my grandma, my dad don’t want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not their. At that point I was inpatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. So I called my dad and he said it was @CAPS1 if my uncle @PERSON1 said it was fine with him. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore.

I have bell weight in for eight months to get A new calf but I didn't them were I would get one untill I asked my uncle who cases @CAPS1's small cow breed witch nor mail costs @MONEY2 but he gave me a deal on her for @MONEY1. It took me eight month's to fined he. But daring those eight month's I got tenacious and I couldn't sleep very well at high that when I got her home I was happy I had found her when I did. I still wory about her at night because of the cougar that is rooming the cluntury side.

Do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? Well, I don’t also ??? Well I am going to tell you about a time when I was inpatient and patient. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get in the bus stop @NUM1 min early, so I can talk with my mother ??? Try I got up to early. I made it to the bus stop early. ??? @NUM2 min later I decided to go back home. By the time I got home I was going to be late. I hurried at the door, but I was too late, the bus was gone. I should have more patient. On day I was going to burger ??? was to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster. When I got their, their where about @NUM3 peace in their, so I decided to wait my turn in line like I had later. I was there people payed from cash regester. I was finally their I ordered my burger when I was done it was worth the wait. In conclusion you have to be patient in everything you do. Sports, school or home and even in public, I hope my story made you relise how important it is to be patient.
<START>

A time I was patient was in @DATE1 at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was about @NUM1 in the @TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes till the first @PERSON1 came on stage, the name of their @PERSON1 was @LOCATION2. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock @PERSON1. But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next @PERSON1 was one I new lots about; their name is the @PERSON1, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was @PERSON2, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about @LOCATION1 and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named @CAPS3. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did @NUM4?, and a @NUM5. It went @NUM2 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can @CAPS4. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about @NUM7 it was amazing. I will probly never whiteness something like that ever again!
<START>

Being patient is hard sometimes but easy others. Like @CAPS1 for example. I always get up really early on @CAPS1 morning and lay on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up round @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about @NUM2 am we start getting gosy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About @NUM3 am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about @NUM4 min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end.
<START>

When l was patient l was in the car and my mom went to get something at the store and l went whith her. I was patient because l didn’t tell her when are we gonna go home or this is @CAPS1 boring. I tried to go whith the flow. I was there for @NUM1 hour but did I care no because l was the one who wanted to come whith and l came. If l would of complained then she would of said then “why did you come.” @CAPS1 at the end my mom said since you have been patient then you can get a chocolate bar @CAPS1 if your patient, there might be a reward at the end.
<START>

When I was very patient was the, time I had to get my teeth pulled it had took two hours they would take a break for about @NUM1 minutes every half an hour I had gotten  many shots in my mouth. And they had ripped my gum open and took at two teeth. Then my two bottom teeth. I was patentance then. They even said I was one of there best kids cause of every thing I had went thorugh in my mouth and the long time panke. This was the time I got @NUM2 teeth pulled and was very patient.
<START>

“When can I drive?” I wined. “when the time comes you have to be patient, otherwise you won’t yelled my @CAPS1 over the loud, heart warming sound of @CAPS2. Starting up for the @NUM1 time that year. I loved that sound. It’s my second favorite sound. The vibrations rattaling my lags as it races away with @PERSON1 driving. I could wait until my turn. After I rides and @NUM2 mins. @CAPS1 said the words I thought he’d never say,” @CAPS3, your turn.” I looked at him then the truck. Wow does he look small next to that truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climed onto the tires rim, then to the, top of the tire, and into the cab. “@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, gaggag @CAPS7. Oh yeah! This felt right. I couldn’t go fast but I almost tipped it over. So that’s a good thing. So all in a nat shell, paconts comes a long way.
<START>

I don’t have much patience, but I’ll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was @DATE1 after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to landslide skate park. We were all at my home but @CAPS1 wasn’t. My mom said “@CAPS2 hes not here in two minutes we have to go with out him”. So I was mad I was writing a note to put on the door that reads “@CAPS1, we had to go with out you because you were late! Sorry be on time next time.-@CAPS4”. But when I was signing the note he pulled up. That was the story when I had patients.
<START>

One time in @DATE1, I was taking a test called the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS1). Me, and my friends get down with the @ORGANIZATION1 early. So we had to be patient too. We had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @NUM1 minutes have gone by, sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace. One time me, and my dad were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like a few weeks. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal. A bad patience is when you’re late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves. So you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace. @ORGANIZATION1.

When I was around the age @NUM1. I went to @CAPS1 with my grandpa, grandma, and mom, and dad for a family reunen, we stoped so menny times I cant even count. I think it was to but I did not want to stop or be patient because I wanted to get there and see what everything looked like like it was big but the dad post was we hade to leave are dog home for a week, was in patient to get home to because as soon as I got home I was going to sleep. We got up to leave from are house at @TIME1 and we got to the motel at @TIME2 am the after noon I was sick of sitting in the car I did not want to get back in the car to go home because if you think of it that is long ways to white in the car. I was very impatient because if I could of gotten there in a half of a hour or a have would have been a lot better than like, @NUM2 hours of time but it was a lot of fun to see new things that you have never seen befor on your way there because on are way home. I was just sleeping. But I was not very patient I was so board that every stop I would switch cars and I did not have tating at that time but I did have my @CAPS2 until it died then I made my I pod and my cells all I could do was call and play games on that but I was so impatient at the coner to cuzz I rather go to the hotel and sleep than sit there lission to older people talk bout what has happened. I don’t know hardly any of them I could not tell you who every one was.
<START>

I was patient this one time while waiting to get on the computers and I told my mom to wake me if she gets oyr the computer and after an hour I fell asleep and I woke up after a little while and my brother was on for three hours reading manag we already have and after three minutes my dad kicked me off to check his email and he said he would be off soon yet he spent the rest of the day a  hit more of the next day watching indearath  star(for six hours even though he spends eight hours on a connecting at work so that adds @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the internet everyday of the year.
<START>

There was this guy that I liked a lot that I finally had the courage to ask out after @NUM1 years and @NUM2 ½ weeks. He said yes to go to the dance with me but no to going out. So a little while later like a week later I asked him again. He told me give him till the end of the week. So I waited and waited and on and on it seemed like forever. Then my friend just couldn’t take it she asked him on @DATE1 and he said yes! A million yes, joy came from his mouth. Then @DATE2, after getting to know me better he broke up with me. We have been fighting ever since, but were still besties!

Being patient is hard and not all people are patient, but patience is an important thing to do. You have to be patient almost everywhere you go, like waiting in line is being patient. You have to be patient with people to, like people who are learning or you are teaching. I was patient in @ORGANIZATION1 which was really hard to do. When I was really little mabey four or five years old, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to go on a ride but I couldn’t go because I was to short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @CAPS1 went on the ride. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not get antcy. After a while I started asking “When is the ride going to be over mama” she kept responding “I don’t know, when ever @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 get off the ride.” @CAPS2 I couldn’t wait, but when my @CAPS1 and sister got off they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said “ok” and thats when I got sad then she said to me “but because you waited so long and nicely I will take you to get a smoothy.” “I love smoothys” I scream. Patience is important, because I was so patient my mom got me something I love. Patience ia a hard thing to do but once you got it, it’s a good thing to do.

Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up wen she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too. She put on my chest to see if my heart was @CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks "what's going on here". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine. So i trusted her she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm it sorta hurt like a pinch then @NUM2… @NUM3… @NUM4… and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube really cool then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which  took about a year not really could not tell by her expression then she said no and that was so happy and I was being patient which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and seeing myself!
<START>

“When do ve get the xbox!” I asked @CAPS1. “@CAPS2 hours,” he replied. “@CAPS3!” “yes.” “@CAPS4.” “@CAPS4.” @CAPS2 hours…. I thought, this is gonna feel like a week. First, I got on the computer. After ten minutes I got off because nothing was ???. Next I looked at the t.v guide. Nothing. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I did…, I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide still nothing. I just turned the t.v on. A @PERSON1 just ended. “@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1,” the @CAPS8 commercial said. “@CAPS10 see this,” I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought. It was a no color @PERSON1 that was about a police official and his son. After watching four hours of the @PERSON1, I heard the goings door open. I heard @CAPS1 come in and say, “@CAPS12 got it!” @CAPS13 then I said, “@CAPS14,” and then fell asleep. “@CAPS15 wake him up.” @CAPS1 whispered.

One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and lisksent through difficultis without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day end at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that ment the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasn’t coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a bird’s eye  of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. Finally,, he got a ride. Each ride got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience.

On @DATE1 we went to the doller tree I want to go to the game stop. But I was patient then we went to the game stop.

In the beginning, I woke up from sleeping and felt real sick, @CAPS1 I took a shower and put on my clothes. I told my dad “can I go to the doctor because I feel sick?”??? @CAPS1 he said “we will leave @NUM1 am” and it was @NUM2 am. Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad and my mom were talking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and tried acting @CAPS1 beautiful. @CAPS1 I didn’t. When they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was @NUM3 am and my dad’s favorite music was on @CAPS1 we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle, it was @NUM4 am and then we went to the doctor and had to stay waiting for everyone to get there turn until it was @NUM5 which is our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me and it was nothing. @CAPS1 I left and I still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was @CAPS1 pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said “Are you happy? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you.” @CAPS1 we went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself “I learned my lesson and it is if you are patient the day can go fast.”
<START>

Over the @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 to visit my aunt @CAPS1.  @CAPS2 got up early and drove to @LOCATION4 I was the firts time I was going to go on a plane. My dad said I better have patients or else the ride was going to be boring me and my sister got on the plane and flew to @LOCATION3 and it took @NUM1 minutes and that was easy but then @CAPS2 got on another plane and went directly to @PERSON1 and that took @NUM2 hours I was a very long ride but I had patient, but my sister didn't have any patients at all the whole ride she was asking which @CAPS2 were going to get there. And that was the time, I had patients.

I was patient when I was going to cedar point. We took a bas it took seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided in watch movies on the @CAPS2. We watched street dreams and the incredible. We were still a long way from cedar point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilerious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait now longer. This helped in my future.

I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I new then when every one got done we waited for @NUM1 min then we start the meap again when I got done with that noone else was done so I waited for @NUM2 or @NUM3 min then every one was done then we stretched walked around for @NUM4 min then we sit back down and start the part @NUM5 when we are done we get to do work I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on my tests like meap test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.

On my last trip at @CAPS1 point I made a horrible mistake. I waited in line for @NUM1 hours on the mantis. I had to be patient, but it was hard to because… the mister fans were having tecinal diffucatties . And how can I be patient when it is @NUM2 degrees outside?! The only good part of the line was the shade. That was @NUM3 way I kept my patience." I told my self, "and in no time you will be there." @CAPS2 I spoke too soon. Half an hour seemed like @NUM4 hours, but I think the heat was just getting to me. Finally, after @NUM5 hours in line the mist fans @DATE1 to lift. Patience can bring luck. I wait for what seems like only ten minutes but accaully was an hour. After I got off the ride, I was releaved. I guess patience in some ways, is the key to success.

One day a man named @PERSON1 had a doctor’s appointment and over slept; when @PERSON1 got out of bed he saw that he was late for his doctor’s appointment. As @PERSON1 got out of bed he rushed in the bathroom to take a quick shower, as if he had time. @PERSON1 noticed   it was grilling later so he didn’t get to wash up or brush his teeth, so he grabbed a part of gum on the way out the door. @PERSON1 finally got to the doctors went inside and saw there were millions of people in the waiting  room, he went to go check his name in and sat down. He started to get frustrated and tired   of waiting, so he calmed down and realized patience. @PERSON1 kept his self busy for two whole hours playing with his phone and many apps he downloaded. @PERSON1 was so busy he didn’t realize that he was the last person still waiting. Other people had their check-ups and left and others just left without theirs. Finally, they called   in @LOCATION1 for his appointment. As @PERSON1 was going in he put @NUM1, maybe @NUM2 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @PERSON1 was done, zoomed home, flew into his the shower, and brushed his teeth, got back in the bed and went to sleep.

Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: t cannot wait for things. During school, I am always looking at the clock. I just can’t wait for class to be over most of the time. Some times I think I rush things a little bit too much. I wish I was patient, but I’m not. I’m not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting, I get too curious. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style. I don’t think that will happen anytime soon.

Patience is very important at my house. My mother always says you have to be able to patient to succed in anything. One time I was at home on the computer. I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair. Walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to @CAPS1 to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make myself a sanawich. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room. Folder laundry and watched television. It was about @DATE1 and she still wasn’t home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says be patient to succed. About a half an hour @DATE1 she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it.

Patients in my way of saying is a person that waits awile if she needed to. The only reason im putting this in my own way is because know one is patient in my family. Pations is s person where if they were stuck in traffic then they’ll be able to sit and wait or there’s a really long wait or line. Or they’ll be able to wait for something they need. Patients is just waiting for my turn I should put it. Its about waiting if I have to or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. That’s what patients mean to me in my own way.

I am going to tell you about a time I was impatient. I had been working everyday in the @DATE1. I was trying to do the best I could to make make money. I was saving up to by a three hundred dollar bow, a firty dollar target, forty dollar broadbands, and other hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday. Slowly I was getting tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it. Finally I saved up enough money. I bought my stuff. I practiced all day long. Soon I became more accurate. I was ready to go hunting. The first night I was out I passed up a doe at eight yards. I haven’t had anything close enough to shoot since then.
<START>

One time when I was patient was when the shot flew was going around. I had to go to this one place to get the flew shots. When we got there we got in line, I had to be patient because the line was really long is??? the line to get through. We brought chairs, hot coce and staff to do to keep us any feet. I had to be patient in tell I got on to the front of the line. The worse part was that most of the tide was outside and it was @CAPS1 eve, so I had to be patient in the cold, when we finally got inside the building I was so happy. Then about @DATE1 we got to the front of the line. I’m glad that I never have to wait in line for three hours to get a flew shot again.

One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didn’t happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldn’t stop. I went head-first  into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didn’t panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didn’t take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldn’t stop in time. When I hit my head it didn’t hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didn’t hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over.

I am a very patient person. An example are games. For some games you have to wait weeks, or months. For others you might have to wait years. I have done this before.

I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 for this @DATE1. The line must have at least @NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchard in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 second. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. I’m sorry. Thanks for your cooperation” click. I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! It’s time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9!” That was my story of being patient.

Waiting for my child was the longest @NUM1 hours of my life. I had been in the waiting room for nearly the whole time. The nurses kept giving me updates, to calm me, to no avail. So I @CAPS1 out a smoke to ease my nerves. I didn’t know if my wife, or our baby would live. Would it live happy? I just @CAPS1 a puff of smoke, and waited for hours I sat, shutting out the rest of the world to shield my own thoughts. Would it be picked on? I sat, ignoring the nurses pleading, trying to reassure me. Would it shut life out? I sat, waiting for my newborn child. My silence was broken, by a baby crying. I rushed over to my wife’s room, to find her holding a beutiful baby girl. “@CAPS1 you long enough”

We were driving to @LOCATION1. My uncle lived there so since he always came to our house we were going to his new house. I was excited about going there, but there was one problem, it was over a ten hour drive. My parents woke me up the morning we were leaving and I felt so tired. I looked at the clock and it said six thirty a.m. I knew we weren't bringing a lot of food and things so we went to get packed up and in the van but it took longer that it seemed like it would last. My dad said we would leave around seven thirty but it was an hour more that we planned. We got all packed up and we were onthe road. It was about an hour in I fell asleep in the back seat. We made a stop an hour and @DATE1 and I woke up. After we got back me and my bother watched a movie on our portable dvd player. We kept driving there and I knew it would take a while but I kept my patience and fell asleep most of the time. When we got there @DATE1 it was great. Their house was up in a mountain, I had fan visiting them and we walked around town went into stores.  I had fun seeing my uncle and aunt. This was the time I was patient.

A time I was patience was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. adventures and we all wanted to go on the leaver water slide. The biggest water slide there. It had the longest line cher, it made a swerl and my family was at the end of the swerl. I was early morning when we had finally get in and went to the leaver water slide. It was huge just about @NUM1 feettall. And we got in line and only an half an hour had gone by when my mom let it. Then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. Now it was only my my other brother my sister, and my dad is left in line. When some one got hurt on the ride and the shut it down for two hours. Finally they opened up the ride again so now my other brother and sister did not come with us. So now it is only my dad and me left in the line now. So it was our turn on the ride next when my dad get scard end left so it was me and an old man went on the same little fletch. The old man met his pance and l was so happy to finally get on.

Patience is very important, it can help you be successful in many things. In school patience is very important because some things just have to wait. Being patience in the game of chess or checkers is important because while the other persons makes his or her move  you can be thinking of what move you will make to counter attack it. Patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork. Patience is also about waiting. For example, everyone is excited on @CAPS1 eve and can’t wait till morning but they have to be patient and wait till morning. Also on your birthday you don’t know what you’ll get but instead of peeking you have to be patient you can open the presents up. Patience is a very helpful skill to have

“@CAPS1! Today is the day we get to go to @CAPS2 point,” @CAPS3 @PERSON1 exclaimed. “@CAPS4 on @PERSON1, lets get this show at the road.” @CAPS5 announced. The @CAPS6 were planning a vacation to go to @CAPS7 point @CAPS22 @DATE1 long and today is the day they got to go. The family got @CAPS22 of their suitcases and piled them in the car. When everything was situated, they took off. “@CAPS8 @CAPS11, how long is this drive gonna take?” @CAPS9, @PERSON1’s older sister, asked.  “@CAPS10, about six hours sweetie.” @CAPS11 replied. The @CAPS6 lived in @LOCATION1, @CAPS21 they had to drive along way to get to @LOCATION2.“@CAPS13 @CAPS11!!! I can’t survive six hours in a car!!!. “@CAPS14 @CAPS9, you wanted to @CAPS4 here, you just have to have patience like @CAPS3 @PERSON1 here.”   “I guess I will not wait.” @CAPS15 about three hours in the car @CAPS9 kept repeatedly asking the question “Are we there yet?” @CAPS16 though the answer was always “@CAPS17,” she asked it anyways. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 eventually got annoyed of this and shouted “stop it! Just have some patience!”,“@CAPS18, @CAPS18,” @CAPS9 replied, “I will stop.”@CAPS15 about two more hours, they finally arrived. The parents bought the tickets and asked their children what ride they wanted to go on. They both smiled and said “The @CAPS20.”     @CAPS21 they walked up to the line, and waited. They just waited, and waited. Some more.  @CAPS15 what seemed like four hours waiting in line, @CAPS9 gave up and shouted “I don’t want to wait in line anymore! I am leaving!” @CAPS21 the family walked back into the car, and drove off. When they got settled, @PERSON1 told @CAPS9, “@CAPS22 it takes is some patience and you can have some fun.”  @CAPS9 didn’t respond.

One day @PERSON1’s mom, “@CAPS1” decited to go shoping and @PERSON1 despretly wanted to go. But his mom kept saying @CAPS2. So @PERSON1 begged and begged s his mom finally said, “@CAPS3 but you cant complain” so @PERSON1 went shoping with his mom. Then @PERSON1 and his mom arrived at the store. Just about @DATE1 @PERSON1 said. “I’m board can we go now”, his mom @CAPS4 @CAPS2 just be patient. @PERSON1 then said,” patient you want me to be patient weve been here for like  @DATE1 hours”, we have only been here for ten @DATE1. I have @CAPS2 more patients said @PERSON1. So so his mom made a deal with @PERSON1 it was, if you be good for @NUM1 more @DATE1 we will go to the ice cream place. The next @NUM1 @DATE1 made his mom go crazy with every second @PERSON1 saying, I’m board can we go now and hurry up. Finally @PERSON1 and his mom left. They got in the car and drove right past the ice cream place, @PERSON1 said, “wait” we past it, his mom said I know. @PERSON1 said” we made a deal, remember. It is mom said yup but you broke the deal, so what did you learn. @PERSON1 said that when you make a deal sign a contract, his mom said, “@CAPS2” patients is a virtue that you need to learn. So that is my story about patients in my own way.

A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient.

Patients is everything, ever hear these words! When you waiting in line for a test food restaurant, or when you stuck in a traffic. You’re annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind. “patient is everything,” one time I was waiting in the longer line ever waiting to see the ordering counter! I was in a rush, I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could we the counter I saw the empeloyees rushing around trying tralicly to get all the orders. Then I saw the reason of the holdap. There was an old man at the front of the line trying to despreately order. I didn’t blame him, wich all those choices, he didn’t know what to pick, the lost of the line wasn’t as patient, “harry up.” One said “come on.” @CAPS1 another I just waited patiently thinking, the line wasn’t really being fair. I suggested a choice for him and he ordered. Sure, I way @NUM1 minutes late for my class but I was patient and understanding towards the old man, what comes around goes around they say, rest of the day I felt good about my good deed

Are you always or even sometimes patient? If not your normal. @CAPS1-@CAPS1. But everyone on @LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help  you in the long run. I f you and I were patient our would would be a  little  bit fasier. Like  if your brother for an instint was in your bathroom and you had  to use it. you  could wait for him to finish. That is saving  argueing and it’s  being patient. I say these thing like “I’m patient!” but that would be  a lie, because I am far from it! Not saying it’s  easy but we all try.

@PERSON1 was a hamster. One day @PERSON1 was out of his cage playing with his owners’ sister hamster @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had just got a brand new hamster toy. @CAPS5 had a bunch of tubes to climb in and a slide and running wheel. @PERSON1 wished he had one, @CAPS1 his owner didn’t have enough money yet. Even when @PERSON1 play in his, he still wanted one. @CAPS5 was very hard for @PERSON1 to wait, especially when @PERSON1 saw @PERSON1 playing in his. This is the story of when @PERSON1 was talking ta @PERSON1, I really wish I had one of those hamster toys” said @PERSON1.” @CAPS1 my owner doesn’t have enough money!” “@CAPS2’t worry “said @PERSON1.” You can play in mine until he does. I hear he’s almost got enough.” “@CAPS3, I guess, that’s close enough. “A few days later, @PERSON1 got the brand new toy, never than @CAPS4, “I guess @CAPS5 was worth waiting!” @CAPS5 was twice as big than @PERSON1’s, so they could shore. And they both lived happily ever after.

Im not a very patient person so im going to be wrighting about what patience @CAPS6. Patience @CAPS6 when you don’t complain when your board or waiting for somthing. For example (for your convenance I @CAPS1 be wrighting a story about patience, please  take to note that this story @CAPS6 completely untrue) @CAPS1 was walking home and saw an elderly woman, she was having trouble with her grocerys. @CAPS1 wanted to help her but all he was thinking about was his cousin @CAPS2 that @CAPS4 be arriving at his house any moment now. @CAPS1 walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help and she replied “if you could I live over @CAPS3” she pointed to a large tan house. @CAPS1 carried her things to the door. “@CAPS3 you go,” he said. “@CAPS4 you mind helping me put them away” the woman asked. @CAPS1 thought about how his mother never wanted him to go into a strangers house, but @CAPS1 sort of knew her, so he said that he @CAPS4 help the woman smile. @CAPS1 then picked up the bags and said, “@CAPS6 your home unlocked” “@CAPS7 its not” she replied, where are your keys” @CAPS1 asked, “I beleve there lost somwere in the lawn. @CAPS1 searched for about a half hour, then he found them under a bush. He brought the keys to her and said “@CAPS3 you go,” she opened the door and he helped her with her grocres. When they were all put away @CAPS1 said “@CAPS11 I ought to be going.” “@CAPS11 not without somway I can repay you” said the woman “@CAPS13 go find my purse.” @CAPS1 waited and waited, it had to have been a hour. The woman came out of the kitchin with some change. “@CAPS15 its only change, I couldn’t find my wallet” she said and gave him the change. @CAPS1 left feeling like a good person because he was patient with the woman. @CAPS1 told his mom about his good deed and his cousin @CAPS2 got to stay longer. This was my example of patience, if this ever happens to you make sure your patient and know the person.

Someone l know that is patient is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people l know. Especially on this certain day. Every once and a while my brothers and sister and l are just kind of hard to handle. We where on our way to church when my brother and l started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason, we always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brothe and my sister where frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at me… she pinched me. Then we finally got to church l guess my mom figure it would stop once we got there, but no my three year old brother @PERSON1 repeatedly ran around and threw the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and l kept talking with my friends. I know l would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why l think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave.

One day at the fair I was patient. I wanted to ride the bumper cars. So I got in line. There where about @NUM1 people in front of me so I knew I had to be patient. So I waited in line until it was my turn. They let @NUM2 people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends so we let some people got in front of us. Then after @NUM3 minutes it was our turn we picked our car and had some fun. That's a time when I was patient.

During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didn’t know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didn’t know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didn’t say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who don’t know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes won’t go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since I’m not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didn’t once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didn’t yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldn’t have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I would’ve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. I’m amazed at my mom’s understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too.

One day when I went to the doctors to get shots my mom said I was very patient. My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flue shots like every other year when we got in the car to go I kept saying ‘’do we really have to go’’ of  course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit my mom had to get the papers so I just standed there and watched the fish swim around then my mom said ‘’lets go in the waiting room’’. After that she said I had been very patient for waiting except for in the car when I was whinning. So I said thanks and when are we going to get in there. Then when we finally get in there I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions the the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm she said you are like almost the only one of are kid patients that has it been patient. And that is the story of when I was patient.

Some people are patient. Others are not. Some have short attention spans.  Patience is a person who is understanding and tolerant. They experience difficulties without complaining. Some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something. They are not patient. There is a saying that goes, patience is a virtue. Many have heard of that. Patience is waiting for @NUM1 hours in line to see a movie and not having to move around. Patience isn’t pacing back and forth. Being patient in problems is fine.

Patience is the key to life some say. I don’t really know if it is or not. Patience is when your quite, you can wait for things. It is when you can do hardstuff with out feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties. Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. Patience does not lie, it makes things better when they are difficulty. It makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things.

When I think of being  patient I think about the time I went to southrend @LOCATION1 for hockey, we were on the road for @NUM1 ½ hours! While  we were on the way there i didn’t say one thing about how much longer or anything, although I was on a claster bus with all my hockey friends wathing a hockey movie. When I think of patients I think of wating without asking  “@CAPS1 it done yet?’’ or “Are we there yet?” I myself dont have the best patients. when I want the computer or to role the guard or frarwheeler and someone was on those things I tend to ask “when will he be dane!” alot. Patients grows with you when you develop, as you get older you will be able to wait longer times without getting stressed out about how everything takes so long even this test takes patients!

It all started on a cold and snowy @DATE1, there was only two days till @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights that are the colors of the rainbows. Also people are very happy around this time of year. I always become impatient waiting for @CAPS1 to @CAPS6. This year I was going to be patient. @CAPS4 I started being patient by going with my mom to go buy new light @CAPS1 tree, and to buy presents for my family. While we were shopping there were all kinds of people in the store. @CAPS4 when got to the checkout line there were a lot of people in line. My mom told me too be patient, @CAPS4 I did. When we finally got out of the store we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow up @LOCATION1 which was taking a very long time, but I had to be patient. Finally it @CAPS6 to making the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough and put them into the oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook. My mom said as patient can. ''@CAPS4 I was patient and the cookies were eventually all fasted with sprinkles on them. With everything made and put up we were ready for @CAPS1. ''@CAPS6 on @CAPS1,'' I said to myself. I need to be patient or @CAPS1 will never @CAPS6. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS10 everyone came over and had dinner with us, and got their presents I bought them. As everyone left I walked to my room not remembering that it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10. Then when I woke up late, and everyone was waiting for me I got excited: @CAPS13 I was patient and it payed off.

Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant. Well I’m going to tell you about someone who is patience. My friend @PERSON1 is very patience person. @PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her wait she listens and waits. When her parents were talking, and when she was trying to tell them something they told her to wait because it is rude when you interrupt adults when there talking. @PERSON1 is a very patience person.

A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I wanted my party to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no. @CAPS1 the party came I got all my presents’ exept the ones from my parents. They said @CAPS1 everyone left they would give them to me. But no one left till ten. So I fell asleep. When I wook up no one was up. So I still had to wait. (I hate waiting.) @CAPS1 my mum got up I asked if I could open my presents she said wait till your father gets up. @CAPS1 my dad finally got up (@NUM1) I finally got to open my presents.

Today was the day that the x-box @NUM2 came out and I wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running arch I could get it. As an hour past we arrived at the grcery state. I darted inside and grabbed a cart. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any ginks of being impatient. After what see made like hours we were done and the next stop was the library. I couldn’t do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quickly. It was already dark when we finally went to best buy to buy the x-box @NUM2. We went and got it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day.

When we become the plane we were an exited, @CAPS1 on gate were scattered all over. So I sat with my @NUM3 favorite friends in that trip. We were all loaded with as electicails the enemes. As we foot on I thought @CAPS3 was going to be a breeze, @CAPS1 thought wrong. At first @CAPS3 was fine we talkes and played games in our I pods and sort, @CAPS1 after like @NUM2 hours we started setting itchy and our I pods died. So then we decided to watch a movie as our mind dvd player. @CAPS3 was starling to irn low on battery and the plan was broken. The thing died and we still had like another @NUM2 hours and we only got to watch one movie. On the back of each seat there was a tv so we forced @CAPS3 on, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 was one of @NUM6 of the???did not ???. We started to see really??? and @CAPS3 was getting late. We didn't know what to do @CAPS3 was hopeless .We had to sit and wait if out sit was a true talk of patience. We??? @NUM3 home??? @CAPS3 was the longest @NUM3 horrs ever. We did nothing. @CAPS1 as we wanted we bolted out of our seats and into the air read @CAPS3 was over. We didn't have to be patient no longer.

Patients for me is hard but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didn’t have my physical. So while everyone was playing volleyball me and @NUM1 other people were sitting and watching for @NUM2 @DATE1!!!. I wasn’t vary patient then but @DATE1 on at the end of the tryouts my mom came to pick me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctors office thingy, so I could get my physical done. So me and my mom went in and she had to sign and fill out paper work because she didn’t make me all appointment. So that took about @NUM3 min. then we waited, and waited, and waited until @NUM4 and @DATE1 if you add that up this @NUM2 @DATE1 waiting there with nothing to do. I was patient but my mom definitely wasn’t. So finally they called me in and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for @NUM3 min. then finally they gave us the paper/ physical, and then we left. Practice ended at @NUM7 and we didn’t get home until @NUM8!!!. That is a time I was patient.

Once I was patient, I want to go they football with my dad but didn’t want to. So when he was puting shoe on when I would ask him to come play football he would take his shone off. Then I had to wait two and half hour just for him to get one shone on. When he was putting second shon I didn’t say anything so. We faihl when and play football. That’s how I learn if you use your patience on will to be able to do some safe.

Patience @CAPS3 a sense of tolerance. Having ‘’the patience’’ means that you can wait, it will come to you if you just wait. like when you gobble your food down thinking its going to he stolen, when really, you could have left it there and yet it would still there. Patience @CAPS3 knowing that everything @CAPS3 going to be ok and you have time. Having patience to do somthing, @CAPS3 to take your time, or go at your own pace believing you will finish. Patience @CAPS3 qenrally how long you can wait to do somthing, or even put up with something. Patience could also mean now long you can put up with somthing, like a bully for instance. He or she makes fun you again and again. But how long, how much patience do you have before your just pushed off the edge and you cant take it any more! THAT’@CAPS1 @CAPS2 PATIENCE @CAPS3.

The time when I showed patient is when I was having to go down a waterslide. It all started when I was in @LOCATION1. I want to go swimming at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. The place was so big, you could fit @NUM1 people in it. The time I was patient is when I was going up the stairs to the slide when every body rush in front of me just to go down @NUM2 slide’s. So I waited about @NUM3 minutes just to go on fun slide. The blason it took me so long is because you have to walk up @NUM2 flight or stair’s with in ??? So the second time  I went up I ran up the stair’s so I could be the first one, so I did and  I still had to wait because it still people there from last time. So I waited my turn. That is the time I showed patient.

A Time I was patient was the time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I whent to the @CAPS3 @NUM1 hours early. @CAPS7 we walk up to the front desk panting from ruming because we thought we were late and the @ORGANIZATION2 said "Are you ok!" I said "@CAPS4, am I late for the appointment for foyce"! Wo your @NUM1 hours early " she said" @CAPS2 you pulled me. Out @CAPS1 two favorite hours in school to be @NUM1 hours early"! I said "sorry would you like me to take you back to school" "@CAPS6 I'm good ".I said @CAPS7 we waited in the loby and I was fine with it because I had the???west as game @ORGANIZATION1 ball @CAPS8 than chichi @NUM4 for @CAPS9.S! I just played that until I got bored of it then I read some wired adult magazine. By the easy I was only @NUM5 when this happened and now I'm almost @NUM6. Then the @CAPS3 walked out and I got @CAPS1 shots. That was the time I was patient the most ant longest

@DATE1 one, day I was at the store with my sister and my mom thair were people coting, runing in each other and yelling “get out of my way”. That made me mad and every one else but like every one else I was not yelling at the overwellmed people. It was almost christmas I seen why every one was geting so mad. We were all trying to just mind are own bussnie. But for some reson people dust made everyone else mad so that’s when patience came in. After all we got out and when home. That’s why you should have patience.

One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didn’t see anything but we weren’t going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn’t hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie.

Patience can really help you in life some times it’s the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important. Just like how my dog ran away and I’m waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you'll get in a sitchation were your waiting for someone but there is always only one choice, to wait or be patient.

My dad is a very patient person. He’s known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited a whole @NUM1 years just to get one lense for it. Because he was patient. My mom is very patient. My mom is patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers, because she was patient. I’m proud to have such patient parent. Which means that I know they are very responsible and that is what I think patient is.

When my brother, my dad and my two cousins got out of the car from the @NUM1 hour drive from @LOCATION1, we knew would have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller @CAPS1 galore. I saw at cedar point, the amusement park. In the car we talked about the @CAPS1.  The maverick, milleniur force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the mentis. When I walked in, I knew this way going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go a back later. As the day goes on we go almost of the @CAPS1. As we approach the @CAPS4 we see at least @NUM3 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrive at the @CAPS2 the line was bigger then the start of the day. We discussed and decide it's not getting any smaller and go on the ride. About a later a @NUM4 years guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and deserved the wait. This is how I was patient and leard waiting leads up to good things.

One time I was pacient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS1 + cousin. I had to baby sit my cousin @CAPS2 while his room pack up cause they were making back to @LOCATION2. My cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets his way. But I was pacient  and waited til the trip was away. I didn’t complain til  I got home til  my mom. Me and my cousin got in lots of fights on that vacation. But I still love him . I had to be very pacient with my cousin and even maybe do what he wanted but I knew his mom was very proud of me. I remember when we went for a walk to a pond to find alligators. But then @CAPS2 wanted to go to the pack.I knew I had to give in ( considering that hes @NUM1 and immature). But I just went with the flow and we went to the pack. That was a time that I had to be pacient.

Patients is something not everybody has. In order for someone to be patient, you have to understand and tolerate things that might be very hard. I m one of those people. Patients is a sort of a gift. It takes time to have patients and you can not always be in a hurry. For example, one time I heard someone talking in my basement. So I went down there to see who was in my house, @CAPS1 I was walking I heard giggling and excitement I kept on walking until I heard the voices coming from behind a door. I went to open it and I saw all kinds of gifts and I saw two people, my mom and my dad. They hurried up and closed the door and told me to go up stairs. So I ran up stairs to tell my brothers what I saw. They were all excited and everything. The next day went by and I could not wait until @CAPS2 the next day. So I waited

@PERSON1 wanted a dog. She really did. She had been asking her @CAPS1 for a while now. Every time she would ask her @CAPS1, would reply “You can’t get a dog until you earn it.” @PERSON1 didn’t know how @CAPS7 earn it, she thought about it for a while she didn’t really know what her @CAPS1 meant, she figured that her @CAPS1 meant that she needed @CAPS7 @CAPS8 her some responsibility. She looked at the clock it said @NUM1, almost time for dinner, she thought her @CAPS1 was probably, working on it, so she walked out @CAPS7 the kitchen & there was her @CAPS1 making dinner. @PERSON1 asked a little more than loud “what’s for dinner?”  steak & mashed potatoes. That was @PERSON1’s favorite. She nodded & said “can’t help!” “why not?” her @CAPS1 questioned. @PERSON1 asked her what could she could do & her @CAPS1 said @CAPS7 get the salt & pepper @CAPS7 put on the cooking steak. Her @CAPS1 felt pretty happy that @PERSON1 was willing @CAPS7 help out. @PERSON1 did what she could then went upstairs @CAPS7 her room, she was hoping her @CAPS1 would get the message. She ate dinner with her @CAPS1 then she went @CAPS7 bed. The next day she ran down the stairs @CAPS7 find her @CAPS1 sitting on the coach. She said quickly “what are we doing today?” her @CAPS1 answered “I was thinking we could just hang around the house.” @PERSON1 was getting impatient she wanted a dog & she was trying her @CAPS6 @CAPS7 be good, then finally she last it and shouted “are we ever gonna get a dog???” her @CAPS1 surprised of @PERSON1 said “well……” @PERSON1 interrupted “@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ONE AND I @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 YOU! “her @CAPS1 answered well if you were more patiet I was gonna say maybe we could go look at anne” @PERSON1 felt bad for veiling & realised things will turn out better if she wailse later that day her & her @CAPS1 went and out a day.

The time I was patient was when my sister droped my phone in kool-aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Everyday for the rest of that week I was good. I still didn’t get a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her faught, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to become impatient, but I didn’t. The next day my sister took me into the metro pcs store to pick out a new phone. See by being patient I finally got a new phone, and that’s the time I was patient.
<START>

A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient excepcially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patient because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and their were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines where long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn’@CAPS1 mine. I went back drank my pop and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient.

A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didn’t get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldn’t get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but don’t give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them.

One time I went to the doctors. The docter said to wait in this room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said a nother docter will come in. we waited three hours in that room. My mom was mad, they forgot about us. The docter that was spose to come in went in the wrong room. The worst part was I had to get three shots and I hate shots. In conclusion. I learned my mom is not that patient and I got ice cream after the docters so patience always has a reward.

There goes another @NUM1 minutes wasted! I knew I should of got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @CAPS1 for food? Three days ago, l though that l should stop at my locker before going to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty, "what's the hold up?" I thought. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, @CAPS6 the food was at! I reached out and - wait @CAPS6's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza enticed my sense and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, "@CAPS6 is the food?" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. I bailed to the other line. I gripped tongs with disappointment and put chips and cheese on my plate. At least l had some food! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience ." l got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometime you @MONTH1 get rewarded!

A time were I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I got my broken foot. I was waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be hard sometimes but everybody can have patients.

One day not @CAPS1 very long ago, my brother @PERSON1, had homework troubles. And yes @CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I had said “on what.” @CAPS1 he said “@CAPS2 math homework its just too long and I can’t do it.” @CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. @CAPS1 I helped him. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper.

Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life.

Patience is a very important value. To sacced you need patience. I have used patience in my life when I got my first horse. I needed patience with her because she was stubborn, self- centered ,and poorly trained. I had to teach her moves at a slow pace so she could remember how she was supposed to do it. I also needed patience for her because she had just moved to the present home and didn’t recognize the surroundings. These though, are only some of the ways patience has appeared in my life

Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn’t panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners.

Then he would ask my brother be like you know I got this money for my baby. So he would keep asking people and it was getting on my nerves because when somebody say they dont have it they dont have it. I didnt say nothing I was quiet because it was his birthday but I know how to be patience when it’s something important or special. So I just was watching him and watching him and then I said here you can have my money it is your birthday so here you go.

What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient.

Two years ago my dad had surgery on his because he broke it at work .I had to sit in a waiting  room  for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do .Every two hours my mom ,grandma ,grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch .After about four hours I got really  tired ,but didn’t fall asleep .That was the longest I’ve sat in one place my entire life .At first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half it only seemed like two .

I am patient in a lot of stof, when I play I am patient. When I take a test I am patient. I am almost patient in everything. Lots of people are patient too. Some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer there not patient. They just want to take the ball and score. One time I was playing at the park with my friends I was playing soccer my friend told me to pass the ball. He was not patient at all that day.

Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you’re quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you’re waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren’t doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that you’ve lost, and you’ve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened I’ve experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what I’m trying to say is that when you’re patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn’t a “bundle of roses” all the time, so soon or later, you’re going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isn’t human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, I’m certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently.

One day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told and security took us back to the end of the line. We where mad and my dad was losing his patients too. We wait for hours till it was finally our turn. We wait that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time l lost my patients.

The time I was patients with my little brothers! I was baby sitting and they wouldn’t lison to me or my other sister and I just relaxed and got on the floor and played with them after that all went well.

Do you ever fell like your @CAPS1 is going to expload? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how l felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that l want to expload. The story starts at @TIME1pm my brother @LOCATION2 just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so I looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister @PERSON2, and my friend @LOCATION1 came up from behind me and stopped @PERSON2 said "I didnt want you to walk to get @LOCATION2 by urself" so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called @LOCATION2 and said we didnt see him and it was already @NUM1 he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door @PERSON2, and savanah were already at the party store @LOCATION1 questioned me and asked "@CAPS2 did it take you so long" I told her what happened as @PERSON2 pushed the @PERSON1 and savanah rode on the handle bars. In my @CAPS1 l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. The lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again.

I have to be very patient for a while because my sister is going to have her sweet @NUM1 in @DATE1.

It gets hard for me to relax while they go out and get stuffs for party and on top of that we are taking a trip to @LOCATION1 before her birthday. So we have a lot of planning to do in a month in a half.It’s very hard, she has to be patient. Watch my mom?? ?? plan a party and still be able to ?? on the trip to @LOCATION1 with my family. All my life, I have lived ?? being patient but it  ?? ?? ?? ?? try to be patient ?? ?? ?/ ?? ?? ?? ?????????

My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors. It was a long day. At first we went in and it it took a hour just for her to get in. and she finally did get in and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I would see people come in and then go out. I see about @NUM1 people do that. I sat and read magazines why I was waiting she finally came out. When she was the day was pretty much over with then. And that was a very patient day.
<START>

One day when the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 came out I wanted it so bad so I asked my mom and she said maby for @CAPS2 and guess what @CAPS2 was coming up. It was @DATE1 and I couldn’t wait so I went to school and I got it over with every day and I kept coming there and saying” I’m for sure that I will get a @ORGANIZATION1 just like mom” and that’s about the handreth time I said that to her and she said “ you have to be patient or I will probley never even get it for you because you have a little brother around and if he hears you say saying I want this and that he’s going to think @LOCATION1 is not real so be patient. Well for the past few days I started being patient and I had to be patient for a while because it was only @DATE2 to and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time but I didn’t care because I was about to get a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing I am lucky for not asking for a @CAPS3 for the past few days I’m being patient I really can’t believe it I really never been patient anytime except for now when I’m getting something awesome. So now I have only @NUM1 more days antil @CAPS5 so I’m really exited. So I was on a @CAPS5 break on the last @NUM1 days antil @CAPS5 so I played video games to save up my time of being patient then the last @NUM3 days I’ve been  playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there whose only @NUM3 more days antil @CAPS5 and I just played outside intel the day was over on those last two days I even played outside with my friends on @CAPS5 eve. Then the day came @CAPS5 finaly I saw  my presents and my mom said ya open them sort starred to seen them and once I opened all my present I did not see the @CAPS3, antil my mom gave me one present that she was holding and it was the @CAPS3 and finally I got it so now I don’t have to be patient no more, the end

@NUM1 @CAPS1 ago a kid named @CAPS2 was having a problem. This problem is something he would like to keep to himself. He felt like this problem was going to end him. His problem was that he had to go to the dentist!!!@CAPS2 hated the fact that they drill into your teeth. He also hates the smell of dentist office. @CAPS2 had to go in three days and he was even more scared because he's going by himself this time. He then realized that he can't be such a baby so he desited to be patient. He easily waited throw the whole two day and then the day came. He woke up and he road his bike down to the dentists and then he wait a short period of time before he had to go back to the room wear the dentist give you your check up. He desited to close his eyes and be patient. After it was over he went home and was relieft  patients was there.

Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life.

Patientce is hard for example when you walk in to a @CAPS1’s office you must patiently wait your turn to see the @CAPS1. Patience is just another word for “wait” you have to be wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you patiently wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you “@CAPS2 wait to see the @CAPS1. Patience is hard for some people. Many people cannot patiently wait to see a @CAPS1. another example is “@CAPS3” when familys go on a road trip you here @CAPS3 say mom when are we gonna get there, and that is my weakness we, well that is a sign of no patience. Whats so ever so what I would say if someone came up to me and said what is patience”? I would say “wait” wait your turn, ??? for the dos, wait for the @CAPS1, and wait for us to get there.

A  time   when   I  was  patient  was when  I  went  to  the  doctors. When  I  went  to  the  doctors  for  a  checkup, my  appointment  was  at  @TIME1 and  we  didn’t  get  called  till @NUM1.  I had to wait a long time! Finally  when  we  got into the  doctors room  the  nurse  did my blood pressure and then  I  had  to  wait  another  @NUM2 mins  for  the  actuall  doctor. By the time the doctor   actually came it was about @NUM3.  I  got  my  flue  shot  and  the  swine  flue  shot.  When  I  was  all done  it  was  @NUM4  I was  ready  to  go  home.  That’s  a  time  when  I  was  patient.

Some people a completely patient. Some people aren’t patient at all. But me; I sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patientce, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If it’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When we’re going somewhere special, or I’m trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! It’s like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can’t always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when I’m cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I’m super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn’t come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you don’t have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don’t get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers aren’t always patient either. I think we should just try to be patient as we can, all the time!

Patience is not fun butt is sometimes necessary. Im going to tell you how patience is not fun.It was a calm day at school. I was waiting for the well to ring. My friend @CAPS1 was going to finally give me an answer to my question. The question was do you love me? I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Ring! Ring ! Ring ! Finally I could see @CAPS1 as excited as I was I rushed out the dorr. I went to his locker and he gave me a note so I read it. It said passibly maybee I like you. I was so happy. Patience is not fun, but I got an answer to my question. Next time you have to be patient just thing good thing come to those who wait.

In some point you have to be patient. If you are in a line need to be patient. you have to be patient to waiting for a share to part. You have to be patient if something is coming in the mid and you can as wait to what is or you no what it is and you just can’t ran to get it.

I love crismase because you got almose everything you want; When something you to do something you have been wanting forever you are going there for the first time.

This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I’m empty on the inside, i goess. There’s gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He’s always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He’s useless now, but I’m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it’s not just @CAPS2 who I’m waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he’d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn’t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. He’s gone hasn’t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. I’m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I’m still waiting for a hello.

Being patient means that your understanding and tolerant, I have been patient too. When I went fishing I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Not complaining , not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself when ever some one caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friend’s home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didn’t have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something big’s tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldn’t break. Finilly I held the fish high over my head in a triumghant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years.

The four sisters waited in line the second most exciting ride of their days at cedar point. Right behind @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The roar of the roller coaster and the screams of its riders zoomed by @CAPS14 it started to get quit again. “I am soon super, doper excited!”  @CAPS4 the youngest sister ???. “ I know me to.” The rest said at almost the same time. Eight hard eyes moved at the same time watching the same thing. The @CAPS5! There were twists, torirs, diues, and hills involved with  this serious packages deal. “@CAPS6”. @CAPS10 long has it been?!” ??? @PERSON3. “@CAPS7 hour.” @CAPS8 the oldest, ???, putting her long, dark, curiy hair into a pony tail. “@CAPS9 young grasshopper” said @PERSON4 has the petteel the side of??? face, “@CAPS10 this son has really got to me “@CAPS11!” agreed @PERSON1 with a look of displeasure on her face. “@CAPS12 my ??? guys look! Were almost to the front!” exclaimed the second oldest @PERSON2. “@CAPS13 me!” said a voice coming from??? abuse. “@CAPS14 you for being patient, but we are experiencing some difficulty with the ride and it will be fixed as soon as we ran. Thank you.”  “ I really hope @CAPS15 finish it soon!” said @PERSON3. ‘@CAPS15 all agreed. @CAPS15 waited for about a half @CAPS7 hour @CAPS14 another anouncement came on. “@CAPS16 again thank you for being so patient but this problem will not be fixed for another @NUM1 hours. Thank you for choosing cedar point.” And the voice shut off and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, go ride the grant swings.

It was the day of central @LOCATION1 and it was after school that I was in the paraid with my football team and the line was going really slow and eventally we have done and it was off the home with my best friend @PERSON1. Well his preparing me and I went to his house and played a little and then we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1’s there were about @NUM1 cars and they were all in the drive through and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game didn’t start until @NUM2 and it was @NUM3. So we sat there patiently and ordered are food and left to go to the football game. And that’s a time when I was patient.

Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 it now not later. You must stay calm and be pieceful in patience that they almost forgot what they are whating for but I always @CAPS1 it now too. I can't stand not having something. If theres a test on @DATE1 .I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't what that long and it gives my tension just knowing whats going to happen. If you have patience it's almost like a gift just like singing and dancing one a gift.

“it’s where?”  The woman asked for the third time. “@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,” I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didn’t say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often don’t meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  “@CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.”  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of young’s incorporated.  “@CAPS3, you’re with young’s?”  @CAPS4 asked. “  Do you know where the show room is?”  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  “@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.”  I said in a robotic voice.  “@CAPS6’t  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?”  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  “@CAPS8, sir.”  “@CAPS9 old are you?”  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  “@CAPS11, sir.” I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high –schooler,  so I knew @CAPS4’d  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. “Are you getting paid?”  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  “yes,  sir.  But it’s @CAPS12 a lot.  It’s more like volunteer work,  really.”  @CAPS13 don’t ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  “thanks son.” “You’re welcome.”  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think we’ll both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dad’s shop, because if @CAPS4 didn’t, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient.

Patience when a person is patient the can wait a thousand years   for an answer. Or he/she is understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time, and keep his cool. That is amazing. Patience is when the person is always their when you need help and he will give you patience by just around him. I think patience is calm, doesn’t lose his temper and helps you when you need a little boost of patience

I always have to be patient when I put way model airplanes together. Sometimes I have to ask my dad for help when putting together harder models. Like the @CAPS1- @DATE1 on the @NUM1 bombers. I also have to be patient when hunting for rabbits, squirrels, deer and turkey. If I’m not patient I could mist a good shot or a good animal. I sometimes have to patient at school with @CAPS2 and other students.

At time when I was patient when I really wanted to go to my favorite store. @CAPS1 I woke up and I told my dad that I wanted to go to my favorite store. @CAPS1 my dad said “lets go.” @CAPS1 we went to the store and it said that it was closed. @CAPS1 I check the hours and they were going to open in @NUM1 minutes. @CAPS1 my dad and me being patients. Well mostly my dad because he did not say “let’s go” or anything. @CAPS1 @NUM2 mntues past and we had @NUM3 more minutes to wait. Finally @NUM3 minutes past and it was time, but the people that worked there said to wait about @NUM3 minutes cause they had to set up things. @CAPS1 my dad like always nice. He waited @NUM3 more minutes, @CAPS1 we could go in. Now finally @NUM3 minutes past and we got to go inside and I was @CAPS1 happy. Being patient is the best thing ever. No complaining or nothing.

It was a nice sunny day outside, in the middle of the @DATE1. It was so hot outside, it was like the sahara desert. “honey get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,” my mom shouted out the window. “@CAPS1 mom,” I questioned.”it’s a suprice”she answered. So I did what she told me while wondering where @CAPS9 were going. When @CAPS9 got there, I knew exactly where @CAPS9 were. @STATE1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. “@CAPS3 going to go on @CAPS4 @CAPS5, want to come,” I asked my mom. “@CAPS6, sounds like fun she replied.” When @CAPS9 got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. “@CAPS7, I don’t want to wait mom, its too long of a line,” I complained. “@CAPS8 patient, sweety @CAPS9’ll @CAPS8 on the coaster in no time,” she replied. One hour later……… “mom its taking forever.” I whimpered. “@CAPS9 are the next ones in line,” she replied still smiling. So when the gates opend i was so excited and nervous, I couldn’t believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. “You were very patient,” my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. “@CAPS6 I was, and @CAPS3 proud of that,” I said to myself.

One of the most patient time I have ever had was in downtown @LOCATION1 at one of the greatest @CAPS1 places around @CAPS1 poupules!

Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream "stop talking". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them.

I am writing a story about a time that I was patient. One day on my birthday @DATE1 I was over my dads house. My dad asked me were do I want to go for my birthday. I didn’t know at first but it came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paint hall shooting. And he said ok. But before we go he said can you cut the grass for me. I said ok. So I cut the grass which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes so I told him I’m done and he said ok, so I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. And when I got done takns my shower I called my friends and cousins to see if they would to come and they said sure. So I asked my dad when are we going to leave to go pointball shooting. He told me it is going to be at a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasn’t going to be today. They were ok with it. And my dad said we were going to go before @DATE2 stars and we have went. And now until this day I am still being patient.

There are many time @CAPS1 a persons life when someone was being patient. Patient @CAPS1 a very important trait that could lead to it own rewards. I am a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of dance. There @CAPS1 a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pieroette. Everyone who @CAPS1 in the class @CAPS1 so patient when these events happen. It @MONTH1 take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @CAPS1 a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respectful. Like I said, being patient @CAPS1 a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it.

@PERSON1 is waiting patient when the class is talking. I the class closet at ping she will clap third time until they stop talking or quiet.

I remember a time when @CAPS3 sister used to go on and on about @CAPS4 cream sundaes and all that. @CAPS3 mom had to drive me around all day because @CAPS3 dad was sick so that meant the “@CAPS4 cream girl” had to come along too! @CAPS3 mom knew @CAPS6 was in for a long day. @CAPS5 were in the car and @CAPS5 drove past a @ORGANIZATION1 and that’s when @CAPS3 little sister decided out loud “I’m hungry I want @CAPS1!!!.” That is what @CAPS6 said yelling for five minutes straight. That’s when @CAPS3 mom yelled “you speak another about @CAPS4 cream you are @CAPS2 getting it!.” @CAPS3 sister then had this face that meant @CAPS6 was about to cry, which was even worse!!! @CAPS3 mom gave her a cookie so @CAPS6 would stay content for a while; @CAPS5 started driving home when @CAPS5 heard a song on the radio, @CAPS3 sister loves to put the word “@CAPS4 cream” in every song so @CAPS6 started squirming while holding her tounge. @CAPS6 stayed that way all afternoon. @CAPS6 didn’t speak a word that entire day! So @CAPS5 drove past @ORGANIZATION1 and then @CAPS6 started to cry. @CAPS6 had enough. “I want @CAPS4 cream!!.” @CAPS5 were messing with her, so @CAPS5 went back to @ORGANIZATION1 and got her the thing @CAPS6 wanted most her  “@CAPS4 cream.” @CAPS6 was patient the entire day, @CAPS6 knew it was hard work. @CAPS3 little sister learned an important lesson that day, that “Being patient means good things will come to you.

Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your ??? because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the “aliens”. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesn’t cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, “I tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself.

Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time but when your impatient, you want to overcome the problem now or soon. I remember when my brother was @CAPS1 impatient. My brother @PERSON1 and I were waiting for a new video game to come out but it comes out in @NUM1 days. So he waited a day, checked the date, @NUM2. Then waited another day @NUM3. He wasted @NUM4 days waiting while I focused on school. His grade drope to a @CAPS2+ and now he’s blaming @CAPS3! So I told him hard @NUM5sucsess. He tried harder @CAPS4- he was using his time on grades while his game he wants is @NUM6, he’s a lot happier now that hes patient using time wisely while keeping himself occupied.

Being Patient by: @PERSON1 A few years ago, I started to horse back ride. I love it so muc h.  About @NUM1 month ago I ordered new riding boots. This is a time when I defien tly had to be patient. Me and my mom went on stake line tack.corn and ordered  my new boots. When they arrived, they were too  small so, we sent them back. Days and days went by as I waited for my boots. They didn’t come. I had to be patient. Another day went by and my mom finally called them. They said when you re-ship something,  I goes through fourteen day processing. Both me and my mom had to be patient. Weeks went by and still no boots. My mom have gotten a new credit card that week.  Another week went by and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card, it said declined. But @CAPS1 the problem is fixed and I’m glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 riding comfortably in my new riding boots.

But that did not help much becaus I could not feel my face and I saw a clock inside the school and I found I had only been here @NUM3 minutes! The wind and snow was terrible I was counting the number of teachers and people who left the school I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry. So I started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and I was dreaming of all the hot things in the world. First it was hot choclate then @DATE1 then it was florida in @DATE1 on a hot day. But I was staying patient as I could but it was vary hard. I was cold as ice and I dug into my pack to find something warm and I found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so my fingers did not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my moms car and then it passed a wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more! But when I stood up a car pulled in and it was my mom I got my stuff in the car and put the heaters on high and my mom said thanks for being patient.

Havening a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know some one who does” well that’s exacually what I am going to be talking about in my own way. Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience. Everybody always woundered about her there was something special about her. One day her and her family was going out and she couldn’t wait but you know what she had patience. Also she wanted to go get something from the store, @LOCATION1. She wasn’t like other children, couldn’t wait and always bother her parents she just sat patiently. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2’s too. She couldn’t wait to leave but you know what got her, patience in the store and get that pacific thing she wanted. When they got in the store she finally got what she wanted it was just lips glass five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was nearly to go then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience when they got home she was so tired and she wen’t up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait, that’s how accedents and problems happen and this little girl got every thing she wanted one thing, she had patience.

Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact one time I had to be very patience because my little cousin who live in @LOCATION1 had a pisered   since birth. It takes her a little longer to ge things because she @MONTH1 where she her own little would but it not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with truninig wheels but she tryed and she still know how today shes gotten way better but still has brain problems. So I’m taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. She’s improved over the years it takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really don’t yell at her cause shes very emotional and sencitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience.  So she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patience and she will @CAPS1.

Yester day I went to the orthodontist and waited for my check-up. @CAPS1 took a little while but @CAPS1 was my turn next. When I got home I felt like I was starving. I waited for dinner to be ready, but even though @CAPS1 was only an hour until @CAPS1 would be ready @CAPS1 seemed like @CAPS1 was a life time. The delicoas aroma coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat pationtly and read my book until @CAPS1 was done. After words I was watching ghost hunters when my little brothers came in and started to clean up the mess they made with thier toys. So I had to pause the show because they cant do anything when the @CAPS2 is on. So patiently, I waited for a excruciaing @NUM1 minutes until they were done. So over all I think I was very patient yesterday.

We were going on vacation to @LOCATION3  and  to  @LOCATION2. But we had to wait one whole week. Every day my little brother would ask “when are we going on our trip?” and every day my mom would say the soar thing. “In one week, in four days, in three, days, in two days.” @CAPS4 it was  the day to go on our vacation and  my parents were proud of me for  being  very  patient for  a week  waiting  to go to  @LOCATION3.

A time when I was patient was actually a few days ago. I was standing in line at @ORGANIZATION1 store with my mother so we could return abox that didn’t work. This was the third time we have had to return these boxes. I had to stand in line for an half of an hour and watch nothing but angry coustumers. Still @CAPS1 wasn’t our turn in line. This one man who was up at the counter was not very patient at all in fact he when he left he slammed the door and mumbled stuff under his breath. Finally @CAPS1 was our turn and my mom was very patient the worker, (even though she didn’t want to be) the worker didn’t know what was wrong with box so she gave her a new one and we left. Being patient can bring good things just like this quote I have always like @CAPS1 says “good things come to those who wait” @CAPS1 is very true so remember! Be patient.

One important skill you need in the life is patience. With my new, hard cast on my arm, I couldn't do many things. I was a very active child doing soccer, basketball, cross country, and football. But, with my broken arm I had to be patient with my sports. Being patient payed off and my arm healed faster without becoming but even more. Then I played sports after a had my coat cut off. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough.

Patience is a hard but good thing to have because patience can help you progress in your life such as getting a job. One way you would have to be patient when trying to get a job is when the boss is ??? your ressence aterring his sweet time.

So in conclusion patience is a good like skill to have because it can help our progress in life.

There are @NUM1 different languages in the world and different??? of these languages, in all that is  more than @NUM2 different languages. But in each language patient means the same thing, understanding and tolerant. Everyone had to be patient at one point or another, let me tell you??? one time were I was patient. It was just about one week ago when I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day I realized that we were both. I sent her e-mails, text messages, and I called her cell phone and home phone at least @NUM3 times @CAPS1 didn’t answer or reply. I got even more frustraited the more @CAPS1 ignored me, then I talked to my cousin about it. “You have to be patient with her, this is your first fight.”@CAPS1 told me in a calm voice. so, I waited by the phone to see if @CAPS1 meassaged me back without using  swear words, and I left her alone at school. Finally, one day @CAPS1 talked to me. @CAPS1 said “I’m sorry too, thanks for being patient with me. I’ve missed hanging out with you, how about we sit together at band?” “I’d life that.” replayed and finally made up after five days of fighting. After experience I learned that being patient   pay off. So wait your turn @NUM3 speak, and understand why people say what they say and mean what they mean. Patience is always the hey.

Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn’t care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn’t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I’m still alive, right? My friends don’t know me to have patience and I don’t either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again. Ever.

A time when I had to be patient was my @NUM1 birthday. Why because I was wait for my phone and mom cep telling that I was going to get it on the frist of @DATE1. But I still didn’t belive her and guess what my last present was my brand new cell phone& a case now that is wat I call pacent.

“Are the here yet?” I said as I pased back and forth. “Patience, it takes a while to get from the locker from all the way down here,” said @CAPS1 “@CAPS2! @CAPS6 on the camera!” “@CAPS3 got him!” said @PERSON1 “@CAPS4’s right behind us.” “@CAPS5 funny guys! You guys better give me back my clothes or I swearI ll @CAPS6 off the camera!” yelled @CAPS7 as @CAPS4 atempted to grab his clothes… and missed. “@CAPS8! My patience has run out @CAPS7!” I said taking another picture “@CAPS10 I think @CAPS3 should put this up on the internet.” I continued “@CAPS11! You can @CAPS5 put this on the internet!” “so your going to stop picking on us?” I asked “@CAPS8!” @CAPS4 said , “@CAPS13, then I’ll just zoom in right here.” “@CAPS13!” @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off. So to show the little respect @CAPS3 had for him, @CAPS3 gave hime his clothes, turned around, and walked away.

Crack I twisted through the air and anded face up with my arm-rapped around me. I felt a throbbing pain @CAPS1 I wobbled to my feat, “what just happened?” I thought to my self I once again began to feel the nurendous pain shooting through my fore arm. I bit my lip @CAPS1 hard @CAPS1 I could to choke back all of the tears from just pouning out like a water fall. My friends launched toward asking me. if I was ok @CAPS1 soon @CAPS1 I started holding my arm. “I think I might have broken it” I replied in between jobs they rushed to get an aid @CAPS1 quickly a possible. I soon found myself in the sick room after making a call to my parents to alert them of what had just happened. I sat there for hours waiting for my parents to come pick me up to go get an ex ray at childrens hospital. There were both at work and were not able to come and get me @CAPS1 the day groaned on I became more and more anxious. Finally the bell rang it was @NUM1 at last.  “bang!” the door swung open it was my dad and not for behind him was my mom. @NUM1 is when they get out of work after my mom and dad told be how much there were glad it was nothing more than a broken arm , they immediately rushed me to @LOCATION1. That was my experience of a time I had to patient. And in the end it turned out I had a broken arm. In life there are going to be many situations where your going to have to be patient, lout all you can do is take life @CAPS1 it comes at you.

I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off.

A time that I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. It was after my birthday and I had wanted pink @ORGANIZATION1 shoes. My dad in @LOCATION1 said he would get them but he would have to buy them, send them to grandmas house and then have my grandma send them to me and that I would get them sometime after my birthday. So one day he called and told me he sent them and I should get them in one week. So I patiently waited for my shoes and in one week. They were not at my house. I ididnt want to buy my dad and call him every day about them so I just patiently waited. After @NUM2 more week I began to worry and get mad so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said that my grandma was bringing my shoes in an hour. So I was patient and waited one hour and my shoes still hadn’t come. At this point I just decided they would just come when they came and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes the next day and I was estatic. I thanked my dad and I wore my shoes the next day knowing my patience payed off.

@CAPS4 I'm patient, and sometime I'm impatient. But no matter how impatient l am, my @CAPS5's even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs at the long delay, sighs, and gets very impatient. He says things like, @CAPS1 on, @CAPS2" "@CAPS1 on!"  @CAPS4 it's scary to be with @CAPS5 in traffic jams, or long lines. But after the long line. @CAPS5's himself again which is a great relief on my past!"

One day my mom, my sister, and I was going to the hair salon to get our hair done. It was so many people there talking. It was kind of noisy too. The tv was on, the radio was on, and a bunch of people talking. When we got there my mother signed all three of us in on the sign in sheet then we had to sit and wait. We waited for a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day but my mom said we had to wait. I got hungry and I was sleepy. We waited for an hour. I didn’t let it bother me, so I turned on my @NUM1 player and listened to it until it was time for us to come next. Then we had to wait another hour, and I got even more hungry but I didn’t say anything. So we waited and waited and finally we were up next. And we all got our hair done. Then when we left we went to get some food because we were all hungry. And that was a time I was patient at hair salon.

So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didn’t take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait.

So on @DATE1 I got up really early but my mom was running really late getting home from work, and she was the one driving me there. So my @CAPS1 was being really understanding and patient. So my mom got home drove me and we ended up a hour and a half late but my @CAPS1 was still very patient. So we started to help me and I was completely lost I didn't understand anything she was talking about but she still tried and was very understanding. I got almost every question wrong that she asked me and she still try to her best ability to help me understand it. She had to helping me for about @NUM1 hours but she followed through and really helped me and I actually got a A on that quiz all because of her help and patience with me.

My mum is someone who is patient. One time when I was little, I got gum stuck in my hair. I was crying a lot and moving around as my mom patiently tried to get the gum out of my hair. She kept on telling me to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself. When she couldn’t get it out and said that she would have to at in out, I had screamed. Tet, with patience, she was some how able to cut the gum out and still keep my hair looking nice even though I wouldn’t sit still. I think my mom is the most patient person that I know, because whenever something happen, she is patient about it.

There was a kid named @PERSON2 who was always very patient. He always waited for every else and he never complained. That morning @PERSON2 just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bath rooms were taken up but @PERSON2 didn't complain he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. @PERSON2 was a little bit late to school. The @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 said come here and the class said ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! @PERSON2 is in trouble. @PERSON1 said come here and @PERSON2 put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch @PERSON2 was at the end of the line. Once @PERSON2 had gotten up there, there was no more food it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch. Once @PERSON2 got home his family threw a patient party. @PERSON2 was honered and also happy. That night was the best for @PERSON2

As my dad allways tells me, patient is one of the vary begs to being successful in life. As I mature I find out more and more that patients is important. I remember a time when I had to display patients for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to ceadar point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. “@CAPS1 ride gave me the most fan, heartstopping, andrenalin pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, I began to get tired. After @NUM1 hours of walking we reached the mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. I was disapointed to find out it’s a @NUM1:30 hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figure the best way to do @CAPS1 was to keep quiet and relax. It seems that the more you complain the longer it takes. And before we knew it we were about to get to get on the ride!

“@CAPS1 hour and thirty minutes, are you kidding!” I said as my dad and I got into the line for the ride the “maverick” at @CAPS2 point. “That’s what the sign say’s, but it could take longer,” my dad replied. I said in a disappointed tone “I gusse we can wait,” but in my head I reminded myself you have zero, zipo, none no patience! Why did I say yeah. Right when my thoughts were done the line moved up a little. That was quick I thought. During that time to the time the line moved again I had occupied myself by watching people on the @CAPS3 and other rides go by. The line moved up again. Watching people didn’t work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half way in the line. My patience was running out. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didn’t want to go back, what I would miss, and was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every seconde. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and move up. We were finally at the front, and I didn’t complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end I was really worth it I thought. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain. That was a time I was patient

One time I was patient when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a @NUM1 hour drive threw @LOCATION2 and that is the way we went, I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ake so my ear was hearting and I had to wait @NUM1 hours. Another reason is my little brother @PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not so eventully I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would. The last reason is we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. Then when we were at the front of the line a guy asked my mom question and he asked my two brothers and I who the two people were in the front seat and we said “are mom and dad”. He asked that to make sure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all reason’s why I had to be patient on are @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town.

A lot of people are patient and they wait because they don’t want to make someone mad or mess-up something that they are doing. People always be careful of what they are doing. I ever be patient sometimes and its not that hard to be patient it is pretty easy. Everyone absouletly knows that, those people are out their, they know, trust me. Theirs many different things that’ve been patient for, but I don’t know which one I choose to write, cause there is alot of them. “@CAPS1 someone is in the bathroom, wait patiently but @CAPS1 you can’t or can’t hold it, keep knocking on the door or just use other one, or @CAPS1 someone on the computer then wait for your turn, but @CAPS1 its been pass in an hour then tell that person to get off not to be mean, but you either need on and have your turn. There is no way you can’t be patient for at leat @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes. Not too hard. It’s pretty easy and everyone knows that too you know.

I am going to write about a time I was patient. The time I was patient was when I went to fuzzys and it took a long time. It took @NUM1 minutes. It seemed like took forever. It was a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason why it seemed forever was probably because I did’t eat nothing. There was me my mom and dad. You can also buy ice cream. My stomach was hurting and I was hungry. I had tries to. Some people have patient and other don’t. I kind of have patients. But this time I had no patients. Now when I get a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it seems not that long. That is a time I needed patients.

A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the year of the seventh grade. It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and sayed there was a delay. So as the rest of the class complained I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though so I just kept my cool. Then eventually our grade was called downs to have lunch. That the time when I was patient over something.

And another time my mom waited in line under the rum it was burning the only thing she did to cool down was drink for about two hours under eithy one degrees an she was still patient.

Soo know were here and @CAPS1 just soo happy to sit and waite because my mom did tell me thousands of times “you need to stop being so unpatient,” well I cainte help it. Any way my mom just signed in for me so I guess I’ll just look at magizeens boring boring boring.

Once upon a time there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 was abnovius and always had to time it his way. @PERSON1 always waited his turn with something and shared.

Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 was early @DATE1, the leaves just beginning to change colors and flutter down above your head. My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned.

One time I was patient was when I was in science class taking a test. I was patient because I went up to the teacher because I needed help and so did the kid in front of me.

I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework. Some of them take awhile to explain to and I must use patience in order to help them. And I'll be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and get frustrated easily, like me sometimes. And at times I have been on the phone for a hour trying to explain homework to one of my friends. Soon I will once again have patience when I tutor for @CAPS1. To me patience is one of the most important characteristics someone can have.

I am not a very patient person. But when I have to be I am. For example at my house we only have one bathroom. I hate waiting to go. But I have to wait because I don’t want to jungle pee so I will wait. I also have to wait for my bust. I hate waiting its so boring. But patience is a good thing to have.  If we didn’t there would be a lot of deaths by car accidents, murders, nervous breakdowns. My sister is very patient she can wait in one spot for hours one time it was @CAPS1 I was all figtxy from waiting until the bell rang so we can go trick or treating. She waited well she did her hair I complained that is a reason why patience is important.

Patience is one of the most important things in life. Patience is being understanding and tolerant. For example a kids mom left for work she takes @NUM1 hours and she come home. The kid said “that was quick.” That is what patience.
<START>

For me im not that patient canse if some one close something to me or any of my friends I will go off on them can see I don’t tolerat my frinds bing picked on by some one they don’t even know or I don’t know. Thers this one time me and my frinds were walking down the hall way at school.

One time when I was patient was when my mom’s car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend that lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited an hour and a half waiting on her. My mom called called her back and she said she can’t make it because she needed an oil change. After that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, it picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked the rest of the way to @NUM1 mile and @PERSON1 where the was another bus that took us to @NUM2 mile and @PERSON1 where my school is. That was time when I was patient.

Patience is about waiting for some thing. Like we can say your new shoes will becoming in two weeks instead of paceing around worrying all the time. you just walk around like honnel. For example hunting you sit and wait for a deer to come. If your inpatient you would go look for some. Sometimes a lot of people can got inpatient about something and become mean. Being patient is understanding why it is taking a long time for something. You have to to herdteif it dont come the come the @DATE1 it supposed to. This one tim I had a @CAPS1 appointment at @TIME1 and my mom and I had to wait until five o'clock. And we never got mad just a little board. This one time a friend of mine was waiting for his dad didnt  come home until the @DATE1
<START>

Paitience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone or for something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but momdid not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said wait a little while be paitient.” I went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker. I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles.

A beaker bubbled in @LOCATION1 lab. I could smell the sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. “@CAPS1 what’s going on!” I yelped across the room “@CAPS2 found the cure for the cancer!” @CAPS3 said as @CAPS3 had a little jublee dance that @CAPS3 showed off. I am a doctor and I wasn’t so sure but I told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. “@CAPS4’s go try it out!” @CAPS3 screamed. As I zoomed to the car and waited while @CAPS3 packed up his lab equiptment. After @NUM1 minutes I was pondering where @CAPS3 could be. @CAPS3’s just having a hard time packing up I said. So I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a couple hours I woke up in shock. I had been sleeping @NUM2 ½ hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. “I saved this kitten’s life with my cure for cancer.” @CAPS3 said out of breath. I was glad I was patient or the kitten would have not lived. Just as I was thinking about how nice it was that @CAPS3 saved the kitten, my pager dinged. @PERSON1, the lady with extreme brain cancer needed our help. @CAPS3 got one vial of his cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw @PERSON1 laying there as translucent as light hitting off paper. I quickly got her heart rate down. At this moment I wasn’t sure if she would live. “@CAPS6 give it to her?” the mad scientist asked. I made a risky choice. “@CAPS7, not yet.” I waited five minutes and then poured it in. @PERSON1 came back to life. Even though @PERSON1 couldn’t talk, I could tell by her smile that she was very thankful I was patient. Her daughter walked into the room and said, “@CAPS8 you”. I only smiled back.

I am patient wherever I go to the dentist’s office, orthodontist, or doctor’s office. The first time is at the dentist’s office when I have to wait to get my teeth cleaned. I usually sit there and end magazines .The next place I am patient is outhodontist,I sit and wait in the first room and crater to my I-pod after a few minutes the call me into the second room where I wait little longer to get my bracer frightened . Once I get in the office I have to wait for the guy to tighter them. Finally there is the doctor’s office where you sit in the big waiting foom for a long time and wait for the lady to call you in when you get there if you are getting shuts you have to wait patienty for the doctor to being them. As can see a lot of things take patience.

One day I had to go to the doctors office to get shots. When we got into the doctors office I had to wait in some uncomfortable chairs, with my dad. It was my first time getting shots, and I didn’t know how it felt. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience, I just wanted it over with. I kept on asking my dad is the doctor coming yet, and my dad would always say patience. It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; which I did not notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight I ran to them. But after a few minutes it got so boring, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring I couldn’t take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldn’t take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didn’t let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out, and said “@CAPS1,” and I was releved that the doctor finally came to give me shots. But what I didn’t know was that I was going getin horrible pain for a few days.

I play hockey. I am a goalle. A good goalle is always paitient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalle faced lots of @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots. Most of the @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots didn’t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on @NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it.
<START>

“@CAPS1 on hurry up,” my friend said. “I know, be patient,” I said. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed. Being patient is all ways a good thing have you ever heard something like “Patience is a virtue? Well if you don’t get used to it.
<START>

One time when another person I know was patient was when my stood in line for over an hour to get the tickets for the show were going to see. This shows patintence because my did not complain while standing in line.
<START>

One time was the often best friend I had went to a ride it was so hot outside but the first ride we on was called the @CAPS1. The line was super long, it was like going  through a maze because how the rope were tied up we stood in the line for about forty five minutes but it felt like two hours . But I didn’t really complain about except for my friend she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large  feet were tired, but when we finally got there we stared rolling to know how . When we sat down in the rollar coaster it was so much fun. I think it was worth waiting for.
<START>

A time when I was patient was when I wanted a Do I. for my birthday. But I couldn’t get it because my moma had to pay the rent. So I waited and then finally it was my birthday. I didn’t have it but then @NUM1 months went by and it was @CAPS1 and I got it and I was so happy. @CAPS2 time when I was patient was when I had to babysit my cousin for @NUM2. And I waited a few weeks for my uncle to give me my money but he did not. So I waited and ?? to gave me my money. But not only did he give me @NUM2 he gave me a late fee @NUM4 and I was hapy. And that added up to my money, that my mama gave me and it was @NUM5 and I went skating and to the store with my friends. And I spent some of it at @DATE1 ??? and on @DATE1 added held ???. they were then @CAPS2 time when I was patient was when it was @NUM6 days before my birthday and I was leaving a sleepover I ??? went to go buy everything and it was like the next day was my @NUM7 birthday. I did everything I had so much fun it was like heaven at my house.

Patience. Patience is something I have absolutly nothing of! I take after my mom in this area. My mom is probably a little bit worse than me but we are both pretty bad. Sometimes we record t.v. shows and watch them later just because we don’t want to have to wait through the @CAPS1. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes any  longer than that puts me over the edge. On by the way another thing is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a @NUM1 hour drive turn into a @NUM1 minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish icould have more patience but I don’t know how to get it. I really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story.
<START>

One time I had to be really patience. It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs.
<START>

The time I was patient was when I went @CAPS1 fishin with my step dad. I could not wait for long so I decided to talk to myself or sing songs. My step dad said you set ur pole down on a sling shot holder and do whatever. So I went walk around explore the world and I was think about how I can do patience. I was to go check on my pole and I got nothing so I feel in the coast out for way so I sat wait and wait but until that moment my pole start to jak around so I reel in caught a large @CAPS1 I was so happy. My step dad said see you do got patience.
<START>

The time I needed patience. We were on the groccery store, @CAPS1 man to be exact.m When we first got there I was exited because we were going to get lots of junk bad, but ther. We started to get lots of food and it looked really good. I started to just eat it all. The cart was half way. ??? @CAPS7 we got more stuff and it was @CAPS3 full that we had to get another cart and it started to get hungry. But the time we were in the meat section, I was starving. My mom said “@CAPS2 me just get a couple one things.” @CAPS3 I waited, and waited @CAPS7 she told me to go to checkout. All of them were @CAPS3 long and I felt like I was ???(@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6) @CAPS7 this little girl walked up to me getting smart I couldn’t take it, I was about to talk that little girl down. But I had to calm myself @CAPS3, @CAPS7 I realized it was our turn and I was @CAPS3 happy. @CAPS7 when I got home mom cooked bacos and I was just ready to go to bed.
<START>

As I waited at the airport, I gazed at all walking by I pondered these thoughts in my head: “when will @CAPS2 be here?” @CAPS1 long have I been waiting and what time is it, wasn’t his flight supposed to be here @NUM1 minutes ago? Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice ‘@CAPS2 will be here soon, honey dont worry.’ I dont understand @CAPS1 my mother told a @NUM2 year old not to worry it was in our nature. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself ‘what good does complaining do? It only makes you upset.’ @CAPS3 these things ran through my mind, I gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me, I ran to him and gave him a hug. ‘I almost lost my patient’ @CAPS4 glad I stayed patient because if I wasn’t it would’ve ruined my fathers trip. Patience is a good thing to have, you can gain or lose things from it. In this case I think I gained something.
<START>

A time I was patience was one time we were @CAPS4 the store and I was @CAPS2 excited to go to the toys section. “@CAPS1 we were goin to have go to the grocerys first,” said mom. I was really mad and mom said “be patice the quicker we do this the faster well get to the toys.”  @CAPS2 we are @CAPS3 done with the grocery and then we have to go to the clothes section. I was really really mad. Mom said “the quicker we do this the fast we get to the toys.” @CAPS3, I had to try on clothes. I hate try I on clothes,” I said. Then I was @CAPS2 excited because we go to go to the toys selection I was @CAPS2 happy. I looked, an look an then mom said “I could pick out a toy.” @CAPS4 was @CAPS2 hard to choose I didn’t what to pick till I saw a cool truck. @CAPS4 had big tries @CAPS4 had flames and @CAPS4 was green. I asked and please please? An mom siad “@CAPS5 u can get I was @CAPS2 happy. And that was a time I was paticene.

I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctors office with my mom because I wasn’t feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said “@CAPS1 it’s already been ten minutes” “I wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor.” I said. “I don’.t know but lets wait a bit longer. Mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I signed. What is taking so long? I wandered. Was my doctor even here today? I starred at the wall and looked at the color of it. Orange. Before I knew it half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. “@CAPS1 it’s almost @NUM1!” “@CAPS2!” I said flustered and annoyed. “Are we just gonna sit here all day?” I asked. Finally my question was answered as a nurse said I could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness. “@CAPS3 for being patient! the nurse said smilling. I smiled back. I @CAPS4 been patient.

One day my mom said I could get this new toy at the store but my mom had to do other things before we went to the store so I had to be patient.

Patience can come in different was in life. For one thing, it can reward you at the end. For example, it can come in a bigger way if you are patient because it would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example you could wait for something, you could do something else when its time you deserve it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if your calm. For example, people can’t wait so they just want to rush and get to be done with it. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second wouldn’t be so hard because you would be calm. That is patience in my own way.

When I'm being a patient and I @CAPS1 nicely and I do not complain and I like to be pation and I @CAPS1 good I do not fell and sometimes people don't be them to calm down and sometimes when something is is taking forever I sometimes sat come on and I always be patent at school at restaurants and I always be patent ever I where bat sometimes I can't not be patent and I don't want people thanking  I m weird of ating  some thing I just @CAPS1 a neit it and I be patent in lines at the fail and at the fair sometimes have long lines and that is my goal is being patent of everything but sometimes I'm not patent because sometimes  something take to long and I just like to be patent.

In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didn’t get to sleep in very much, I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasn’t going with us. We got in the car, and drove to my uncle @PERSON1’s house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1’s old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching  the boat. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. “@CAPS1” my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life!! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight.

One day I was at the store with my friends. I picked out my slurpee and inline to buy my slurpee. then an old lady got in line. So to be nice I let her in front of me. @CAPS1 a while she found out that she was a dollar short. So I gave her a dollar. She turned to me said thanks and gave me a mint @CAPS1 I bought my slurpee, me and my friends had to cross the road. We sat their for @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes but it seemed like an hour. We crossed the road and walked to my house. On the way to my house my friend hold to use the restroom. So we went to the market. We had to wait for a hour before he came back out of the market. he told us he got lost. We walked home and on that day, I learned that it’s tough to be patient.

Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very exited and roudy. They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldn’t sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was hard to stay calm. Dispite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided  I was all right and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway he sais, “hi!” very excitedly. Now am glad that I stayed patient.

One day I was at my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 house to celebrate my cousins @CAPS3. He was turning @NUM1 years old. So we played games played on the trampolenc.

We had to come inside and @CAPS4 up for dinner. We all ate turkey, baked potatoes, cheese potatoes, squeen, beans. That was pretty good. Then they wanted us ??? project. It was a jon with a candle in it. We had to cover it in tisue paper and it uses lots of glue. I had to wait patiently I was the last one to domine. So I walled waited ??? then finally I got to do my project but I was ?? Only one there sitting at the table doing my project. It actually turned out pretty good after all.

Being patien will guide you through your hole life.

I am going to write a story about a tim e that I was patient. When I was eleven, on @DATE1 my mother was due to have her baby. I couldn’t wait I was so excited. We went to the doctors officeand we shifted into her room. (me and  @CAPS1 my mom’s best friend) and @CAPS2 her. When we got into the room my mother was having contractions,she was yelling, screaming and squeezing my dads hand. I got scared while she was yelling and I didn’t want her to get hurt. I walked out of the room and me and @CAPS1 went and got the baby @PERSON1 her first dress. The baby came home she was always crying  thats when I learned to be patient holding babys .

Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentist’s office. This @DATE1, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was waiting to be called in, a boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older women came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girl’s tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth. I didn’t it was fair that I had to wait another @NUM1 minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didn’t mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be manditory.

Patients is about many things. First, there is diffrent ways to express patients. Second, people either have patients or they don’t. I admit I am one of those people that don’t have patients. My mom is always saying, “@CAPS1 your horses.” @CAPS2 I know. I don’t have patients so why does she have to tell me I don’t? I don’t have any patients in grocery shopping I can’t wait to get out but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines man do I hate them the take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just can’t help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you don’t complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especillaly, when you are in a difficult situation it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you. Well that talks about patients and how people deal, relate, and chill about it.

I remember the time I got my new puppy we had to be patient. We had to be patient because, he wasn’t fully paddy trained yet and he was crazy. My dog is @CAPS1 and they are known for herding cows .So whenever we used to go outside he would bite our shoes. I don’t know  why it would try to move us but it did .We had to be very patient when we trained him, it took until he was @NUM1 and a half years out to figure out that he wasn’t supposed to do that  but on (my dog) is still growing into new hobbies. We just have to stay calm and patient and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for @CAPS2 dop to brave his hobbies, so we must stay patient. This is the time when I was patient.

There was a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when my cousins @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 were playing the wii. And I said I play winner @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON2 won and @PERSON1 didn’t give me the controller and she wasn’t sharing. @CAPS1 then I said she could play one more time then its my turn, instead she played four more times @CAPS1 I said @PERSON1 its my turn you played and I didn’t, she said “it is not your turn.” @CAPS1 then her mom said “@PERSON1 you can play @NUM1 more minutes then its @CAPS2’s turn” one hour thirty minutes past and she still didn’t give it to me @CAPS1 then I said @PERSON1 its my turn, and I’ve been patient for a long time you either give it to me or I’m going to take it, she still didn’t it to me. I’ve been getting ready and you still didn’t share @CAPS1 then she said I’m tired of it anyways. And that’s the time I’ve been patient.

One time I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor to take my shot for six grade. I didnt want to go but I had to go I didnt have a choice so I get in the car and we drive to the doctors office. Finally we arrived. My mom had to sign in and we sat down. Even though I was waiting for three hours I didnt complain about it. The doctors comes out and I got scared but happy that finnaly its my turn. Then he called a different name so whe and my awesome mother kept on waiting in the waiting room, then my beloved mother tells @CAPS6 wow @CAPS1 your not complaining now. I know manages that’s because @CAPS2 becoming more mature and I have a lot of patience. Thank @CAPS3 the doctor calls my name “@CAPS1 @CAPS5.” @CAPS6 and my mom go in the room. The doctor says you grew she the last time seen you. Doctor is this going to hurt? No sweetie its not. Are you sure. Positive, ok , ready, ya. So I close my eyes and imagine something really nice.

Ahh! I screamed in my mind. Baby sitting my cousin took a lot more patience. ( more her than me) @CAPS1 all at started on a @DATE1 @TIME1 my family went to go do some drink (I stayed behind to work on my homework) A little after my mom left I heard a knock on the door.  My aunt come in and whispered "you most??? @CAPS1 was okay is if I left @CAPS2" @CAPS3 I replied  "okay" @CAPS4 was asleep for about half- an hour. When I woke up @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 started crying. First thing I did was pick her up and carry her around. Still @CAPS4 was crying! @CAPS3 I thought her cloth need changing. I changed her cloth and??? Keeps crying. Now I had to keep my patience though because who would yell at a baby. Then I thought @CAPS4 was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle though @CAPS3 I had to read??? (@CAPS4 had no patience all @CAPS4 want was  her bottle) @CAPS5 when I was about to lose my patience I made a bottle bat sure if @CAPS1 was good) but @CAPS4 drank @CAPS1. Finally I put her back to sleep (if @CAPS4 cried one more time. I would do finally lose my patience) @CAPS6 @CAPS4 was sleeping @CAPS4 looked in peaceful until @CAPS4 woke up. @CAPS4 started crying again (this time I knew why because @CAPS4 likes to be carried).By the time my aunt came back my hands hare sore. Although at the end of the day I figured out, that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby you need way more patience for a younger brother though trust me).

I am going @NUM1 write about a time when I was patient. My advocate @PERSON1 was soppese @NUM1 buy me some pens fo many of @DATE1 year as part of my @DATE1 money. I have been asking him everyday since then. “@PERSON2, @CAPS1 @MONEY1 do ur daily shopping yet”?  “no.” “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 said “because I want my pens @CAPS4 @DATE1 present remember the @NUM3 owe me”. “@CAPS5 I do but be patient” “@CAPS6 ok my patients is about @NUM1 fall apart.”  I have been waiting ever since.

Have you ever have to wait in line to get on the biggest roller coaster at a theain park? Have you ever wait until all your chores are done before you can play with your best friend? Have you ever had to wait for your little brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story I will tell you about one time that I had to be patient. During @DATE1 I had to go to the doctor to get shots @CAPS2 that I could be safe. When I got to the doctor I had to wait in a room for my name to be called. It was @CAPS2 boring! And I was thinking, “@CAPS1 long does it take for a few people to get shots @CAPS2 that I can leave?” @CAPS2 I had to just sit there for about half- an- hour until my name was called. Then once I got into a back room I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and what not, and also for the doctor to get the shots ready for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end I got to go home and play with my friend. This is once of many times that I had to be patient. And at least I still got to play with my friend. I hope you liked it.

I was patent when I was waiting for a chance to go to cicago. I really wanted to go see the windy city because my mom went to @LOCATION1. I tried to forget about it until I went. It kind of worked but once in awhile it came back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didn’t bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I keept my patience. Sometimes I even forgot I forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didn’t care about @LOCATION1. No mater how tempting it was seing @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 hawks game on I kept my cool. Then it happened @MONTH1 @DATE1, imagen that it was @NUM1 and I was still patient! So, to put it in a nut shell no mater how long it took, I would be patient.
<START>

I am going to tell a story in my own way. It was @DATE1. My sister was turning @NUM1 years old. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “You have wait”. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s @CAPS3 slow,” @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, “@CAPS4 up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. That’s my story I told in my own way.
<START>

A  time that i was patient was when i had to train my dog. “sit boy,” I command to my puppy. My dog instead of sitting runs at me jump and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While @CAPS1 walking  to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away. After chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me waiting  to run again. “@CAPS2 here I’m done chasing you lets just go for a walk, please,’’ I say as i slowly loose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. “@CAPS1 done !” I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning @CAPS4 up and go outside to try and train dog.  I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today @CAPS1 ready to work hard and keep my patience. “@CAPS6!” I yell waiting  for my dog to @CAPS2 running and he does.With my first command i tell the dog to sit and he does not so I dont give him the treat. I say it again and he sits! Finally some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts waging his tail. To see if he understood i say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that work with my dog I begin to  ask him to do more things,sometimes he doesn’t listen and some times he does. That was a  time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definently paid off.

One time when I was patient was when we flew in the @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the I asked school. We flew to @LOCATION4 well and the to @ORGANIZATION1 but after that it was down hill. When we got to @LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours! after an hour I got bored with my little brother with us didn’t help at all. Then over the intereem we hear that we have to go through security now and sit in a room with a gift shop ??? all for @NUM1 hurs. When there was an hour left there was another announcement and it was that we will be delayed three more hours, after that I was listening to my ipod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally get to leave we walk up to six seater phase for us to fly to a small island near by. When we got to @LOCATION1 we hurry to the island school to see my sister. That was one time when I felt patient waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours.

@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3” I can hear the clock ticking ,probly to annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small classroom building. Every body is on the edge of their chairs waiting, why does @CAPS4 seem so long? Its almost @NUM1 minute now.the aroma of peperoni  pizza is so strong that I can practicly taste @CAPS4. This is agony. My stomach rumbles, so hungry. @NUM2 seconds can I wait that long @NUM3 I’m not sure. The tension ogf the whole class is so great,I think my brain will erupt. I cant take this, @CAPS4’s way to much. My eyes flash nervously to the @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 seems to be an eternity, @CAPS4 couldn’t have been just a few seconds could @CAPS4? @CAPS4 must have been at least years. @NUM5 why is time so short? I’m not a very patient, not at all. But do I have any amount of patience? If I do I’m not seeing @CAPS4 got. I’m about to just jump out of my seat as if I’m ejected from a @DATE1. I’m trying to hold still, but anxiety is getting to me. If I knew that I’d be this anxious for lunch that I would have had breakfast. Were down to @NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. @CAPS4’s enough to crush me now. I think I might make @CAPS4 @NUM7. My stomach rumbles again,brouse this time, begging for food, @CAPS5, demanding is more like @CAPS4. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,”the clock nocking me, taunting me @NUM8 seconds I can’t bare this much longer. I think am about to snap. I don’t handle patience well. @CAPS4’s a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off @NUM9 seconds. @CAPS4 seems the bomb and clock are counting down together. Both anticipating my snap. I’ll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have @NUM10, “@CAPS10!” finaly, the bell goes of signaling lunch time . I zoomed out like a squirrel who just sat on a snow cone.

Some people have a lot of patience. I am one of those people. I have have had a lot of patience in my life. We were driving to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 and I was getting antsy. I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom so I decide to be patient and read. Before I knew it we were there. I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining I stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day. Because if I wouldn't have been the my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at end the day.

One time that l was patient was when we went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. We had to wait in line for an half an hour. We were supposed to get on the cork screw ride. I was very excited to go on that ride. So I decided to be patient. So for @NUM1 min once we got to the front of the line l couldn't wait. So I hurried up and got on then ride. I really didn't like that day when l had to stand up that long. But, that what patience means.

On @CAPS1 while I was fishing in little travers bay for salmon, there was a tromendus hep on the trolling line, I lanched from where I was sitting like a rocket I heaved on the line I waited. I thought it was a false alarm (snag) put trust me I thought wrong. the pull did a dance then bent realy fast again. ''@CAPS2 on," I yelled to my cosin, he ran back to my aid. We @CAPS4 stared at the water the poll still flexed didn't move, I was looking for the tumble weed because I felt like I was in an old western movie stand of. Finale I looked at my cousin & said, ''I have been patient, do you think I should real him up"? "@CAPS3 me get the net first'', he fumed and grabed it then stated "When you are ready" I slowly cranced the handle on the real tie, tie, as I slowly cranted him from l??freaky depths. Then out of no where the steel cable that was my line shot from the ball like a bullet, but the a cyrick jerk from him and then the line went slak. My cosin & I @CAPS4 knew what had happened. the @CAPS2 I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters to flustrat more fisher men with his patient ways.

Quite a few times my mom has been very patient with me. I tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school when I come home. Once when we were sitting there in the living room, I was telling my mom the story. As I go on and on my mom has the patience to listen to it. Though the story @MONTH1 have been boring for her, and extremely long, she listened, she made coments and never showed a sign of boredom. The expression on her face made me happy to know she was listening.

One time I was patient when I let a stranger cut infront of me to get some food. And when me and my brother both had to use the bath room I let him go first even though I was first in line.

Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it,  patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and @CAPS1 my patience was before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!”@CAPS1 your patience!”my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me.

I was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store. Trying to build the whole store and I had to go to the bathroom real bad. I started to get real; mad because I thought the store person that was ringing up the stuff tryed to go slow so I couldn’t use it. The only reason why I didn’t complain was because most of the stuff and the bascket was mine. That was a time I was very patient

Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of @PERSON1 right next to famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me I’m not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient.

One time I had to be very pationt. I had two wait five hours before my grandma to get to my house. Every hour I would go look outside to see if she was there. Eventually she did and I was very happy. Some examples too shels stay patient are… @NUM1. Focus on something else @NUM2. @NUM3 too someones house for a while. @NUM4. Or even tack a nap @CAPS1 are examples of staying patient.

My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to chang the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and I’m not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very invoked because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining and when I finally frosted on that didn’t break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, bat she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go to slow, instead of yealing at me to harry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must of taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a @CAPS1 amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, anything in the recipe that could be dropped I dropped it, I also never wanted to stay clean it up and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor. My grandma is always patient with me no matter what I do.

A time I was patient was when I was going on the raptor at cedar point. There was a two hour line and me and my friend were getting bored. There was some music but that didn’t really amuse us. But I had never been on the raptor before and I was really thrilled to go on it. One hour dragged by. Then finally ten more minutes wait till I got to go on the raptor it was the best ride ever.

When they had no idea when to get inside and how to protect their food. Our time is way easier than in the old days, they had to work hard at everything what everything is given to us. Our two time periods are a lot different. There aren’t to many days where I am patient but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny @DATE1 @TIME1. I was starting quarterback and I scored @NUM1 touchdowns and I passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point we were up @NUM2 and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game. This was very hard for me because I had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench. I’m not a very patient person so this was @CAPS1 hard for me. I hope I’ll never have to do that again.

I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad before, @DATE1. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and did not get one. Some other guys shot one they all run way. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in we were all there from @TIME1 until @NUM1. I was patient the whole time.

One day, me and my parents went fishing. Our fish under was going off like crazy but know fish were biling . @CAPS5 got the point (in a short time I might add) where our dog would back like crazy wherever we started to real in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We waited, and waited, and waited, but still nothing came. Every once in a while we’d have to move again because of the current .After we’d  been sitting there for house on end .I felt something  on my line. I thought  at first I was snagged on a rock, @CAPS1 I started to reel in, the line came a little, @CAPS1 I reeled some more, I thought @CAPS5 felt like a fish pulling on my line, @CAPS1 I called out , “@CAPS3 ,dad, I think t have a fish !”. @CAPS1 my dad told me @CAPS4 to do. Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off, but the fish came into view! While dad got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, “@CAPS4 kind is @CAPS5? He said, “@CAPS5’s a walleye.” I didn’t know @CAPS4 to say. My first walleye! And dad even said @CAPS5 was big enough to @CAPS6! @CAPS1, then we went home, filleted the fish, and had walleye for dinner.

It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at school so boring as usal and my @CAPS1 came in on cruches I freaked out and, ran over to her and she told me she broke her leg and that she wasn’t allowed to hang out for a whole month. It was hard waiting a whole month to hangout with her but, her safety was more important than my amusement. It was @NUM1 weeks after my friend breaking her leg out, I was doin well of not bothering he so I was proud of myself, but I got to help her around school. It was a few more weeks later she was almost better so I was excited and went and bought her a gift. The next @DATE1 @PERSON1 was out of the crauches and, cast and back on her foot that’s the story of the time I was patient.

@PERSON2, get down here I need you to open an evelope! My mom said. We spanted down stairs because an envelopes can only mean, a report card, letter, @CAPS1 card, or checking account balance.  We got downstairs and we saw they had a camera out, and the envelope had a starrer on the back that said @NUM1 radio. We open @CAPS6 and @CAPS6 says congroduclotions you won tickets to @NUM2 first @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with @PERSON1! I was just looking at them in awe, my sister was freaking out! Then, my mom told me that my aunt is going with us! Surprise just kept coming and coming. Another huge surprise was the lines about @NUM3 girls were lined up at the front doors of the @CAPS4 oak music @PERSON3. Then security started to move and spread all the girls out, we got pushed about a quarter mile away from where we were standing. @NUM4 Â½ hours later we were waiting then I see this boys head pop out a window of the music @PERSON3 and say," @CAPS5 girls!. After he said that about @NUM5 girls went crazy screaming. @NUM6 Â½ hours later from that, they started to let people in. The theater was cozy and warm for being out in the cold for @NUM7 hours @CAPS6 felt good. Iyaz Was the special guest to get us warmed up for @PERSON1. When he got out every girl was screaming their lung out! He sang the concert and @CAPS6 was a great experience for my first concert ever!"

One day during the @DATE1 my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was no where in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing. I stopped I felt my back pocket and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Any way, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stuned to see who it was. It was my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to @CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: @CAPS6 I 'm at @CAPS4. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait. In conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient.

Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced of the arm rest with every one movement. I had asked my @CAPS1 to hurry up @CAPS2 I wouldn’t be late. I had told her like I have a million times before, “@CAPS1, you know how much being on time for practice means to me.” @CAPS2 I sat there slummped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens @CAPS7 the time, I thought my @CAPS1 would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunatly, with every flip, I became more irretated. “@CAPS3 is she? Why is she taking @CAPS2 long?” @CAPS4 like these swirled in my head. Then, my @CAPS1 came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling, the garage door crecked open. My @CAPS1 started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed @NUM1, I for sure new that I wasn’t going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @NUM2 and took deep breathes. Taking lots of deep breathes helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. “@CAPS5 passient.” I told myself. “@CAPS5 passient. Relax, you’ll make it there.” @CAPS7 of a sudden my @CAPS1 slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read @NUM3. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself “see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and @CAPS7 you had to do was slow down and @CAPS5 passient. Great job”

I was patient when it was my birthday and I didn’t get anything. I thought I would get at least one thing but I got nothing. I didn’t do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing I didn’t ask for anything but I still got nothing. The next day I got nothing. But that night while it was skating at skate port @NUM1 got nothing. Like at @TIME1 I saw my cousin and she gave me @MONEY1 for my birthday. I thought that everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so happy too. I had to be patient in order to get something and don’t have to ask for something.

I v'e been waiting for like two hours. When am I going to get my food. I was hungry so I told my mom she asked me if I wanted to go out my cat I said sure and went and got my jacket on. Mom said I got to go get dad, wait in the car so I went and waited for them for like a minutes. When they finally got out dad asked ?????????Shouted @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He said ok and we went. when we  got there, there were no other stores that were open. When we went inside there were like a billion people in there. I was so hungry I could eat a pig. Metarorickly speaking. We went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two hours. After about @NUM1. I started to read a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went in those seats. We were next to go sit down but it took about an hour. Before some people left. I didn't complain at all and I didn't ever talk at all, and I talk a lot. And that was the time I was very patient.
<START>

One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!

Patience is sometimes hard to do if you are already exsited. But some time you are doing like if one of your family members is talking & you are waiting for something else that is patience

I asked my mom if I can get a phone but she said no, not yet. She said I cant have one till @NUM1 grade unless I get a @CAPS1 phone write now and cant till ninth grade to get a real phone. I told her okey. But when are you going to get it for me. She said you have to be patient. I told her I will but when she said as soon as possible like on @DATE1 . I said I’ll be patient till then and will not bug you about it. That’s one time I had to be patient.

One time me and my dad were at a store.There was a line about @NUM1 people my dad and I were starting to get impatient so I told myself to calm down and wait. But I was still not calming down then the very first person left and then was starting to calm down and just wait for the next person to go.

My finger tips were icy as I sat and wanted. The seconds tarried into minutes, turned into hours. My body heat escaping rapidly like sand in the winds. I frudged through the mud as the slick rain hammed on my skin. I should have waited. I was patient as they explained it. But I didn't listen. I should have waited. I should have waited, wait have I shoulded. The words mixed together. My bones cold, I was only about @NUM1 yards from home. My legs refused to walk as they shuddered violently. Wait, be patient, I reminded myself. A cop car in my parents' driveway. I shoved my left leg through the mess of leave and mud, patience wasn't a factor right now. Nine yards, eight, seven, six. I stopped, pulled my poud over my head but the wind and paid blew it off again, five, four, three, two, one. I was at my door step. I weakly raised my hand to knock. The @CAPS1. Fast foot steps, the door opens. I am showered with hugG. ''You should have waited!'' my dad cried, tears streaming down his face. I smiled weakly.

There was a person named @PERSON1. He wanted a video game for his @CAPS1- box @NUM1. But, his dad just got laid-off and his mom had a low-paying job. Since they had very little money, he couldn’t buy the game. A few months later, his dad finally found a job at @CAPS2. But, @PERSON1 still didn’t have enough money for the game. A few more months passed, @PERSON1 finally had enough for the game. His mom took him to the store to buy it. He was very excited. He ended up loving the game very much.

Have you ever heard your mom or dad say patience is a virtue. Well I’ve heard it many times in my house actually too many times. Patience is a something that means you have to wait like when you wanna go see a new movie on opening night, you might have to wait in a big line cause it’s a new movie. So your gonna have wait with patience!
<START>

A time that I was patient was during the @DATE1. My @CAPS1  @PERSON1 was nice enough to invite me to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with her family acoarse my pacents said yes. It was a @NUM1 hour @CAPS4 I think to @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS7 it was fun cuz we brought lots of things to keep us buisy, we watched a movien on my @ORGANIZATION1, listened to music I had no trouble waiting till we got there.

So it would useless to try to escape the line, then finally it was areturn to go, @CAPS7 it wasn’t working so we had to wait, it wouldn’t copperate so he told use that we can get free passes to go on any ride, and cut ahead of everyone @CAPS7 we only got to do it once.

Okay well if you don’t want to take my advice get hurt.

I chose write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my first time hunting, I was only hunting squirls but still. What I had to was walk in the woods and sit down once you sit down you cant move. So I was sitting very still for @NUM1 minutes and finally I seen a squirl. So I took my shotgun and shot her in the chest. I was patient so I got a squirl. So that’s my story on patients.

I was at the @NUM1 fair with my friends. There was a ride called the freak-out that we really wanted to go on. The line was to long so we decided to go on some other rides. We looked over at the line and all it was doing was getting longer. We decided to go get in line anyway. It felt like we were moving an inch every @NUM2 minutes, I had to be very patient. On the inside I was ready to go nuts but I was calm on the outside it was the longest @NUM3 minutes ever!!!!

@PERSON1 and his dad were planning on going fishing on that @DATE1 @TIME1. They got everything they needed fishing pots. Tackle box, fishing nets, bait, and lunch. They drove down to the lake, got into their small rowboat and were off. @PERSON1's dad was the first to catch something. He caught a ten inch small mouth bass. It was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet today. There was a small breeze in the @DATE2 air. The sun was up but it was still a little cold. The sat there quietly, patiently. @PERSON1's dad got another pull on his line. He quickly reeled it in. this time he caught a twenty inch pike. Another one too small so he threw it back. ''The fish are really biting today hu?'' said his dad. But the truth was they had been out there for an hour and @PERSON1 hadn't gotten a bite. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch. They just brought sand wiches, chips, and a few waters. When they were done eating they went back to fishing. @PERSON1 casted his line as far as he could get it to go. He sat and waited for about twenty minutes when he finally got a tug on his line. ''I got one. I got one,'' he told his dad trying to reel his line in as fast as could. When he got it in the boat, they measured it. @PERSON1 caught a fourteen inch largemouth bass. ''@CAPS1 like you caught dinner for tonight ''. Said his dad. They stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in with a fish dinner @PERSON1's patients caught him a good fish.

When I was patient I was in a store buying something and it was a long line so I had to wait to pay for my stuff I whas I was buying. I waited and the person in front of me had a big cart of food and everything else so I had to be patient when he was up after I had to wait for all of the people to get done paying food their food and anything else.

As  I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as I’m older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I don’t care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don’t want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and don’t say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help.

Once before I went to @CAPS1 point with my friend @PERSON1. I was patient on the way there. I was patient in line to get inside. I was patient in line to get on the dragster. I was patient to go on all the rides. Once I had to go to the hospital to get an echo on my heart. I was patient waiting for my results. I am always patient. Well most of the time. Once I went to @LOCATION1, I was patient to go through security. I was patient on the plane waiting to get there. I was patient to get off. I was patient for my luggage. I have to go to school. I am patient waiting to  lunch. I am patient for school to be over. I am patient to wait till class is over. Like I said I am mostly patient.

The best ride at @ORGANIZATION1 was over @NUM1 hours long wait. Bad news for me become I am definintaly not a patience person. Like this one time I was waiting in line for an ice cream. There was only two people in line but I didn’t want to wait so I didn’t want one anymore. That’s how impatience I was, but riding the best ride in the world I was willing to wait. Two hours of waiting in line we seen a sign that said one hour from this @ORGANIZATION1. Very mad I kept saying to myself it’s the best ride you can wait an hour longer so I did. When we got on the ride it was fun but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds longer

Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text. I accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! I am so glad I had such a caring teacher that found that for me or I would’ve failed! When I was sitting down at my desk quietly she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page. I almost flipped out but I held it back. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right. I’m very glad I have a good amount of patience.

Everybody loves @CAPS1, and they all have to be patient for it. Especially on the @TIME1 of @CAPS1 @CAPS3. Everybody in my family always gets very excited and can’t wait until morning, especially me. I get so excited I can hardly sleep. In fact, last year had to be the hardest. It was @NUM1 am on @CAPS1 morning and I had woken up for no reason. I decided to go back to sleep and did for only about thirty minutes when I woke up again. I just couldn’t fall asleep! I went downstairs with a couple blankets and tried to go to sleep when I saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there. I sat up and looked around at them. I was so excited but I remembered that I would have to wait until everyone woke up. So I tried to go back to sleep. I would close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time and eventually stopped trying. It was @NUM2 am. I turned on the @CAPS5, threw in a movie, and waited. At @NUM3 am most of my brothers were up and I couldn’t take it anymore. I snapped and started to complain. I had become very impatient. I finally was told yes and began to open my presents. I was finally happy.

One time when I was patient was when we were flying to @LOCATION1. We were in @LOCATION2 waiting. God I thought how long can this take. But evenaly the plane came.

I had my I-pod, a book, and the @CAPS1 in front of me. Once we were in the air I thought I would take a nap. But that only killed a hour so then I decided to watch a movie. I watched @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That took off another two hours. By then I was starting to get bored. I decied I would read. But after an hour and – a – half I finished the book. Then my I-pod come out. I listened to music until lunch came a hour later. After eating lunch which took @NUM3 minutes I decided to watch another movie. I watched @CAPS4 @CAPS5 which killed off enough @NUM4 hours. Then with only @NUM4 hours left I wanted to watch season @NUM6 of the office. Then when there was only @NUM7 minutes left when they cut everything down I watched us land in @LOCATION1. It was long but I was patient and stuck through it.

But I don`t  do that because I scared somebody would do it again. That is why I have patience.

Exclaimed my @CAPS4. “@CAPS1 I can’t either. I mean out of all- Were here! Man that was quick. As we rolled into the airport smelling that strafoam smell, and checked in our bags. “@CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 @NUM1, @CAPS3.” @CAPS4 explained to the clerk “@CAPS5 sorry according to this your @CAPS10 is full” she told us through a chessy smile. “@CAPS6 you called saying there was empty seats and invited us to exchange @CAPS2.” “@CAPS5 sorry @CAPS6 it wouldnt be fair if we gave away @CAPS2 that were rightful owned.” @CAPS8 again another chessy smile “@CAPS6 you can have your orginal @CAPS2 back if you like,” @NUM2 @LOCATION2. @NUM2!

One time my friend told me to read this book, so l borrowed it from her. The name of the book is called “The @CAPS1 @CAPS2”. It’s also a tv show on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was reading the books and one of the main characters named @PERSON2, brother of @PERSON1 are vampires. They turned into a @CAPS1 because of a girl named @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 died because they were trying to save @PERSON3, or so everyone thought. @PERSON3 gave them enough blood so they wouldn’t die, they would become a @CAPS1. They thought @PERSON3 was in the tume because that was were everyone was taking the vampires because the town found out there was vampires there. @PERSON2 came back after @NUM1 years searching for something to help get @PERSON3 out of the tume, I think that is patience. Waiting for @NUM1 years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you don’t complain while doing it.

When I was @NUM1 years old my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house and I kept asking my @CAPS3 “can we go to get pizza?” @CAPS1 every time I asked she would reply, “if you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza”. I didn’t want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, @CAPS1 after @NUM2 minutes, it got boring. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water. @CAPS1 I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to @CAPS3. “@CAPS2 are you and @PERSON1 done yet?” I asked. “Were done with the house @CAPS1 the car has yet to be washed” she answered. I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, @CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, @NUM3.m it said. My family always has dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at @TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rush to see if my @CAPS3 and sister were done yet, “Are you done?” I asked rudely. “You could help if you want it to faster” @CAPS3 answers. “@CAPS4, fine I’ll help”, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning we were done, @CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, “lets do!” @CAPS5 the whole day I waitd @NUM6 hours for my @CAPS3 and sister to finish @CAPS1 in the end I finished the job.

Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have.

One time I was patient because I was hunting it was a cold @DATE1 play I am sitting in blind with my dad waiting for a deter. It`s almost eight “o’ clock and we have been out there since @NUM1. We hear the ducks and geese making noises in the marshland next to us, we could see the trees dance in the wind. Smell the trash dance of grass and the morning fog. Then out at nowhere at @TIME1AM then came another doe. They went by us with caution so I got the gun ready. Then out came the eight point bunch I shot him through the heart and lung. I also gutted him. The year at @DATE2 in the youth hunt I was patient and it paid off.

@CAPS5 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 loved playing various games with her younger brother @PERSON1 @CAPS2! One day when she was playing sorry with @PERSON1, sadly @PERSON1 was taking an unpleasable amount of time on his turn. @CAPS5 was getting extremely angry at @LOCATION1 for taking so long. So @CAPS5 started scream. As you can imagine when @CAPS5 and @PERSON1’s @CAPS8 @PERSON2 heard this she ran to @CAPS5 and @PERSON1. She questioned @CAPS5 with a worried look on her face. She said to @CAPS5 “@CAPS5 dear, what are screaming about? I sure hope your not screaming at @PERSON1!” “@CAPS4 I was, but that’s only because @PERSON1 won’t hurry up!” @CAPS5 exclaimed. “@CAPS4 @CAPS5 says sorry to @PERSON1 then for being so sour and not letting him take his time. He’s younger then you, which means he doesn’t know any better.” @CAPS8, @PERSON2, exclaimed forcefully.”  I’m so sorry @PERSON1!” @PERSON3 said with a tear trickling down her cheak. So they gave each others hugs, and went on patiently with their game of sorry.

My name is @PERSON1, I’m in the @NUM1 grade. But the problem we have today is patience. One thing you have to know is that if have no kind of patience, you want get any where in life. Every where you go you need some patience. You will not have any friends when you do not be patient. Patience will grow you in life. Let’s just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office by two days. So when you do go you have to get your ticket number and sit, it might be for hours, but you cant just leave because if you do, you want get what you. Here’s another example let’s just say if you had to go to the doctor because your sick, you have to wait, you should because what if the doctor make you go pick up the medicine, @CAPS1 are some results about patience.

Pacience is a talent that is difficult to master. Pacience is a mental game. Pacience comes in everyones life. If you have no pacience then therefore you have more anger. Pacience for those minors stuck in a mine for two months. College takes a seal of years. Pacience is required there also. Pacience is among people everywhere whether it’s waiting for a toy or waiting for god  to save your pacience is something that will stay here forever.

This is a story of the time I was patient. It was four in the @TIME1, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silent. All of a sudden, I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, “it’s time to go, @CAPS1!” I replied “okay!” I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of @DATE1, and we were on our way to @LOCATION1. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the @CAPS2 player for me and my brother @CAPS3 to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies whele everyone else was asleep. Exect for my dad of course he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to @LOCATION1. I was ??? to  get there, I burst out of the car and yelled “finally” That was the story of how I Was patient.
<START>

The @TIME1 time I was patient was @TIME1. Because we had to go to @LOCATION1 city to pick something up and it took about @NUM1 @NUM2 minutes. Then on the way back we took another @NUM1 @NUM2 minutes on both trips it was boring. But I had to be patient also just this morning I had to be patient because my brother was taking a shower and I wanted to so I had to be patient because he takes like @NUM5 minutes. @TIME1 @TIME1 we  were having chocolate milk my mom gonna make it and we had to be patient for her to make it

Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short my family is really patient wether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient.

Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you don’t have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday.

It was a light breezey morning. It was @NUM1 @CAPS1, my parents were just finishing the packing for @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. We're going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose  ternament in @LOCATION2. It is a terrifying thirteen hour. We started loding to a van with are soutcases. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the @DATE1. That even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in are van. I ran back in the house and unpluged my @ORGANIZATION1 gamecabe.  I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on are trip. As we're just leaving I start pluging in all the wire and game controlles. The we start off. For the first coaple hours we just liscened to the radio. Then came the affect of my brother and sister owe never get going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @NUM2 hours this out and we were in @LOCATION1. We started seing mountains. They were wonderful. @NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the???movie for the last hour. The hour went be like a flash. Finally done that is a time I was sort of patient.
<START>

One time my @CAPS3 planned a fishing trip to @LOCATION1. @CAPS8 @CAPS1’t know. He told me to pack my suit case for three days worth of clothes I said why he said we are going to @LOCATION1 tomorrow with your causins @PERSON1 and ryan. I was so excited that I flew to my room and pounded cloths in my @CAPS2 and looked through everything I would need. I asked my @CAPS3 what we were doing there he said were going on a fishing trip in the @CAPS4 river for pike. The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a really nice underspin real. So I got my fishing poles ready packed my @CAPS7 and went to sleep so I could get up early. @NUM1 am come and my alarm went off I was so tierd I could barely see @CAPS8 we had to be at my uncles house at @NUM2 so I had to get ready. Once we got to my uncles house we met them then we all left. I wanted to sleep in the car @CAPS8 I couldn’t once we got in @LOCATION1 it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills we even sas a bear @CAPS10 a river that we stopped at then we went up river and there was a clear mud hole withe millions of frog in it. When we finally got there my @CAPS3 made me wait and unpack. Once me and my causin got @CAPS12 unpacking we went right to the store to fish my first cast I caught a little @NUM3 incher on a @ORGANIZATION1. After that we caught nothing so we came back up when it got @CAPS13 and roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next morning we got up early and only fished on the lake @CAPS10 the @LOCATION3 we caught nothing. That night we went fishing on the @CAPS4 river and we still caught nothing. The guy that owned the cabin said we should cath @NUM4 or @NUM5 pike a @CAPS5 @CAPS8 it had rained seven feet so they wern’t feeding. The next @CAPS5 we got up early again and fished all @CAPS5. In the morning I had one hit we had nothing afterward. At lunch we found a little @LOCATION2 to eat lunch on it had a actual rock cave and we had scared a bear off the @LOCATION2. Later we went to this little canyon that was really hard to clime I almost fell halfway @CAPS19 @CAPS8 I got looked on a root. We saw another bear eating berries that we video taped and we killed a chipmunk with a @CAPS21 rock that we threw @CAPS19. Wham it almost took my pole I fought it for about ten minutes I waited and waited it was a digantic pike @CAPS8 it shapped my line and I still have never seen that pike.

Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably could’ve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field.

For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunter’s orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in it’s place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience @MONTH1 not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things.

One time @CAPS1 mom took a test to become a @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients. I understoond because I get that feeling when I’m waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This is a time @CAPS1 mom showed patients for three whole days!

It can be really hard to be patient, depending on the effect. Even I lose my patience some times. But one time I was so patient that I was about to explode. On a dry @DATE1 day, my family and I decide to go on an exciting vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. We drove @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and headed east towards @ORGANIZATION1. After the boring road trip, we parked our silver mini van in a five dollar parking lot right next to the @ORGANIZATION1. First we went up the @CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from the incredible height. After that we saw our cousins. I never even saw them before. As we were looking at the waterfall my brother said, "@CAPS2, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?" "@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets." @CAPS4 my dad. We bought the tickets and went in line." @CAPS5 are there so much people?" I asked. There was about @NUM1 people waiting in line with us. "@CAPS6 be patient," my dad replied. I stood there looking at all the people in front of us. We were never going to get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets. After @NUM2 minutes we still did not get the jackets yet. We were moving as slow as the plates on the earth were. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet. My brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing, almost to explode. At last, they called us up onto the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall. We were in the mist. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was. Being patient has a reward at the end. Even though it is hard to be patient, I still did it and anyone can. I was patient the whole time in line to get in the boat. Patience can be rewarding.

In third grade one day it was one of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world.

?? It was a normal old boring day in the @DATE1 but I had just got a call from my sister in law. She literally just called me and asked if I wanted to go to cedar point the next day. I was astonished! I didn’t know what to say! At first I thought she was hiding around but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. ??? When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so greatful I could not fall asleep. I ended waking up at @NUM1 am and I was not to fond of that but it was totaly worth it. It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and ??? the mavric. The line was humumus but we waited. Half way into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. I’ve wanted to ride that one for ever. I was ??. We waited patiently for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours maybe @NUM4. I was hungry, trerd, and cooking in the sun. once it opened up again we only had to wail like ½ hour but all in all, it was worth it. My sister in law @PERSON1 was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever aten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was defidintly the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and @PERSON1, I think that’s why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day hind of sucked it was still our all a great time!

A A time when I was patience is when our family goes to @CAPS1 point. My family and I go to @CAPS1 point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds)  A couple years later the new ride The @CAPS4 opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didn’t. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we go to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing.I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines.

What is patience? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining most people are impatient these days. Patience is like waiting. For example, if you are in a traffic jam in a long line, or maybe you have to wait your turn for something. Patience is one of the best qualities someone could have. Every year more people become impatient. @CAPS1 want people to “hurry” or “move faster.” @CAPS1 need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience there would be no more conflict and if that happened some day, everybodies lives would be perfect.

Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. There were flys everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” @CAPS1 quickly replied. “@CAPS5! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “well I don’t wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might!” by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didn’t get front cart the wait wasn’t even that bad.

A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didn’t understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didn’t go with science, and he didn’t listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldn’t beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; @CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient.

Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacher’s help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient.

I am never patient. Weather its waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend I am never patient. The only time I can be patient is when im waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if im waiting for school to start. Then also the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I will run around the house for hours until a friend calls. ?? when they do call I rush right to the phone and answer it right away. I will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back til bed time so I will never have to clean my room.

My cousin was patient when we were waiting in line for the top l will @CAPS1 at (cedar point. The line almost took @NUM1 hours. My cousin was just simpily silent cvery unasul) and just waiting .I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet running around etc. I was about to die of boredom .My legs hurt, I was hungry, I was too hot. I just couldn’t stanistrn. She was just standing there not talking. When we started to move I got a little happier but still impatient. After @NUM1 hours we finally got into the ride. After the ride I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said for every word one of us said we have a minute of homework when we come back to @LOCATION1. I was stuck doing homework the next whole week. Thats how I learned my lesson to be patient

Being patient means that when your in a bad situation you don’t complain. Some people aren’t vary patient and some are very patient. In my eyes patience is very important, I likes to think of myself of sort of patient or I think I am. One time I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1 it was not fun. One bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privillage to go when you want get taken away then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself be patient we’ll stop at the next place. Another thing was you were alway hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times that was not fun. Also whenever you got food was not enough. But I did’nt complain. Lastly you just really want to get there you couldn’t wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. It seamed like we would never get there it was not the best experience. When we finally got there I realized that the trip was like a big test of patience and I pasted, and actually it wasn’t nearly as bad as the trip back.

Also when they gave me my ivy they missed my vain so the riped it out put it in my other arm so I was very patient for the pain to go down. Lastly when I was done at @NUM1 oclock pm and started at @NUM1 oclock am there was a big pice of tape on my arc for @NUM3 hours the nurse came and said "we can go home now" and said "you can take the tape off now swettie." I said "ok" I pulled it pice by pice then the nurse said 'herer lett me do it!' she said "@NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6" and pulled it off it hurt so bad but I was patient and didn't cry or???

SCHOOL!!!!!!! I haven`t ben acting right in school. I got my stuff together. Then I got the @CAPS4.

Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better.

Patience is a kind thing , people being patient, but still complaining about it thats not patience at all. Patience is waiting and being kind while your doing it. People that loose their patience easily really is not cool, its nice when someone waits for you if say your on the phone talking to someone else, or even on the internet or something. Its very poliete if you have patience, I don’t know the definition of it but am just gonna guess, I think its a person waiting patiencently and quietly on the other person even if they need to get somewhere.

Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don’t. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn’t stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over “stiff upper lip.” I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn’t work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. “I want to go home” I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said “@CAPS2” all grouchy. I had sniffled and said “I want to come home, I miss you.” and sniffled more. “Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.” @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1’s car. “@CAPS4 didn’t you want to stay?” @PERSON5 asked calmly. “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks.

I had to be patience many times. I had to be patience when my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum, I was waiting for x-rays, waiting to go on stage. These are sometimes when I had to be patience. When my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room.  It felt like forever. It was winter, I was in my pjs, and so bored but worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the emergency room for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, but they were very good at there job. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the tv they had. It was very cold in the waiting room plus I had @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my @NUM1 grade concert.  I was so nervous and the neeves kept growing. I waited for @NUM5 min but it felt like @NUM5 years. I was sitting next to my friend which helped a little. When we got on stage I song my heart out and was happy I waited. Those are sometimes which I had to be @NUM7. I am not good at being patience, but I waited and got good results.

Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That on main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is @CAPS1 mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull.??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check up. The @CAPS6 said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side I t means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her and she screamed ”@CAPS3 is going to have babies”then I scremed with her. We went and got dixixe and then we took her to the bark play and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now @CAPS1 was get bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be six months atleast until she has the puppies it`s aready been five and half, mom said, that she has milk now’ I told my sister, @DATE1 . “I wouldn`t doubt it,’ said @DATE1 then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today” then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now. “then we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said “oh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babies” we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright.” I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier. Tinker, bella, harmony and melony. I love my dogs!

Patience can lead to rewards, @PERSON4 the brown bear learned that @DATE1 when he was in line to get an autograph from @PERSON1. He might have been very frustrated but he just stayed calm and looked forward to meeting @PERSON3. One day @PERSON4 seen a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 headline in a newspaper. He put @NUM1 in the machine and opened the newspaper holder to grad one, it was jammed.  He went into the gas station to tell the people but they were not there, he hit the top of the bell and nobody came .@PERSON4 was trying to be as patient as possible .He went to a different store and got newspaper there.

When I was patient. Their was a time when I was patient. Their are more and more way’s I get @CAPS1 patient when I’m not in no hurry to do something. I’m going to tell you a true story when I was patient. And I was not in a hurry in get it done. My first day at school and we was having fun with a bunch of people and on that first day we had work. When we attended to do it some people was not patient. I looked around the bright room and I was thinging about how should I be patient, “@CAPS1 I said” to myself I have to take the time @CAPS1 I could reach a good grade and @CAPS1 I was patient. The next day I was ready to see my grade on that work. I had a fun that’s the day when I was patient and taking my time.
<START>

At time when I was patient was when I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was patiently waiting when to get on the rollercoaster. For an hour and a half. I was patiently waiting when I had to get something to eat. I was patient when I wanted to get on any of the rides. That is a time when I was paitient.
<START>

A time when iwas patient was a last @DATE1. My friend, @CAPS1, took me to cedar point in @LOCATION1. The place was so packed, it took five minuites to get from the car to the entrance. As we got in, the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream. They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on  was the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited, and waited for about ten minuites and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minuites and we weren’t even close to the ride! So we waited , and waited about ten more minuites, and things got a little faster. At this part, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenallen already. After we were strapped in, the person who locks people’s seats said “go!” and we took off like a bird. In the end, it was worth being patient
<START>

Have you ever been a patient? Like at the @CAPS1’s office?  Well let me tell you a time I have. One time I was really sick and I started crying because I was in a lot of pain. I was crying for an hour straight. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying. I told my mom that I stopped crying but she told me that I had to go see the @CAPS1.  When we went in we seen this man rushed to the @LOCATION1.  We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out she asked a man in to see her with his son. That gave us two seat to sit in.  After about @CAPS2 minutes she called us in to a medical room. She examined me and I was really scared because I might have nomonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office I was holding my mom’s hand. She came unto us holding piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection.  When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about ? @NUM1. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full, I felt like a pancake under another pancake.  When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about @TIME1 I got to have the lollypop. That was a time when I was patient.
<START>

One day @CAPS1 was ordering a dress with a pair of shoe s and a???. But when she was ordering it they said I???????????????? Part not legible it had not yet arrive??? you would????  Rosy said.”no thank you, I know??? arrive” said @CAPS1. The next @NUM1 months the dress had??? The magazine company called and said “we are very sorry for the late arrival of your dress, “ @CAPS3 we will offer no charge and thank you for your patiences.” @CAPS3 she ordered two more dresses and arrived the very next day that was still happy.

I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient.
<START>

Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. “@CAPS1 you can get it this time.” I encouraged myself. I stored at the net. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap!  I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I think. “You got this!” my entire team stared at me. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand. I will myself not even to look in the crowd. M y hand strikes the ball. It flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the  court. Since I was patient @NUM1 didn’t give up, I achieved my goal. This taught me one thing. Patience brings victory.

Patience is something you have to work on I do not have a lot of patience, I do not like waiting at all it is not fun .I do not like waiting ,because being patient is boring and five @CAPS2 feels like twenty @CAPS2. Then when you wait you start something and then as soon as you start its time. Waiting for package is the worst.  You wait and a sit and wait, then you forgot about it and then it comes .One day I was waiting to go to my friend house it felt like forever since I’ve seen her but it had only been about ten months .I missed her like crazy .We have been planning this “or weeks it was finally the day of get to go over @CAPS1 .Now I was only waiting on my dad to drive me @CAPS1 and he takes forever .Finally we got in the??? We were waiting five @CAPS2??? Then he gets months??? and drove away .I swear we got shopped at every red light from my house to @CAPS3’s house and got struck behind the slowest drivers so that made it werse .When we finally got @CAPS1 I jumped out of the truck ,@PERSON1 ran through the door down  then stars almost tripping down each one . She practically jumped on me we we hugging for like five @CAPS2. That is why I’m not patient.

My story is about a time I was patient. One day I was so excited because it was @CAPS1 and my friends and I were going trick or treating. I was so impatient for the clock to turn @NUM1 pm because my best friend @DATE1 was going to pick me up in her pink convertibable and we would go trick or treating. I was very impatient because it was only @NUM2 so I did my chores thinking time will fly by so I did my chores. Instead of putting dish soap in the dish washer. I put grapes in the dish washer @CAPS2 the dish was hoe was done I empted it and all the dishes smelled like grapes. So I  looked at the clock and it was only @NUM3 the I remembered that my favour  movie was on so I ran to my room but instead I ran into the wall and got knocked out. After @NUM4 hours I  was fine so I told my mom that I will be patient because I don’@CAPS3 want to get knocked ???on the bright side I told myself I only have @NUM5 hours and @NUM6 minutes to go so I went to my room + wasted some @CAPS3.V. until eleven twenty so I had an hour to get ready to go trick or treating but first before I did my make up I whent into the kitchen I put all the grape smelling dishes in the dishwasher and washed them them the I right way. Then I put my costum on I was a bumblebee, then I put my make up on I looked so cool. Finally the clock turned to @NUM1 suddenley I heard a horn @DATE1 was here. So I got in the car + we went to pick cate. I almost forgot to tell you that @DATE1 was a ladybug, cate was a which so then we whent trick or treating. So thats a time when I was patient.
<START>

I remeber, just a few days ago, my mother had to get her tooth checked out and guess what I did, I read a book! Even though it took forever, I was done with my @NUM1 minute homework. When my mom came back we got up to leave and my feet were name. So far my patience we got ice cream. So you could get rewarded if your just patient.
<START>

I must admit there are times when I’m not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was.I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My told me to be patient but I didn’t know what that meant so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, “You have to wart quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told her. I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also.
<START>

Being patient isn’t that hard if you try. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for ???. Five minutes past and they still weren’t don so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still weren’t done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done ??? was only two minutes. ??? well I guess I give it another try and if I still don’t get I’ll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasn’t making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said that we didn’t have to do that one and I laughed and told her ??? figure it out all yesterday. That is an example of bein patient
<START>

One day i spent a night over my bestfriends house for @NUM1 days and ended up going to school with her. Mind you all of my clothes and shoes were over her house still. I wasn’t really able to get my clothes because right after school I went out to eat. I was really angry because I left my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 shoes so I called her and told her to bring them to school.The next day i was really looking foward to getting them and I comforted her about it and she says she forgot so I gave her until the @DATE1 and she still didn’t give them back. Notice I was very patient with her and this was the month of @DATE3. I finally got them back in the month of @DATE2. Finally she gave the back and you will never believe that am still friends with her because my shoes were worn out and dirty but I had to realize that she’s a good friend and im a patient person.
<START>

A time where I was patient was when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a rush because I was running late. It was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 appointment was at @TIME1. I was at least @NUM2 minutes away from the place. When we got there it was basically @NUM3, so I missed @CAPS1 appointment. I had to wait in the waiting room for a long time @CAPS1 mother and I had to wait until all the people who made their appointment wer finished. We waited at least an hour an a half. As I was being patient I talked on the phone and went on the internet. Lastly I listened to music the rest of the time until they called @CAPS1 name. In conclusion this is a time when I was patient.
<START>

@LOCATION1 @CAPS10 sit down, my friend says. You don't need to be moving around like your a fly on tha wall." I sit down anxious to get up and move again." @CAPS1 's too many people here we're never getting in." I say. The line was the longest to get my driving test, so @CAPS2 thinking to myself to get up and move around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend think its annoying and awkward. "@LOCATION1, I wonder if they had a vending machine here." "I doubt @CAPS1," I proclaim. @CAPS3 glance at me and I turn away. I got up and I walked away. I came back @TIME1 and @CAPS3 was gone. I sat down and talked on the phone for a @CAPS13 @NUM1 I sat and looked at everyone wandering who to talk to because I was bored. I wanted to get up so bad and move around but I would look and @CAPS10 walking in a circle and plus @CAPS4 left. I sat and wait @NUM2 @TIME1 past and @CAPS1 was getting close to @NUM3.m. @CAPS1 was @CAPS5 @NUM4 and I'm @NUM5 so I knew I was next. "@CAPS5 @NUM5 your next." I think in my head like "@CAPS6." I get up and walk to the teller. "@CAPS7 you for your patience, now @CAPS12 can I help you" I looked at her and said, "@CAPS8 I would like a driving test please." When I got my paper to go in I thought to myself that I wasn't patient couse @CAPS1 seem like I was there for like a cazillion hours. I though again and think @CAPS8 @CAPS11 I was patient @CAPS1 was probably @CAPS3 that made me impatient because I had no one to goos off with. So @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I @CAPS6 was patient in like forever but I did @CAPS13 because I was ready to leave. "@CAPS12 was wait? The driver ad teacher says." @CAPS13 I felt patient enough to be there for about @NUM7 hours. This is the time I never knew but know I was patient enough to wait."
<START>

Patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient you wait for something with out complaining. If you are waiting for something and you start to complain that means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to not have patience. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for and it is important, and you have no patience that could be bad. Some people have good patience  but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. And that is what patience is.

This story is how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days. I have been patient by wanting to see what I get for my birthday even though it bugs me really bad! Also I’ve been patient because I’m having a sleepover with all my close friends. It seems like it is taking for ever. At my sleepover there is going to be cake and ice cream! “@CAPS1!” I’ve also been patient because im turning twelve which means I will be patient. Then the day after my sleepover my mom, me and my brother are going to the mall and then to the movies and I get a hundred dollars to speand. At the mall! It is very hard being patient to do fun things. Finally I’ve been patient by not asking everyone if they are coming. Some girls forget to ask their parents and it buss me because there is only two days left. This story showed how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days! But you have to be patient to do fun things I have learned just recently.

When I was little we went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was finally big enugh to go on the newest @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ! When we walked up to the line we noticed how many people were there. The line looked as if it were five miles long ! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there. This is what I had been waiting for ! I was not oppernutity. I told her I wanted to keep going and so we kept walking. It took what felt like two days to get to top. My mom and I were so patient !So we waited ,and waited ,and waited .Till we were finally at the top .Then we came down .It had been worth the wait ! we were so patient. I will always remember all the fun I had that day and the great accomplishment. I never knew I could be so patient and my mom and I could wait so long.

Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I hear “@CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2.” so I got up and checked it @NUM1 missed calls. I look who they are from at @NUM2 all from @CAPS6 dad. I felt something was wrong. I called him back and I hear” @CAPS1 get ready grandm @CAPS4 I coming to get you. “I said it`s @NUM3 @CAPS5 are you nuts?” at this time I was at a family members house @CAPS8 @CAPS6 dad said “@PERSON2 was in a bad crush.” @CAPS6 heart drop and I started crying.” get your stuff together and I will call you back with more info.” I got off phone @CAPS6 aunt was up she came into the room I told her what I knew. I was getting @CAPS6 stuff together try not ta wake anyone else up. When I was waiting for the call everything went through @CAPS6 mind. I was with him, what happened, is be ok is he going to die? @CAPS8 I heard beep beep I said good bye and ran out. Running made me think of more like: how bad is he hurt, what was he driving, what was he doing out? I got in the car I questioned @CAPS6 grandma asking her where is mom, where is @LOCATION1, where is @CAPS7 are they ok: when will I see him? All I knew in had to be patience. @CAPS8 I got the call I asked @CAPS6 dad “what happen what did he hit, who called @NUM4, where do we go?” the first thing that came out of @CAPS6 dads mouth was” calm down I can`t come home but @PERSON1 will be there I want you to stay with him ok” yes dad I will and dad” I said” you” he said back. I said ‘I love you.” “I love you too” he said. The worst time for @CAPS6 life was waiting for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were @CAPS6 dads when @CAPS6 dad wasn`t home. I know I would be fine with @PERSON1. How will be act seeing his bestfriend like that? @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are fire men I wonder if they knew who helped @PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hand to do but I had to be patience. I remember closing @CAPS6 eyes and wish it was a dream. Now I get to go in @PERSON1 right behind me walking I seem all the glass on him @CAPS8 dayna said look who is here he opened his eyes they got really big when seen me.” @CAPS8 @PERSON2 said @PERSON1 come here “@PERSON1 went. @PERSON2 said ‘thank you for taking care of @CAPS6 little sister I love you man.” That is the time in @CAPS6 life I had to be patience to see @CAPS6 brother. I didn’t care how he looked as long as he is ok.

There is this little patience I use a lot go I called it hunting patience. On @DATE1 my dad and I were hunting in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. we got into our stands baking over a @NUM1 yard bean feild, and not @NUM2 hours later two does walked in from our left they were coming close to @CAPS2. I was about to draw my bow when I look around and saw my dad waiting for @CAPS2 to shoot but when I look in the forest conner of our field I saw a big six point buck standing there not moving. I decied to be patient and see if the buck would come in. I saw I deer move into my blind spot where I couldn’t see it, I thought it might leave like that buck last year in my blind spot too. I waited for @NUM3 minutes, just when I thought he left I saw him again coming right for us. It was at @NUM4 then @NUM5 then @NUM6 and stopped. I looked at my dad and nodded to give him the sign to shoot. He under stood drew back his bow and let that arrow fly. The arrow, sailed into the deer and at that moment I know that because of patience we will have some good eating tonight with a party to honer the good days of hunting.

It was bright sunny day, and I was playing with my play doe. Finally I finished making my tower it took a hour fixing. I started at it in amazement. I was proud very proud at myself. I got out a piece of play doe and I made it into the “@CAPS1” I’ put it on the top of the tower. Well my five minutes of amazement was near its end @CAPS2! I look up to see that my tower was ruined . I look infront of me and see my neiber I told him why did he do that he said because it`s fun. I told him it`s fun for you but not for me. It took me an hour to finish it it`s a good thing I was patient. He looked down and said @CAPS3 sorry for what I did. I told him it all right, how about if we build it again but even better. He agreed and we both set to work. See how patience is important the problem could have become bigger. The end.

Once in @NUM1 grade my teacher @PERSON1 “asked us to get an A.M.P out.” @CAPS1 we all did and quietly we started to work. All of a sudden I was on my last prebblem and I was thinking “man already to the end.” @CAPS1 I started to work on it I was @CAPS1 confused this probblem was like seventh grade work. @CAPS1 I rased my hand and waited to go on @PERSON1 my hand and told me to go on in my math but I told her “I can’t go on I am on my last problem.”  @CAPS2 @PERSON1 went on helping all of the other students and I was waiting and waiting. Finally after she went to eight other people she came and helped me. She showed me how to do the problem and I figured it out. That was the time I waited patiently.

Once on @DATE1 break my family and I went to @LOCATION1. While we were at @LOCATION1 we went to a huge water park. My two sisters and I convinced my parents to go there. A few days later we went to the water park. We rented a locker, changed our clothing, and started looking for waterslides. Right as we walked in there was a huge (take) sunken ship. On the very to where zip- lines! We all ran to the ship and realized that there was a line. Not a short line. A giant line. We must have been there @NUM1 minutes waiting. Eventually it came my turn. I grabbed the handle and kicked off the ground. I had almost reached the end when it slowed to a stop. I let go falling into a pool. The wait was totally worth it!

“Patience is a virtue.” You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Here’s a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, I’m going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, it’s very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``@CAPS1” services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I can’t deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in very negative way. Those are the pro’s and con’s of having patience thank you for reading my essay.

One time when I was patient is when I was a little kid and my mom said we were going on a top to visit my cousins in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was just a little kid so I was very excited to take my first plane ride. When we finally got to @LOCATION1 I was so excited. I asked my mom when we got to the hotel can I go swimming. She told me to just be patient. So when we got to the hotel I was patient as long as I could be then I could’t wait anymore. So I put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. And that was a time when I was patient for something.

I am going to be writing a time when I was patient. Me and my family went to ceder point. and it was this ride called the @CAPS1 the best, and highest roller coaster at ceder point. So we got in line it was so long we had to wait @NUM1 to get on the ride, because the line was so long. So I had my uncle who wasent getting on the ride to go get me some pop, elephant ears, and some chips because I was so hungry and thirsty. So while I was being patient, my other family was not being very patient. I was the only one patient. So @NUM2 past we still in line my family started fussing. @NUM3 hrs past they were getting madder. Then @NUM4 hrs came we were starting to be able to see the roller coaster and people getting on and off. So finally, we got on the ride, we enjoyed it. Then I had to explain how patient I was.  And how unpatient they was not.

One day there was a man who was not patient at all. He thougt that everything he wanted would come to him right a way. His name was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 soon reliesed that not everything came right when he wanted it. So he got really mad when he saw a house for sale, it was a really nice house. But the people living in the house weren’t done moving everything out of the house. Then he discovered that patience is key and that when it’s time to move in he will. So from that point on he was always patient for the rest of his life.

I have been patient many time here are a few of them. First, I was patient for my friend. I patient with him because we were going to walk to school. He told me one minute, but it was more like twenty. We barely made it to first hour. Another way I was patient was when my mom and I went to go get my new shoes from @ORGANIZATION1. When my mom and I were waiting the man in the store went to go get the shoes. The man walked back there and took like a half an hour. But it was worth it for my new shoes. These are only a few ways I was patient.
<START>

Patience is like waiting for something and not froaring out. Imagine if no one had patience everything would suck. Picture this your at the store there is a line at the register, no patience and people are fighting to get to it. Knowing that most people have patience that would not happen. Since the people have patience the world has order so if you think about it it's a good thing.
<START>

A time when I was patient was on the city bus. So me and my mom could go to walmart. We waited for @NUM1 hours till we got there. Before we got on we had to pay a @MONEY1 each. Then ask for transfer very nicely. T hen hop on another bus then get off and go shopping. Then wait till bus comes back and go home after @NUM1 hours. Then get of bus at the corner and walk back to the house.

Just before @DATE2 break, in the fourth grade, there was a @CAPS1 party at my neighbor’s house. My parents and I were invited, and since we didn’t have plans, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room. Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didn’t understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper away… and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders. Inside was a note: @CAPS7 only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience. Now I understood.
<START>

This is the time when I was patient. One @DATE1 day I was playing with my @CAPS1 @NUM1 game, I told my mum I wanted a new game, because my games were kinda old. My mum said "@CAPS3 sweetie just be patient" I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wanted a curling machine she got that to. So I just keep waiting and I was also patient. My dad came back from @LOCATION1, and I asked him. I said, "dad can you get me a new @CAPS1 @NUM1 game?" "@CAPS3 honey but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient." "ugh okay!" I hollered to the next day my dad had already gotten what my brothe and sister wanted, and I was the only one who my dad and mom that never gotten my game yet. So I still waited, and waited until my dad took me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother gotten what they wanted. I still got my game. Waiting is not that hard just takes patience. Thats how patience helps you ecomplish what you want.

To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at a airport then canceld it was not very fun because I didn’t eat all afternoon. But I was happy because I had my ds. The story was we went to @LOCATION1 on the @NUM1 for vacation to disney land. It was snowing when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the check line and the security. When we got to the boarding gat we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed that ment we had to stay here in the airport. I aleast saw that we were going to new @LOCATION2 first then to @LOCATION1 but I stayed patient. Well that’s the day I stayed very very patient.

I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while.

A time I had to be patient was when we went to @LOCATION2. It was a @NUM1 hour flight with a two hour layover in @LOCATION1. It was really hard for me to be patient because I really wanted to go to @LOCATION2. In the layover to pass time I listend to my ipod and used my macbook pro to get on face book. It really helped me be patient because it took my mind of @LOCATION2 and we were in @LOCATION2 in know time, and when we arrived my patient’s paid of because I got to swim on beaches and party I @LOCATION2 for @DATE1 break @DATE2 that is my story about a time I was patient.

A time when I was patient was when I waiting in the hospital One time when my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing. When we got to the hospital we couldn’t go and see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, uncle were just sitting waiting very patiently. When the next day came we still couldn’t see her which was sad and scary. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we came back to the hospital my mom was very upset because we couldn’t see her at all. The doctor came out and said we can see her. When we got into the room she was sitting up smiling. My mom told her that it took forever for us to see you. My granny scud the doctor said it wasn’t a really big deal. We stayed at the hospital for like @NUM1 more hours and then we left but my mom stayed.            In conclusion I told you when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we wanted to run in but we didn’t and we stayed very calm. This is the time I was patient.

Being patient is a good thing. Sometimes impatient @CAPS1 sometimes im not its better to be patient. My cousin is patient so when I tell her to wait and be patient she will wait as long as she want. My other causins tell me to be patient and I will just be waiting for a while and I ask then hurry and they tell me to learn to be patient. My cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient and we tRied. So now I can stay longer being patient.

I was in class waiting  I new that it would come soon. The time was almost here, but I was still waiting for the first class to yet over. Which was math. Personally I didn't like math all that much so unfortunately l had to wait. @NUM1 more minutes and l was home free. The time had come and l was happy. @PERSON1 said "@CAPS1 your folder away" @CAPS2! I @CAPS1 it away faster than I can say supercal fraja list expeal & docinus. So then in his voice he said "You @MONTH1 go to lunch" I hurried and I was going to be the first one there I almost thought I wasn't patient enough but l was. I booked it there home free. When l relized a figure in front of me. "no" l said. I was defeated by a girl! I was devastaded that is my story and I'm stick to it.

When most people think of patience they think of waiting. But that’s only half of it. Patience is waiting with out complaining, like when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was about a five hour drive. I know that doesn’t seem like a lot but I @CAPS1 corridor. I just @CAPS1 them pure and simple. But me and my brother didn’t complain, mainly because the knight before our mom said two complained well sit with her in the hotel room the whole time. Isnt that scary,” so we finally go there .The week was fun, we ate good food played sweet games and wen’t to an awsome  museum. But on the ride back it was another trial of patience, even more so because we got in an accident.
<START>

In @DATE1 my dad had a business trip in @CAPS1 dinsney land. We got to the park and rode some rides .My dad had to leave for a meeting, so he did. After a while I saw something cool, space @CAPS2. I got in line and I saw a sign, @NUM1 hours until lift off! My mom was shocked so we left. I was so disapointed. We came back the next day and the wait was @NUM2 hours. We got in line and waited and waited and waited. After @NUM3 minutes I was bored. I asked my mom if we could leave but the line was to big to get out. After hours that seemed like years we got to the front, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom got out of line and so did my sister, but I stay. I waited all by myself for @NUM4 minutes when I got on the coaster! It was fun, and I got a fastoas for @NUM5 other rides! In the end my patience paid off.
<START>

It was late @DATE1  when my @CAPS1 is and I was going to @CAPS2 point for my @CAPS1. So we take forever  to drive  there just sitting in the back sent all alone back there no one to talk to but my phone. So we finally get there wasting all my patients on being in the car after we get in we go on the @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5 wait to ride a @NUM1 minute ride it is worth it but still @NUM1 hours is a lot of time. So I m waiting then we get off the ride they we go on the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 line for @NUM5 second ride. All the rides there  were at least 1-@NUM1 hours long. Except one ride the @CAPS7 we got there before the crowd  came in. So it was on leg @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 the time we got on the ride and at the top of the  hill it was probably a @CAPS5 line. So we really lucked out on that one. But @CAPS8 the time the park closed and we got to our car there was a huge traffic jam and that was all the patients left so we were in line to leave the park  for another @CAPS5 and a half so we waited and waited and finaly it moved and once we got through the park and out of it the road we had to take was  closed because of a car accident so we had to talk this huge detoer  that added a @CAPS5 to our time  because of traffic taking that way and @CAPS8 the time we got to our hotel I didn’t have one drop of  patients left I felt like I was going to blow up but I didn’t I acted very patient but it was a good thing I have a lot of patients.
<START>

A time when I was patient, was when I went to @CAPS1 point with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friend @LOCATION1. We rode some rides, then @CAPS6 sister said “can we ride the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 again?” I replied “sure, even though it was our fifth time riding the ride. @CAPS6 sister and I went and stood in  line for the ride. I said “we should ride front row.” @CAPS4 said “we should.” @CAPS5 we went to the front row and the line was packed. @CAPS5 we waited twenty minutes or @CAPS5 when someone threw up on another cart. The employies had to clean up the barf, which took another twenty minutes. @CAPS5 we kept waiting and waiting un till they let us on. After the ride, I exclaimed “who would barf on a ride like @CAPS7,” @CAPS6 dad replied “I don’t know.” @CAPS7 day is a day that I rember @CAPS6 patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that wasen’t worth the wait. What was worth the wait is seeing the smile on @CAPS6 sister’s face and her laughing.

I know a lot of patient people, and I have had many expierences that have to do with patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she is waiting for something she texts me saying, “@CAPS1!” or, “@CAPS2 onnn!” @CAPS3 one day she was actually very patient. My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and @CAPS3 go to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, and it was already @NUM2 am. We were running late and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunatly, @PERSON1 wasn’t mad! She was understanding and said that it was ok. Usually, she would say something like, “@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long?” @CAPS5 time she didn’t say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I have had expieriences with many patient people and @CAPS5 expierience turned out to be fun!

I think patience is all about waiting for something you want to happen or you don’t want to happen. Sometimes it hits uninspected. Specaly at cedar point you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my force so I hope the thing would turn off. Butt @DATE1 I was going to cedar point and I coun’t wait. So I got up took a shower and ate breakfast which was great my mom made blueberry mudines.  I got all of my close pack a week early because, I was so edsited. I put my clothes in the car and my brother, sister, mom, dads so we could get going quicker. The car ride wasn’t so grate because, it was three hours long but we had a tv in our carso it didn’t take as long as it normally does because, were occupied so it is like a shorter car ride for my brother sister and I. When we got into the howtell it was awesome because, it was like @NUM1 storys high. And we also had to use the elevator to get to our room ont @NUM2 floor. My sister was amazed by all of the stuffed animals and wainted to buy the furry things but she couldn’t. My mom woke us up come on the rides open in about @NUM3 min we got be there. So I raced up out of bed running around like I got fire on my butt trying to find my clothes. So found all of my clothes and raced around to get my shoes on the others side of the bed. So by the time we were all up dressed and showered the rides have been going on for an hour so we walk over to the gate and got the one ride called million ofcare. The sigh said @NUM4 hours wait sorry the ride is know just to got started because of difficutys  with the seatbelts and others technical difuctlelys sorry. So my mom said wait here at ride it is realy fun. So was waited and waited I have no patience any more I will buy you a hot dog after this so I did and the ride was a blast @NUM1 hours at the park. Was fun but we had to go tomorow. And I got my hot dog.  That was my story of being patience at cedar point when all is you want to do was have fun. Sometimes you got to be patinced to get what you want.

One hot @DATE1 day my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. There was a new ride open called shoot the rapids. It was a brown tall water ride with a tunnel and two hills. As we walked over to see how long the wait was it said @NUM1 hour wait. We all really wanted to go on it so we decided to wait. When we got in the line it was about @NUM2 outside, we were all sweating. And to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. It was really annoying. We were about half way threw the line when my nerves kicked in I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and suck it up. About @NUM3. Later we were @NUM4 people away from the ride. My heart was pounding, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait another @NUM5. As time past we finally got on the water ride. I regret it. I screamed and cried but I’m glad.  I didn’t chicken out. That was a time I had patience and regret it.

One time I had to be really patient when my grandma said there was something in the mail for me. I was so excited. I waited and waited but nothing showed up. Then I started getting unpatient. My grandma said “@CAPS1 keep waiting it will come soon”. So I did what my grandma said and the next day a big package came. I was so happy it was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and I some new sneakers. Also we all got @NUM1 players. I was so happy that me being patient had finally been something worth.

Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go throught it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and me and my two younger brothers couldn’t wait to get to @LOCATION1. We got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there we found out we had to wait @NUM1  hours until the plane left and we’d be on our way to @LOCATION1. So we decided to play our games we brought with us. We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into speakers “I’m very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we @MONTH1 not proceed until it clears up.” @CAPS1!? “@CAPS2 long will it take?” asked my mom.” About five hours, “she said. It’s a good thing we brought our @CAPS3 player so that would hold us off for about two hours. For the rest of the time, played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we very patient for the whole five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five @ORGANIZATION1 world pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter @CAPS2 hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family.

I was the first one in line but then I was folowed by other people olny one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I was up next I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana, pepper, cucumbers and great frech spinach.   It rearned something in that line being patient realy pays off and by the time in at back. It had over been @NUM1 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first games we played starta we tied it though but that was still a great day!

About @NUM1 weeks ago I order a look series at border online, I had to be very patient so it would feel like @NUM2 year of waiting. This book series was not like any book series @CAPS1 books are my favorite book they’re call the @LOCATION1 series. I have read the series @NUM1 times and I am still reading them. But, I had to wate to get them. I trying to patient, but it was hard. The mailing date said in less than @NUM4 hour. I had to wate for @NUM5 day before it a came, When I forget about them they come! Being patient is a good qulatie people can have. So if your  patient you will probably get what you want.

A time that I was patient was when I took my first @CAPS1 test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about one and a half hours left. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a @NUM1 year old, imagine @NUM2 minutes! At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the @CAPS2.E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those @NUM2 minutes.

Hi my name is @PERSON1 and I’m going to tell you a story about how one time I was patience. I remember when I was patience. It was chismis day. There was tons and tons of precidens under the tree. There was tiny ones all the way to hamuges ones. But I couldn’t even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up. I wanted to go into my mom’s and dad’s room and wake them up. But no without some brekfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so can open my precidens. After my mom and dad were done eating I finally got to open my precidents.

Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4’t have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but here’s a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like there’s no tomorrow. To bad I couldn’t play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience..” @CAPS1” ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face. “ @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing “he added. “@CAPS4’t get to happy , there’s still plenty of time left.” I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I ‘d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, “who is the loser now, huh?” wow all it took was patient, and hope” I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate what’s happening around you, you’ll end up getting rewarded!.

I guess you could say that patience is one of my bang talents. I go through many things that involve patience and a ve it through without awed .

Boh  so  I  know that there  are  a lot of  kids  that  went  as  patent  as  me, some  of  them have  @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of  other lirastings  that  make  them  impatient while  others  in   just  ????  you are.  I know   ???  People who are like that there reals anersetic????   ????  can’t  here still  I know that   wostoe  there  nopele  struggle  in  school and  I feel  bad  foe them.  There are times that start to feel impatient when there are other people????  that are impatient. Its  worst  is  I sat  impatient  with them  and I set  frustrate  because  no  matter  ????  ??   times  I  tell them to   stre tuppin, there pencil  as  to stop complaining  the just  don’t  stop.

There was a fish named @CAPS1. @CAPS6 live around the @CAPS2 archipelago, a dangerous place for fish that couldn't slow down quickly. Luckily, @CAPS1 was the legendary many codscanth all that specif does is float slowly. Yesterday, @CAPS1 caught two fish and gave them to his wife. Today all of fish are in the desert, which @CAPS1 absolutely despises. Using his patience, @CAPS6 waits for something to jump out. Suddenly, @CAPS6 sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny. At was too far away to grab, though. @CAPS6 went home to his wife. The next day, @CAPS6 went to the current and saw the floating meat again. @CAPS6 lunged for it and started chewing when something stabbed him. @CAPS1 started pulling fiercly when @CAPS6 heard a snap. When @CAPS6 tugged again @CAPS6 fell into the current. @CAPS6 was finnaly free! @CAPS6 also realized the current felt pretty nice. @CAPS6 ate a couple of fish and slept. When @CAPS6 woke up, @CAPS6 saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins. @CAPS1 couldn't breath and @CAPS6 was in a not @CAPS6 snapped at one of the fins of the other fish and died.

In sports you always have to be patient. Like if your not making any shots or someone is getting the best of you. If your patient and keep working hard sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient in his basketball career. At @PERSON2 high where he went to high school he wasn’t the biggest, fastest, the strongest, or even the best, but he was patient. When he was a @CAPS1 in high school he frield out for the varsity, but didn’t make it. He was so upset with himself and the coaches because he felt like he should’ve made the team. His mom went fo him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids @PERSON1 didn’t quit or tell himself that he wasn’t good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard. All that worked paid off because the next year he made the team. He went on to go @LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a game winning shot. He went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3’s were one of the worst teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple seasons @PERSON1 stayed calm and on to win five more championships. In his last one @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. The @CAPS2 were getting tired though. They went down in the series @NUM1. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting. Finally the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some tough situations, but he stayed patient and played like an all-star.

My mom is very patient woman. She shows it by helping my brother @PERSON1, with his homework. @PERSON1 hates every thing about doing his homework. He hates, doing his math, reading, but most of all he hates, spelling. When my mom is helping him with all three of thoose things she shows patience because since he hates all of thoos homework assignments he doesn’t always do them without a sit. When he does throw a fit she is very patient with him and works on it with him until he is done that is how my mom shows patience.

Waiting to be the best. Music is pretty much my life, I love the way A song can make you feel, I love how walking a line on the @ORGANIZATION1 can change your day. As a young musician I all I can ever think about is music, I had reache my @NUM1 instrument @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, the only instrument my family owns I can’t play is the bass. So when my @ORGANIZATION2 broke I took mr.groth up on his need for a @CAPS3 in @CAPS4 band. I studied my butt of learning the art of the bass @ORGANIZATION1, reading the clef and learning the notes, I was waiting for my ranking to increase and memorization and I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I soon became better and it seemed each week I got better and better. I had easily fell in love with the sounds it made and I had found  I  loved it way more than the @ORGANIZATION2, shure it will take time to become a pro but I u learned its worth it .

My dad came up with the name @CAPS6 @CAPS3 liked it so that was his name I had to wait a whole week before I could take him home but as long as I got my puppy I was fine @CAPS3 got him a toy when @CAPS3 went back to see him I had it with every night knowing I was closer and closer to getting him the day finally came. @CAPS3 told my brother @CAPS3 were going fishing since he didn’t know @CAPS3 were getting a dog. But once @CAPS3 there I ran inside to go see him @CAPS3 took him home he was afraid of everything even leaves outside. But @CAPS7 he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow.

I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @LOCATION1 their was a @CAPS1 line. I was in the mall and from where @LOCATION1 was it went all the way to the street. It was @NUM1 and my bedtime is @NUM2 so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was all ready @NUM3 after @NUM4 and the line didn’t even move. I was so mad. Every @NUM5 the line would scoot to a bit. When I was about to leave the line just started going up like a boom-army. @CAPS2 when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me a airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. @CAPS2 all I wanted to do. And I think @LOCATION1 would give me good airsoft gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my guys as were next is. We went to???.  I ask him what I wanted and he said “you’ll shoot you eye out side.” @CAPS2 when I got mad because it had to be so patient. That is the last time I’m going to visit @LOCATION1 at the mall.

The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you don’t ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you don’t get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you don’t get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you don’t get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosn’t pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something that’s a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because, if you maybe wan’t to have a job as a theropist you need a lot of patients. Those are some definitions of patients.

My grandparents had just picked my brother and  I up from our house to go get @CAPS1 @CAPS2 at cold stone. I never gone to cold stone, but my friends said it was good. So I had asked my grandparents if we could go. I was amped. When we arrived at our destination the line was huge. It was shaped like a snake. The sign said “@NUM1 minutes wait.”I was disiported. I was about to leave when I saw it. The peanut butter @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was staring me right in my face so I I talked to my grandparents and said we could stay. When we finally got to the front of the line I orderd peanut butter @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was time to send my taste buds on vacation. It was fantastic  @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was so smooth. I was thinking to my self how I was glad that I was pacient to envoy that amazing @CAPS1 @CAPS2. That was the time I had to be pacient to go get a fanominall @CAPS1 @CAPS2 bowl.

Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experience difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do @CAPS11 I did it before. “@CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2, this isn’t even moving.” @CAPS3 brother and @CAPS3 broter obvousilly wasn’t being patient. Hello, @CAPS13 me mame, I mean man, can you walk any shower? “@CAPS4, I can if you want me to.” A nice man said in a kind friendly voice to @CAPS5.” @CAPS6, are you that dumb, I wasn’t for real. I m cut you just because of your stupuidity .” @CAPS5 said, trying to act all tough. @CAPS5 was only a year older than me (@NUM1) and he thinks he’s all big and can di anything he wants. “@CAPS8, little man you can’t cut me, I was waiting in line forever.: that nice man said to @CAPS5. “ well , too bad .” while @CAPS3 brother was  making eniesnes, was waiting patiently in line even though the line wasn’t really moving, inside I wanted to out every one @CAPS11 not like some people I have patients and can wait. After @CAPS3 brother cut that man and didn’t get punished he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very very mad at @CAPS5 @CAPS11 not one did anything besides say,” @CAPS8 don’t cut me.” @CAPS11 that didn’t’ really help. Intill @CAPS5 cutted the @CAPS15 person. That person was a young pretty body with beautiful blue eyes and has such pretty blond hair, her name was @PERSON1  “@CAPS13 me police man, this  young , little boy just cutter we and every one else. “@PERSON1 said. While I was waiting there patiently, @CAPS5 got kicked out of the whole park’ @CAPS15 in line please, “  “ @CAPS1 that’s me …. Won.Were “was the best roller coaster I had ever been on. Being patient is hard @CAPS11 can be rewarding. I also learned to be patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerant. Now, @CAPS16 know you get the best when your patient. And the worst when your not.

A kid in my school, @PERSON1, has had a crush on my best friend my coarse for who knows how long. He has asked her about fifty times. She likes him as a friend but nothing more. She has dated many guys since @PERSON1 first asked her out. Mycaela can be a little boy obsessed.In fact she is now dating a boy who I asked out two days ago, sorry of topic. Anyway, @PERSON1 is always very patient, hoping mycaela will come around someday. It’s been almost two years with him stalking her and she still hasn’t come around. I just think that @PERSON1 is very patience and be is a great kid.

One time I was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for about at least @NUM1 hours. We were in the car on our way to @LOCATION1.  I was waching my dog on my lap for the @NUM2 hour.  The second hour I was sleeping.  The third hour I was waching a movie and by this time I had to go to the bathroom really bad.  Then by the last hour in a half I was to leget tearing up I had to go so bad t by the time my mom got off the phone we were at my aunt’s house. I leget ran in t ran into the bath room and then I was fine.

Im @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced with kids. I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasn’t told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited. I had to have patience with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack to this day I am still unpacking. Being a foster takes a lot of patience. I learned that.

There was a new restaurant opening in town! He really wanted to go so his family went. It had opened @NUM1 minutes ago. They didn’t think there was going to be a line. They got there and they didn’t see any cars in the drive thru. They went through the drive through which started at the back of the restaurant. Then they say about @NUM2 cars. He was really mad. They were about to leave and then there were @NUM3 cars behind them, so they stayed in line. Since it was a new restraunt everyone was picking their food very slowely. They where also making the food very slowely. Then people started yelling, “@CAPS1 up,” they where also honking their horns but he was the only who wasn’t honking his horn. They where waiting for @NUM2 minutes and @NUM1 had gone @CAPS3. He was starving and he still was being very patient. He usually is not patient. He was very excited to eat at the new restraunt.  When it was his turn the cashier said, “@CAPS2 you for being very patient.” @CAPS3 the time they got their food it took @NUM6 hour. The food wasn’t even good! He showed a lot of patience that day. He didn’t honk his car horn and he wasn’t yelling. He had stayed in the car @NUM6 hour and he was starving. It is a great thing to have patience.

This is a story about patience, pateince is when someone gives you a older or specific job to do. Then you do the job or order with no @CAPS1 askd even if you dont wont to do it last week my mom told me to cleam the living room even know it was hard I still did not it. Even know I did not want to do it was unfair

Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, it’ll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have.
<START>

I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read. This is because books sometimes take a while to read and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish it. That's exactly why l believe patience is important.

One time I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast while we were there. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had. I thought to myself “nothing will get in my way” well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival is saw this new ride. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got infront of me. That’s when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited  as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only @NUM1 minuets. People kept on going ahead of me. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasn’t so bad. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought was gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they I was gonna say something.

Every day I must be patient in difficult things. I must be most patient when I am playing or watching sports. Every weaken my brother play in a play football league and it can bewaring. I have to bit almost two hours for the games to be over and my parents make me wat in the game. My favorite speed is football and since I am a first base man and an eat fields; I have to wait of the ball to ??? so that  I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the meap because it is a long so and I must wait until people are we done. As you can see, I am very patient are have to be in many situations.

Frezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk with themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and @CAPS7 hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tooth time. “@CAPS4, I got it!” @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say joining them into my pockets. “@CAPS6, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said, “@CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”

A time I was patient was when I had to baby sit little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else.

Ugh, what is taking the gym teacher @CAPS14 long? @PERSON1 whined. "@CAPS1's been hours" "@CAPS1's only been @NUM1 minutes." @PERSON2 said. "@CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS1 has felt like its been a couple of hours." @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS4, you just have to have a little patience." @CAPS5 explained. "@CAPS6" @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS7 you sit here and have your @CAPS14 called patience I'@CAPS8 be putting my bag on the stage." @CAPS9 @PERSON1 got up everybody tried to tell him to sit down but all he did was ignore them. "@CAPS10'man man just sit down and have patience "@PERSON2 said "@CAPS11, I've been waiting to long I'm bored I'm tired and my feet hurt!" @PERSON1 yelled @CAPS9 he was walking behind the stage. "@CAPS12're gonna get in trouble." @PERSON2 said, looking down. "@CAPS13 was just yelling:" yelled the gym teacher with an angry face. The gym teacher looked to his right and saw @PERSON1 behind stage and said "@CAPS12 couldn't played basketball but @PERSON1 messed @CAPS1 up for everybody." @CAPS14 nobody played because @PERSON1 didn't have any patience. @CAPS14 I hope today he'll have a little more patience hopefully.

I woke before school started getting ready, grabbed all my stuff and walked out. When I got to school I sttarted hanging out with my friends and having a good day so far. At around @NUM1, @NUM2 hour is over and we go to lunch. I wasn’t hungry and I wanted to go with my friend @CAPS1 she wanted to eat so I waited for her and we went outside afterwards. When we go outside we like to do back walkovers,handstands,backbends,fronthandsprings, cartwheels and stuff like that. After the bell rang in @NUM3 hour it was recourse I wasn’t feeling good, I was hungry. I just wanted to go home and grab something to eat but we still had to wait till recourse was over then we had to ride the bus for about an hour. When I finally got home I didn’t feel good, my dad asked me whats the matter I told him I was hungery and it was around @NUM4 and he said we have to wait untill mom gets home my mom gets home at @TIME1. I had to wait and be patiant for @NUM5 hours and I realized its ok to wait because it was a delicouse dinner and if i would have ate something else before dinner i probly would not have aten any of my dinner and if I would have ate something else before dinner I probly would not have aten any of my dinner. And that was a story with @NUM6 examples of me having to be patient.

There haven’t been many times were I was patient but I’m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that!

Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go a friend's house. Savannah dad is a firefighter and he had to put out of fire a could not pick me up to the next afternoon. I was sad. It was the middle of @DATE2 and I haven't seen savannah in @NUM1 months. That day I learned Patience is a way of life people have to live with and this is the time I had to live with it.
<START>

There I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on a @DATE1 standing in the blazing sun. I could feel the sweat drip off my face. I looked ahead there was a least two hours left for standing in line for the roller coaster. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @CAPS7 was silent because they were getting irritable. All of a sudden this guy screamed, “@CAPS6 up!” @CAPS7 in line started screaming at each other except for me. I didn’t want to yell because it would get @CAPS7 worked even more. A hour later everybody chilled out. Then I looked ahead. @CAPS10 were almost to the front. I wiped my face and smiled. Then I said, “@CAPS8 hoo!” @CAPS7 looked at me like I was from a different planet.  My ??  “what?” my mom asked.  “@CAPS10’re almost to the front!” I replied.   Then @CAPS10 were next to go on the ride. When @CAPS10 entered the ride I fastened my seat. Next the ride took off! The breeze felt good against my face. When the ride ended I said, “ I knew patients: would pay off.” That is the time I had to have patients.
<START>

It was blistering hot, it had already been an hour in line, “when can we go?” I asked in a moining voice. My parents replied “just be patient were almost at the front.” @CAPS1, that ??? I what I did. My body ??? aching from walking around all day, but that wasen’t going to stop me from all these rides. Ten more minutes had passed and I began to get thirsty. My @CAPS3 and sister want to go get a drink with me while my mum held our s??t in line. We made it to the booth. “I’ll take water” I said, ??? realived. I said thankyou, as I grabbed the ice cold water from his hands. As we all started walking back towards the line, I spotted a bright colorful shirt that said, “@CAPS2. I couldn’t help but ask, “@CAPS3 can I please get this shirt?” we still have to wait a little bit longer in the if we go back. “@CAPS4 he responded but let’s hurry up @CAPS1 your mom dosen’t get impatient. After I got the shirt we walked back in the line. Thank goodness we were the second ones up. All aboard the mummy ride.” The person controlling the ride explained. We walked on, being patient payed off, because I had a feeling this ride was going to be a blast.

I was really hungry because I didn’@CAPS1 have any breakfast. @NUM4 am still in waiting. I couldn’@CAPS1 do it. It was so bored until I remembered I had a @CAPS2  @CAPS3.S in my pocket. So I took it out and started to play it. Time went past fast. That’s the time I was patient.

Patience is truly the hardest thing and body really ? that a ?.I hard to because im on punishment for not doing what I was suporse to do. So I have to be patient it and what it out until it was being patient it is what for a perfect of team to did. From my pop it of how. So while im on punishment I just waiting it out so my time will come because I can’t speed up there and just make it ??? quicker but it  I could  I would but  for now I have to want. Im a permanent for quite a while so I can just be patient .I know before taking it hard but most people have to do it because rushing is most likely not the way to do it patience also helps the maker  and cam saved you time. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can want for certainly things like; money, clothes, shoes, homes, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, car (transportation, and things of the sudn because at you post rush every thing you want get it the way you were surpose to but waiting and being patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be!

As I sit in the waiting room at @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 waiting and waiting for my grandpa to come to thee recovery room. I think to myself what if something went wrong or what if he doesn’t make it through the surgery. Then I say to my @CAPS3 “can we see grandpa now”, she said “@CAPS4 just be patient everything will be just fine if you sit relax and for hevan sakes,” “be patient!” “@CAPS5” I say to my @CAPS3. After an hour passed, I had gotten on say so I thought in my self and said to myself cahlem and patient, calm and patient. Then this lady come out to the waiting room and said “the surgery was a little longer than we expected but everything went perfectly fine but he will be staying in the hospital for a week an a half at the most “which was perfectly fine with me as long as I was get out of this boring hospital and as soon as I said I had my mom said as soon as grandpa gets to the recovery room we will go see him then we will leave!

A time when had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to @LOCATION2. From my house to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 it’s about @NUM1 hrs away. So I had to sit in a car for @NUM1 hours. The only things to do were listen to your ipod and sleep. Which I didn’t do either of those things. As you can tell it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for @NUM1 hours. After an hour had passed it would have felt like @NUM4 if you weren’t doing anything. By that time I was ready to mess with my sister who was sleeping. I knew I couldn’t do that though. Now was the time to think of something to do. I pulled out my phone and started texting people but no one answered. I tried looking out the window but that made me sleepy. Getting there took too long. Finally @NUM1 hours passed and we made it to @LOCATION2. This was a time when I had patience

I was off, I was off to the onto rama to be exact. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 got to see a whole bunch of cool old cars, @CAPS1 also got to see some old ones. Some cars were old and rusty and some are new and state of the art. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 saw a sign. It read come see chip foose! So @CAPS1 went and looked around." @CAPS1 found him! I exclaimed. "@CAPS2" @CAPS8 brother yelled." @CAPS3 is!" @CAPS4 @CAPS1 went and looked at the end of the line. It was @CAPS5! So @CAPS1 figured to would die down after a half an hour. @CAPS1 were very wrong. It was @CAPS5! The line @CAPS1 thought was big was nothing compared to the line now so @CAPS1 had to wait, and wait, and wait. @CAPS8 brother go to the point to where he could run a mile if he didn't he was going to explode. So I had to go walk around with him. I was relived because standing and doing nothing for @NUM1 hours gets boreing real fast. I was getting to the point where I had to get up and walk around or I was going to fun asleep. So I went for a walk with him. @CAPS1 got back and I sat back down @CAPS1 waited, and waited, and waited and waited. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 heard stop!" @CAPS6 body behind these people have to go and come back after the break." @CAPS7 the security guard. @CAPS1 were the last people. The people in front of us was a nerdy couple who had no life. @CAPS8 brother started to cry because he didn't get fooses autograph. The kind nerdy couple @CAPS7 "here have our spat @CAPS1 have all day and you @CAPS2 like you really wanted this autograph." @CAPS8 brother replied "sniff @CAPS9 won't it!!" @CAPS1 got it after 51/@NUM1 hours of waiting and waiting and waiting and dying.

Being patience is when someone could be bisy is just better to be patience while the other person is done. I am going to write about a time when someone I know was being patience. Well on one morning my mom had got out of work when she came I told my mum that I really wanned to go over my friends house. But my mom just keept on saying to wait and so I had to wait so I did? My mom wasn’t even done still so I told her if I could go working to my friends house. But she said no and that I had to be patience till she was done. My dad was living to his work in the afternoon so I had an idle. I told my dad if he could drop me off my friends house and then he could live to his work. So I did I went to tell him. But guess what he said no coz he was already late and I looked at the time and yhea he was already late so I dicided to just be patience coz my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving so I just sat down and watched tv while my mom was done. My mum had went insid the room and so I got up and asked if she was done and she said “yes” I so yelled so you are tackeing me and so she did I was so happy I rushed to the car and so we went and I went and my mom had left and that was the day I got to go to my friends house for just being patience.
<START>

I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it.

ON @DATE2 I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldn’t get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasn’t doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her I’m fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn’t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids but her self and @NUM2 of them is hises.  But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. But beening @CAPS1 I didn’t want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all here stuff she looked pretty everything went while but know on on we still cry in think about her. Then that was a time I didn’t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she’s in a better place with some of her love ones. But into this day I can’t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 forgotten.

The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs of kings that said “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1” and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead” and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said “@CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1”! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives!!! By: unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong

Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just can’t stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. I’m around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen.

Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don’t have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world don’t have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I don’t think if I didn’t have any patients I wouldn’t be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and don’t have and they get bad grades and everything.

In this narrative essay I will write about @NUM1 different times when I was out had to be patient. Such on the waiting to get out of school on a holiday. And when I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so I could get my game. Another thing I had to wait for was to get my final so as in the ??? all these times I had to be understanding. One day  I was very anxious to get out of school on a firday. And to make it I bad the clack was drare and I had  a planned schedule of my think day. When one thought passed by there like another set  in thinking for way I can stare at the abat and it would change. I was about to get a call home but the @CAPS1.A saved me. And I had to be understanding about that moment. Another time I had to be understanding about was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See what had happened was I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it. My mom was asleep it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before. And that was the time I had to be patient.

I’m currently writing my comic book, I havent begun drawin it yet. Here is a major scene in the @NUM1 book. “@CAPS1, @LOCATION1, are we there yet?” @CAPS2 asked with curiosity “@CAPS3. not yet” @PERSON1 replied with a sound of fear in her voice. They were lost, really lost. “Are we there yet?” little @CAPS2 asked again. “@CAPS3, @CAPS2, you’ll just have to be patient. “@ORGANIZATION1  said, becoming annoyed very quickly. So the walked for hours, but still @CAPS3 sign of the castle. Little @CAPS2 was egar to meet the queen, for she had imagined the queen as a kind, patient, beautiful woman. @ORGANIZATION1 could @CAPS9 that @CAPS2 was tired, lifting her on her shoulders she said t @CAPS2, “@CAPS9 if you can @CAPS9 the castle from here @CAPS2.” @CAPS11 a few long patient minutes, @CAPS2 finnly saw the castle “I @CAPS9 it, I @CAPS9 it!” she said with a smile. Jumping off of @ORGANIZATION1’s sholder, she bolted down the narrow path way. Because she had waited she was as excited as ever. Not only because she had found the castle but because she learned how to be patient.

A time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was so nervous, so it was hard to be patient.  I waited in the waiting  soon for about fifteen minutes, then the assistant called  me in. first  she told me what she going to do,  second she  took a x-ray of my teeth , third she put metal bonds with a really strong glue on the back of my teeth, fourth @PERSON1 put the brackets on with really strong glue. Then the assistant put the wire between the brackets and metal hands, finally, she asked me what color I wanted then she put them on and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit in a dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience it was hard but I did it. That is the time I had patience.

“so @CAPS1 do you want for your @DATE1?” “A @NUM1” “@CAPS1 else do you want?” A @NUM1” I have been wanting a play station @NUM3 for so long. It’s my thirteenth @DATE1 and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted one… I wanted one really dad. The only exception was that it cost @MONEY1 and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party, all together it would be a @MONEY3 @DATE1. So my mom and I decided on an agreement @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I don’t want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after @DATE1 then go buy my @NUM1! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. “hey mom when are we having the family party?” “@DATE2.” @CAPS2 that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it out @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. @CAPS3 waiting @NUM5 days isn’t patient then I dont know @CAPS1. From this day on I still havent gotten my @NUM1 but two days from now I’ll be holding a stack of  cash in my hands and heading to gamertop: @CAPS3 I had to wait any longer I probably wouldn’t have made it. Im not very patient.

A time I was patient was at my friend cousins birthday party. I was patient because the whole intire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friends parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple dinosaurs pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and icecream, decorated/painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, watch my friends cousin open his presents and much much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little map @CAPS1, it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, @CAPS1 OF @CAPS2 my friends mom said not to night because my friend has a volley ball game in the @TIME1. It felt like I waited for nothing. Then I realized when your patient you get what you want more often.
<START>

Being patient is important, as I’ve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldn’t get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1’s house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friend’s birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldn’t fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards.
<START>

Patience @CAPS1 is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient, if your not patient that means you are just about practicly mean because you are judging someone or makeing them do something really fast. For example if you are waiting inline for a ride at a comiville or something then if you are patient your being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying “hurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example. If you are a patient person people will probly like you. If you are impatient then you will probly have a hard time getting along with somebody.
<START>

There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the @CAPS1 test we had a very long time to the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldn’t go on to the next part. Also we couldn’t talk or get out of sets. I really wanted to go on t the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Every one in the class got done early to sense we couldn’t talk we just sat and weighed for testing time to be over I think every one wanted to go to the next part but we didn’t no body complained or said anything we had to do this for a few day every year. Every year I’m alway patient. That a story on when I’m patient.
<START>

@NUM1 Patience is when you understand and you don’t complain. A person who is patient is some     one who can wait and they don’t while every two second. A person like that can succeed in life. @NUM2 @CAPS1! @PERSON2 was getting was getting closer. First @PERSON6 then @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @PERSON7. She was coming town my row next. This was a night more. When is someone going pinch me go I wake up. @NUM3 “@PERSON5.” @PERSON3 and with a disappointed force “@CAPS2 did a poor set on this fest”. I think you should pet on. In my mind I was praying for her not to say the word, she responded, “@CAPS3.” When I got home my mom mad the letter and agreed with it. Why did I have to fall history. Next week the out or came. We sat down she was about to say something so I took a deep breath, you have to be patient and no complaining. I nodded my head with a smile so big with looked like my lips were about to fall off. @NUM4 A few weeks later. I got a little better every day. Her name was @PERSON4. She was very nice and thoughtful. She told me I was progressing by waiting and seeing the results. Finally the hundred points there came. I was nervous but confident at the same time. That test is going in wish it he met me! A week later @PERSON1 passed @PERSON6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 and @PERSON7. A smile on her face good job @PERSON5 you got an A-. It was hard in the begging but I was patient and I got a good grade. @NUM5 wait and don’t hag and see the results of the end. Patience helped me because I know in the future to be tolerant. A person who is patient is a person who accomplishes a goal.

A  time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister , my niece, and I were going to the barber shop at @NUM1. I was getting my hair cut by a official barbor. I waited all the way to @NUM2 to get my hair cut. That was a time I was patient
<START>

A time I was patient is now @DATE1. The reason is because I am waiting for @CAPS1 new phone. See in @DATE2, I spelled orange juices on @CAPS1 phone. Everybody would call me weired and responsible. At first @CAPS1 phone was fine and everything alright. Then one day @CAPS1 speaker stopped working. I could call anyone or  listen to music. @CAPS1 heart sank. I quickly ran to @CAPS1 dad and told him about @CAPS1 problem. He first lasted and shook his head. Then grabbed @CAPS1 phone to test it. After he disconnected it did not work, his face was shocked. He then asked me how did that happen. Now at the time I was so stunned,so i couldn’t figure it. Then the image of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something told me to keep this from @CAPS1 dad. I told anyway, and he laughed. I looked at him with a why are you laughing dad. He said “You are going to have to wait until I get the money.” @CAPS1 face was calm but here I am still waiting for the phone.

Every day I have to be patient, acctualy every one has to be patient. But have you ever been patient for a sibling? If so then you know how I felt when my sister didn’t want to go out side out of her own self wanting reasons.

One time when I was patient was when a new video game was coming  out. I asked my dad @CAPS1 we could pre-order it but he said no and that I would have to wait until @CAPS2. So I waited until @CAPS2 and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was then my birthday and I opened my last gift it was the video game! I was so excited I gave my parents @CAPS4 and & me my brother went to play it.

But you can’t so you get mad start to hit things and than you don’t get a good behaver. Then you make your parents made then they bring some of you gifts back to they store that is not patience. That is non patience when you get mad becomes   you can’t get what you want.

The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This important because it actuly makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patient. @CAPS5 were loading up for a three-hour drive to the @CAPS1 water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my unlce to see if @CAPS3 was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother @CAPS2 was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until @CAPS3 finaly couldn't take it anymore. "That's it!" @CAPS3 exclaimed, "I'm going in to get them!" @CAPS3 was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than @CAPS3 had. Which tells you a lot?Tyler comes out @NUM1 minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another @NUM2 minutes which my brother mad. "@CAPS4 took you so long?" @CAPS3 asked. "@CAPS5 had to make sure uncle @PERSON1 was ready to leave." my dad awnsered. As soon as @CAPS5 got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least @CAPS5 were all patient, except for my brother @CAPS3's still like that now.

Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I can’t tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didn’t mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether it’s a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around.

I was very patient last time I went to the doctors, @CAPS1 and my brother @CAPS2 had to wait outside in the waiting room until they called us in for our shots. Everybody else was getting to go a head of as and we stayed patient. It got really boring sitting in there but we stayed patient. After about two or three hours we were not as patient as we were a couple of hours ago. So we decide to go up and ask what was going on .We found out that we forgot to sign in and so once we did we got in.

Patience, if you are a patient person you are tolerant and understanding. There was a time I was very patient. "@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 go yet!? "@CAPS2," she replied, "@CAPS3 need to buy all of your school supplies." I always didn't like back to school shopping. That would mean going with @CAPS1 to a store for @NUM1 hours trying to find clothes, notebooks, pencils binders and pens. "@CAPS4 I really have to go too?" "@CAPS5 patient ok?" "@CAPS6, I replied. Every time I had to get clothes or pencils, I began to get more patient. Whenever I had to wait for @CAPS1. I just sat there, I just sat down and waited. And the day seemed to go by a lot faster @CAPS7 had been @NUM1 hours but @CAPS7 only felt like twenty minutes, when @CAPS3 left. I wouldn't wait till next year, I wanted to go shopping all over again!

Patience, having patience means you don’t complain about things that take long amounts of time. You are tolerant, or understanding. Some reasons why you should @CAPS7 patience are things like .  You @CAPS7 @CAPS8 wait in a extremely long line and the whole time you are waiting you say things like, “ @CAPS1, this takes @CAPS5.” Or, “ @CAPS1, when @CAPS3 @CAPS6 leave.” @CAPS3’t @CAPS6 just @CAPS9?” Your @CAPS1 would be thinking, “ @CAPS4 my gosh would you just stop talking?” Or she would just want @CAPS8 scream. So your @CAPS1 probably wouldn’t ever want @CAPS8 take you somewhere that involved waiting ever again because she knows that you are @CAPS8 impatient @CAPS8 handle it. Some reasons why maybe you wouldn’t want @CAPS8 be patient or you would wan’t @CAPS8 be inpatient could be like if you had a meeting with your teacher and if you were late then you would @CAPS7 a bad first impression.So your @CAPS1 is taking @CAPS5 talking on the phone so you keep saying,’’@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9,@CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9!” @CAPS10 you wait very impatiently. Although, patience is basically like a kind , gentle way of waiting. Even though on the inside, your picturing yourself screaming at someone who you’re waiting on. Where on the outside, you are patiently waiting. So, having patience is a good thing. Try, it sometimes just don’t let your feelings on the inside tear apart what is happening on the outside.

Patience is when you are waiting on something. When you rush that’s not being patient. When you are being patient you don’t rush. @CAPS1’s another meaning of patience to when you stay calm that’s being patience staying from getting angry. Some people say they are losing @CAPS1 patience that means that @CAPS1 about to get angry. Those the meaning of patience @CAPS1 was a time I was being patience.  I wait for @CAPS2 to come.i wait, I wait, I wait I didn’t rush they say @CAPS2 is @CAPS4’s birthday. In the bible it say be patient and I did.

Being patient is a valve. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient.

This week I have been very patient. I really wanted a wii and no one would buy me one. So I saved up my money for so long. Then I had to wait what felt like weeks was @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days. That just made it feel longer. So I desided to tell my self I didn’t want it so I wasn’t anxious to get it. That kind of worked. But when I got it to tell you the truth it isn’t as fun as I thought it would be.
<START>

In my opinion, I am a very inpatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something , they’d better stop it on the spot or @PERSON1 I rate, child makes a huge breakthrough, also, I am not one of those kids who waits for dinner, I snack my way to it! and when I am at school, I just @CAPS1 listening to meap instructions for hours on end. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy.! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage! Overall I think people need more patience these days.

Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack. One person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been very patient for the past couple years. He did not try to make his team be better than they were he just had them try their @CAPS2 and see what the end result was. The @ORGANIZATION4 ended up going @NUM1 that year and by getting the second worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3 they got the second pick in the twenty tend @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft the @ORGANIZATION4 took @ORGANIZATION5 an defensive lineman out of the @ORGANIZATION2. He is an outstanding player and the @ORGANIZATION4 other pick was a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 out of the @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1's team is so good this year because of @PERSON1's patience with his team and his understanding of his player's talents.

Who likes being patient it’s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they’re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it just be patient and it will pay off.

A time that I showed patience is when my sister broke my futon. It was the day that I had gotten it and I was in the living room watching a movie when all of a suddent I heard "@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!" I ran upstairs to find out what happend and I saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost.  I showed patience by not yelling at them. I soon got another futon that isn't broken and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break! And that is my story on how I showed patience once!

One night, when me, @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister, @PERSON1, were asleep. Our parents were on the computer. @CAPS4 usually don't stay up that late. So I just thought @CAPS2 was doing something for work. In the @TIME1, when we wake up, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen with smiles on their faces. @CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. "I wonder @CAPS3 it could be…." I thought. I asked @CAPS9 mom "@CAPS3's going on!?!" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowely brought up a document from behind his back presenting it to us. The heading on the document said "@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8." @CAPS9 parents were smirking @CAPS11 @CAPS9 sister and I stared at each other in amazement. @CAPS11 if we were reading each other's mind, we both well knew that we were going on a cruise! I grinned excitedly and looked at the @CAPS15 on the paper. "@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2.'' it said. Today was @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2 "That's like, two months away!!!."  "@CAPS10," @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, "you must be patient." @CAPS11 normal kids did. I said "@CAPS12…" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 knew @CAPS9 disappointment and said "@CAPS14 things come to those who wait. I nodded contently. I knew that I was going to have to rough the two months out and be patient. The first couple weeks felt like mont's to us. We were oh so anxious @CAPS11 you would guess. But, @CAPS11 time progressed the patient got easier. I was able to focus on other things beside the cruise. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, the time come for us to head on a plane for the cruise." That quick! It went by that quick! I m so excited, @CAPS2! I said when we were boarding the plane. "I'm proud of you, son. You we're patient!" That's the time of how I learned to be patient! @CAPS11 @CAPS9 @CAPS2 says, "@CAPS14 things will come to those who wait."

I’m going to tell you a time when I was patient. a time I was patient was when I had to save up my money to get the new game halo reach. I had to pre order it with my money, so I did a bunch of work so I cut the lawn at my house then I cut other peoples lawn for two dollars so I did that for about two months at the end. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks so I did just that. I waited and bought some other stuff with the left over money and the game finaly came in the mail. that’s a time I use patients to wait for something.

Once there was a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient. One day @PERSON1 was going to get her drivers licence. She was to and was so excited to be able to drive. When @PERSON1 got to the licence place she saw that there were a lot of  people waiting. She estimated about @NUM1 people were there, “@CAPS1 did there have to be so many people here,”she thought to herself. After about @NUM2 minutes of waiting she got @CAPS6 mad, because only one person got his licence in the time period. She thragh a big fit  right there. “ugghh! I was supposed to get my licence today not wait around for a bunch of experienced adults to get their licence renewed!” she started blabbering and said. “@CAPS1 do you guys take so long! You are so slow!” she went home and started talking to her faend @CAPS3 on the cell phone. “@CAPS2 there were many people I am never going to get my licence @CAPS3!”   “@PERSON1 just calm down. Stop being so impatient.”  “@CAPS4 the line was so long and . ’ @PERSON2 cut @PERSON1 off. “@CAPS5 you keep running home crying, you will never got your license. The line for a driver licence is always that long. I had to wait @NUM2 hours to get mine.“@CAPS6 five hours!”“@CAPS7, @CAPS4 I took @NUM4 hours with me so I wouldn’t be bored. Take your phone with you. “@CAPS8, ’’ @PERSON1 replied.The next day she went back to the licence place, she took her phone and a book with her. While she waited, she texted her friend, went online and read her book for her book project. She kept moving in the line @CAPS4 she didn’t even realize @CAPS11. @PERSON1 waited for @NUM5 hours that day @CAPS4 she only thought @CAPS11 was @NUM4 because she was preoccupied. @PERSON1 felt great when she finally got her licence, she was the second one in school in got her licence (after @PERSON2).“@CAPS9 @PERSON2, you taught me how to be patient and calm down.”“@CAPS10 problem, @CAPS11’s the least I could do for my best friend.”

Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. One time when I was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half day at school. One day in elementary school we had a half day which parents didn’t know about. After school I waited in the parking lot for close to @NUM1 minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. I was starting to think my parents weren’t coming until a teacher asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation the teacher let me call my parents. My dad had a appogized and went to get me after I explained then I could finally go home.

I’ve been patent plenty of times but when I ordered a new game console that is when I had to be patient. My dad and I were getting a game console that would be at our porch in two weeks. For me it felt like a life time, but I had to keep patient. Not for those fourteen days did I complain, niether did my dad. when it came, it was definitely worth the wait. That is a time when it was necessary to have patience and to not complain.

Have you ever had enough patients to deal with @NUM1 screaming  kids. I,can proudly say that i can. It all started when my uncle steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed alot of help so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem was there where @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But,it didnt take long  for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. So all of the @NUM1 kids start fighting. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was atleast a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn’@CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @NUM1 hours I’d had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about @NUM7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patients I had. After that I dont think that I want to go on a roadtrip again.

Patience is a  feeling that you get when you experience  are difficult task and do your best to  overcome it without  complaining about the task, like when your getting paint out and then  you  squeeze  it and it won’t come out, but you still keep trying until you figure out that  it is gone.  Then you go get a new bottle to start using. I wish that more people were patient, then we wouldn’t gave to listens to constant complaining.

Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. One time I remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to @CAPS1 point. When we went to @CAPS1 point we all were ready to ride the magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop –the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not complain. Although, not being able to sit down after a while gets kind of painful but I still never complained. A little while later I actually started forgetting I was in line because the people started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how good every thing worked out intil we got to the bumper cars.

Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait. @CAPS1’s a good one to have too, @CAPS1 can help you in a lot of situations. If gas have patience, you wont get nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend @PERSON1 was getting me. I didn’t think about @CAPS1 that much so @CAPS1 didn’t really get to me. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be really cool, which made being patient a little bit harder. I was still able to keep @CAPS1 off my mind. I had to make sure I didn’t think about @CAPS1, so I wouldn’t beg my friend to know what @CAPS1 was, because that would be impatient. If your impatient people might get annoyed because you will always ask questions, and got on there nerves. @CAPS1’s good to be patient with friendhips, so you dont become mean to them or anyone else. @CAPS1’s @CAPS2 not good to be impatient with your family. If your patient you can work things out better, and stay more on task and focused.

Here’s a story about time when I was patient. So the story begins at art prize and loved to see the beautiful art there, but I was dieing to see the winnig picture for art prize. My parent told me to wait until we all see the rest of the art prize amazing art. So I signed and replyed ok we can see the rest of the art prize things first.  While we were looking at the art the whole time I was thinking about the winning piece. That is all I thought about. ??? A little bit later. I was thinking of what a blessing it is to be here at art prize. So I checied up and disieded patience is good. And if you wait for something for a while it all of a sodden it seems more valuable.  A couple hours later I started to head to the car, and my mom intrupted and said, “@CAPS1 don’t you want to see the winning piece of art?” “@CAPS2 yes I forget.”@CAPS3 there is not a line now so when we go to see it there was no line. I was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of sergeants drawn out of just a pencil. That day I learned that patient is important, because that way it was worth the wait to see something that you like.

She said, “I don’t know.” And walked away. About a hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied “finally!” @CAPS4 I had to go pack. @CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, “@CAPS5! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave!” @CAPS6 I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS7 house she opened the door and let me in. I said, “@CAPS8 it took @CAPS6 long. Thanks for being @CAPS6 patient!”

Yo! I’m the narrator… you know the dude that tells the story, well I’m gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 being the smart @CAPS1 he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!

Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. Many people can’t be patient. For example my brother. If he orders something online or is wait for dinner be perparred he always has to be winey of when he’s going to get what he wants. I’m not like that. I actully have patience. For example I needed shoes so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was searching on the @ORGANIZATION1 store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day my mom orders them online, I was so excited, I waited and waited. After three day I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldn’t drop me off. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad was comeing home that exact day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning. My mom came home and saw a box laying on the front. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! I went to go welcome her and I saw my shoes lay there. I jumped up in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. My mom came in the room and said they were suppose to arrive on @DATE1 but since you were patient they came early.

Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the ??? I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the ??? as I searched @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up @CAPS1 magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did @NUM2 minutes ago,” @CAPS2 how much longer?” The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, “not much longer now dear.” @CAPS3, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but can’t help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as @CAPS5 texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock @CAPS5 scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope.” @PERSON1  the doctor is ready to see you now.” @CAPS4, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. “You know it’s funny,” @CAPS5 says well snapping her gum. “@CAPS6 someone.

Patience is when you get in a long line at the grocery store when you are waiting for a new video game. That happened to me when I was on the great jorney to california.

To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousin’s house to watch her daughter @CAPS1’ @PERSON1 , for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldn’t wait.When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldn’t hush. Tthen I said, “ @NUM1 , what’s the matter ?” @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because  I stayed somewhat calm and I didn’t complain to @CAPS1’@CAPS4’s mom.

Every year since I learned a bout @LOCATION1 and presents, now that I think about they never said you’d have to wait months until @CAPS1 came around. I love @CAPS1 but once a year or so @CAPS2 patient enough to wait until @DATE1 downward. The first @DATE2 of @DATE1 told me @CAPS1 was coming along with all we decorating ,carolling  and wistfull of @CAPS1 joy. I usually try to pass the time by having snow ball wars with my cousins. I still feel temptation trying to rush time and make me anxious and grueling to wait so long but @CAPS2 still patient and try to let the temptation go away. When @CAPS1 eve came I feel greatful I made it this long with patients because @CAPS2 just like my parents and cant wait for anything that takes month. Then it comes around as slow as possible and then leave quicker, then I could think how fast it left. Just like the saying time file sometime  having fan.

Now I can write you a whole entire book about the @CAPS1. So I saw a @CAPS1 had set on t.v. so I asked my mom could she buy it. And she said when I get the money, but until then no. so of course I was upset. So I was waiting counting until the days went buy. Then final that very @CAPS12 came, and you know what that means. “@CAPS11 @CAPS12” the @CAPS12 has arrived the @CAPS12 I get my toy but I didn`t know that she only got two hundred dollars so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up steair and locked my door and cryed myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the @CAPS12 and when my birthday was here can guess what…? I finally got the best of all. The @CAPS4 and my mom said that all that patients you did got what you wanted.

Patient is like your waiting for something and you don't complain its taking to long, and your just sitting there waiting quietly. Here is an example. One time I was waiting to go get a check up at the docters and your sitting there quiet reading a magazine and just sitting there. Theres an example on being patient

I have been patient lots of times in my life but this time was really hard to be patient because I was so exited about building. Left in my reach we had been planting it for a while now and we started on a @DATE1 after school was over we got like half of it done that day but there we couldn’t work on it again for a week because my brother, sister, dad, and mom all had ?? or ?? so I had to wait a week  just to work on it again. It was really hard to be patient this time thogh because I had been waiting to do this for a while. After a week finally passed, it seemed like a month but now I could finish my work and I was so exited. A few days later we finally finished the walls painted a blue and gold for u of @CAPS1 and my left as all we had to do was put my dad in my left then it was ready to sleep in.

One time when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I had to wate about @NUM1 hours to go on the top thrill dragster. I was so patient because it was my first time ever going on the dragster. Me and my dad were wating and wating. When we got to the front of the line I was so scared that I was going to pee my pants. When we got on the rollercoaster I said that I don’t want to go. So my dad asked if my son could get off the rollercoaster and they said when you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it and when I did I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was a @NUM2 second ride it was the best thing that I had ever wated for in my life so far. That is the time when I had to be patient to get something that I really wanted.

My friend was waiting for @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad, my dad was busy fixing his @CAPS1. He was waiting, waiting, and waiting till he fixed it. I was wondering what the question was.

Being patience is a good thing because if you are and then you are in some rough time in life. Patience people can do by bringing something to do. They could what there for three hours and not be herd. There are some people that can’t what there for three hours. There are some people that can’t what there for ten minets. These people get made at that and they will just give up. But after all of those people that can and can’t people cant quit. People what there for one hour and will blow up. And then there are people that can’t do it but they do. So all you have to do is find anything to do if you can’t do it.

“@CAPS1 are we there yet?” I keep asking over and over again. “@CAPS2 but almost,” he replied. Today we are going to @LOCATION1 adventures and I am so excited! After I asked my @CAPS1 when we would be there, about @NUM1 minutes later we finally arrived at @LOCATION1 adventures! The line  to get are tickets was long but not to long. Once we get them we went to go look for a lock to put all of are stuff in! The line far that wasn’t long so we did that fast! We were now all hungry, so we went to go eat! The time we got into the restaurant, the lines to order were very long! Ok, so now that we are all done eating, it was time to ride some awesome e rides! “@CAPS3, man!” is what I would get saying when the lines to the rides were super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, ok say I had to go change my clothes to go into the water park and change back or go to the restroom man these lines were super long too! Now that the day is almost done, and the park will be closing, my family and I arent into the gift shop: we were in the for about @NUM1 minutes waking around. When we were done and we were ready to check out, the check out line wasn’t long at all! Finally, there was a line that wasn’t long! All that day I was a very patient girl!

A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at @ORGANIZATION1 vaction. I was having a blast. My family didn’t come because they don’t like roller coasters. We dicided to ride the @CAPS1, it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the @CAPS1. We really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth waiting @NUM1 and a half hours @ORGANIZATION1 it and we even went on it twice.

Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well being patient is something you need in life. I’m going to tell you a little bit about being patient. (@NUM1) patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need for when we go shoping, or when your in the car. You must be patient when you are in the car because if you don’t then you could get into an accident. Patience has many qualities. If you aren’t patient when you are place then you are going to become annoying. When their are long lines or something and your not patient people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you. (@NUM2) being patient is important. If you have kids your impatient, then your going to teach your kids to be impatient. That’s not a good thing. As you can see I have told you as much as I can about patience.

A time when @CAPS3 parants were’s  patient was when I wouldn’t @CAPS7 @CAPS3 dinner. One night @CAPS3 dad made chop soey for dinner. I didn’t like chop soey at @CAPS1! The smell of it @CAPS2 made me gag! But, @CAPS3 dad loves chop soey  so he makes it @CAPS1 the time! We @CAPS1 sat down to @CAPS7. I ate a potato and @CAPS3 dad gave me whole scoop of chop soey. “I’m not gonna @CAPS7 it.” I said. “I hate chop soey.” @CAPS3 dad sat patiently at the table waiting for me to @CAPS7 what was on @CAPS3 plate. “fine,” I said, “ I’@CAPS4 @CAPS7 the meat out of it.” I took the fork and stired the chop soey around looking for the meat. After I ate @CAPS1 the meat. I said “@CAPS5 I am done.” @CAPS3 dad laughed at @CAPS3 stubbornness. “@CAPS7 the vegetables out of it.” @CAPS3 dad said. “@CAPS9 @CAPS10! I hate celery!” I whinned. After a half  hour of the war of wills @CAPS3 dad won. I @CAPS2 wanted to leave the table but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating the chop soey and leaving the table. That was when @CAPS3 dad was very patient.

??? One time when I was being very patient was when I was with my grandparents. We were suppose to be going to @CAPS1 adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldn’t get there that late. So the next day we get to her house right there at @NUM1 like she said and we had found out that she had over slept and we all looked at one another because we new that it was going to take a long time. So I said that’s ok we can wait and we all went into her house and waited until every one was ready.

One time I had to be patient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my mom, dad, @CAPS1 my sister and my grandma. My cousins live in @LOCATION1 so we were going to visit them. We had to drive @NUM1 hours in a small col bolt with five people. We had to be patient on the car ride there because we were all really exited.

Then we had to drive till about @TIME1 and we were fanaly @TIME1 my great aunts lake house, my my grandmas sister. It was so fun geting to see them again! But then came more patients on the trip home. We were all sad to leave but we had a great time. The trip home felt shorter than the trip there but still long. When we got home everyone of us was tired and tired of being in the car but we were glad we didn’t have to drive anothe hour home like my grandma. That was a time when I had to be patient.

What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tryed everything for four years, begging, pleading, even cleaning, but it still didn’t work. My mom says I have to be @NUM1 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until soccer is finished and find a place and she’ll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place.

Sometimes being patient is hard @CAPS5 I’ve had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I’ve always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see @CAPS3 my presents @CAPS5 their were none. My mom was just watching @CAPS1.V. like nothing was important and I said to her, “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 she said back was “@CAPS2, why are you up this early?” I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, @CAPS5 nothing. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until @NUM1, just waiting for someone to say “happy birthday” @CAPS5 yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until @NUM2: pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient I got a good party and now I’m patient every day.

Last @DATE1 I went with some friends to the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 is about christan rock music. The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite christan rock band, @CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their cd's and it was amazing. The past that made me patient was the line that my friend @PERSON1 and I had to wait in to get autographs. It almost streched out the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end of it. Even though the wait was long the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front the wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice and I gave there lead singer @CAPS3 my lucky braclet. That was the time I was patient.

One time there were two twin chipmunks, there names were @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 always had patience A.J not so much. One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed up there camping gear and headed farther into the woods it was around dusk when they reached were they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire, @LOCATION1 started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how there mom and dad had taught them. As l said in the first part @LOCATION1 has no patience so he kept on trying but after awile he stopped he would hit the rocks together once and it wouldn’t start so @PERSON1 tried in @NUM1 minute he got it started. A.J. didn’t care he got the acorns and started cookin. But every time he’d only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds so he tried and tried finally he just stopped well it @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes, @LOCATION1 was really mad now so they went to bed. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning he found @LOCATION1 cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient.

My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled.  I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums.  Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left.  The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience.

One day I was being really patient. I was baby sitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or you’ll go to your room. So he stoped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home now that a whole different story. So thats the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters.

A time when I was very patient was last year. My auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game. So the next day she when I woke up I woke up to early.

I wanted to call her back and ask her questions like where are you goin and how long your gonna be gone. but I was trying to be patient. Now at @NUM4 my mom said lets go! Now I was really getting mad because I was not expecting to leave with my mom. So me and my mom got home at around @NUM5 pm. Now I was real angry because she had not even called since we was gone. So I called her and she said she comin down the street. I was so happy so later on that day I had fun with my couisins and aunt.

“@CAPS1,when @CAPS5 we open presents?” I asked. “@CAPS2 we get back from church” she replied. It was our typical @DATE1 schedual, make @CAPS3 eve dinner all day, go to the @CAPS3 eve service , have grand parents for dinner than all the kids get to open one present than go to bed for about one hour get up , and open more presents.  Amen,” our pastor concluded the service “@CAPS5 we go now, @CAPS1?” I blubbered “@CAPS6” she said.@CAPS8 we ate dinner I felt like I had ants in my pants, I was so excited. time seemed to go by so slow I was @NUM1 years old before my grand parents left. Finally we were all gathered around the @CAPS3 tree @CAPS8 I was about to open my present. All it was was a sleeping bag than my dad said,” you @CAPS5 all sleep on the floor in @LOCATION1 room, but be sure you go to bed.” @CAPS8 I was laying on the floor, while my sister was sound asleep, I was thinking, I wonder what I‘ll get for @CAPS3. I eventually fell asleep. The next morning at @NUM2. I jumped out of bed woke my sister up and ran into my parents room to wake them up. I was thinking finally we get to open presents. That was a time where I had to be very patient. But it was all paid off in the end.

Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.

One day I asked my parents if I could buy this game that I wanted and this game that I wanted and they asked me how much is it? I said that I did not know how much it is. So he said that we would go to the store and see how much it is. When we got to there we found out that it was @MONEY2 and I said can I buy it and he said maybe after a while I started begging he still said @CAPS1! when I went home I went to sleep the next morning I was at home watching @CAPS2.V and I saw this commercially about the game and it said that the game was still @MONEY1 so I ???. When we went to the mall me saw that it was @MONEY3 and so I finally got to buy it.

Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was every patient one day when I was ten year old. It was all because of popcorn. A small little popcorn cernal cought in my throught .That was an aginizing day, but I was very patient. One day, about two year ago when I was ten years old swallowed a popcorn cernal after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box then trowing the box away. Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy.

There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the I can remember the most was when I was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal, for our flight to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2’d been waiting about @NUM1 minutes when @CAPS2 heard an announcement. “@CAPS1 has gone wrong with the plane but @CAPS5 should be fixed in about an hour.” @CAPS2 eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But @CAPS6 there was another announcement “I’m sorry, but @CAPS2 cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours.” @CAPS3 sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed. @CAPS6 four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power so I was just fiddling with my fingers. @CAPS6 @CAPS2 heard “@CAPS5 turns out @CAPS2 cannot get the part until tomorrow morning.” @CAPS6 a big “ughhh” swept accrcoss the terminal. But luckily, @CAPS2 received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but @CAPS2 all had patience, so @CAPS2 got through @CAPS5.

A couple of days ago when I was at cheer a lot of drama was going around our team, it was fifteen days befor compition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom cutine in our second formation wasnt in a diagnal line we were supposed to be and wasnt getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1(one of our coaches daughters) was yelling at the side I’m on for not getting to the kickline in time even though shes the on pushing us father down so we cant get there then she started yelling at @PERSON1 saying it was all her falt so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, “@LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone else for everything you arnt perfect at everything ether, and your  the ones pushing us over so we cant get to the kickline in time.” @LOCATION1 didnt know what to say but she said “@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! that isnt true.” even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline she didn’t move closer to the center she moved farther and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends, they still are friends, just not best friends.

A time when I was patient was when I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go but she wasn’t ready. She had to get her hair done and some clothes on. I waited patiently and didn’t say nothing. I didn’t want to but I did. I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go so I waited on her. I walked out the door quietly then my sister yelled I want to go wait. I went back in the house and waited for her to first find some clothes, so she went upstairs and found some. She put her clothes on then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then found them in the corner. So we were about to walk out and I said girl what’s wrong with your har suprised. She felt her head and said o I forgot. So we went back in the house and I tried to put her hair in a ponytail and it wouldn’t fit. So I let her do something and she couldn’t. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we went outside. That’s a time when I waited paintently on my sister.

When I was getting ready to leave my uncles ranch. I was waiting patiently for my dad to get back so he could help my brother put the @NUM1 on to the tryler. It has been @NUM2 hours and my dad has not come back yet. I was having a difficult time taking my @NUM3 off the tryler because it was to heavy and my dad was still riding his @NUM3. When my dad got back my brother went to go ride his @NUM3. I was having a very difficult time trying to get everything and leave but finally my mom and sister wanted to leave to so they finally helped me.
<START>

It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. So we sat around till all of they were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said “why did you get of line?” “I am scaryed.” “ I want to go on it though.” “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 said” @CAPS1 we go on the ride?” “@CAPS2 we @CAPS1” my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when @CAPS4 said “I @CAPS1 wait.” “@CAPS3 lets get it over with.” @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now.

Have you ever been patient before? Well l have l was sitting there in a nice warm and cozy seat exhausted dozing off waiting for them to say the came @PERSON1. It kept going throught my mind @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, but nothing ever happened so l just sat there waiting patiently. My mom was sitting next to me reading an avon magazine that she had picked up from the small, round wooden table centered right in the middle of the silence orthodonist office. I kept asking myself things like I wonder what their gonna do today, I wonder if I'll get my expander off or what about my top braces. Then l starting to stare at the office ladies typing away on their computers. The sound of metal tools was ringing in my ear, coming from the back room. A girl walked out "@CAPS1" l was excited and nervous at the same time but l was proud because l had sat there the whole time patiently.

‘Patience’  @CAPS1 were on are way the the big city, to go to a very specil baseball game. Can you guess what I game? It’s the “@LOCATION1 tigers,” @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 stadium, “@CAPS1 were so excited, it was the first time @CAPS1 had ever been in @LOCATION1. “@CAPS5 much longer till @CAPS1 get there?” I asked. “About @NUM1 hour, why? my mom replayed  “because its so boring siting here for four hours strait.” “I know, but you have to be patient.” “@CAPS6.” I thought in my bad. “I wounder @CAPS5 I could be patient for? I just though for a moment. Then a minite, then boom! I was out cold: for two hours I slep. Then I woke up just as @CAPS1 hit trafic. I asked “are @CAPS1 there yet”, “hope” my dad said. So I sat there waiting pacently. About @NUM2 min later I asked can @CAPS1 turn an the radio. “@CAPS7” my mom said. @CAPS1 sat there for about @NUM3 in. Then @CAPS1 finaly sarted moving handest not to be anoing, what I was going to do when I got to game. I was thinking mabey I’ll get a bit exspenedve, bur by the time I thought anything else I hurd “were here!” “@CAPS7!” I skeamed. So @CAPS1 got out of the and walked about a @NUM4 of a mile to the ticket booth. As @CAPS1 were walking up I though “I guess all it does take is patience.
<START>

Two week sago meandmy family went to siyflags, for fright fest. The lines were going to be long and I would nevero be patient, I hate being patient . We went on @LOCATION1 city @CAPS1 first the lines was only ten minutes. Then the super man, that one was a little longer. Me and my sister got permission to leave and go on the riper. Then perisa wooden rollercoaster that goes of the track a lot we waited @NUM1 minutes between each stop. We finally got to where we sun the coster people with these flash passes kept coming. The flash pass takes you to the front of the line. When we fin ally got to the front of the line my patients was @CAPS2. The roller coster went off the track. It was a @NUM2 mile coster but a tur one. That is the time I was  patient.
<START>

One day, last year I had to be really patient my mom had told the family that we would be going to six flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldn’t wait so I asked her when and she said she didn’t know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a @DATE1 because she works during the week I was just happy that school was finally out so I didn’t have to worry about home-work. So I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldn’t randomly go one @DATE1. That @DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure. She didn’t have any meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free @DATE1 she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because that’s better than nothing .Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for six flags. When the two weeks were finally over I had about @MONEY1 saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been.

Patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outdoor mail with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After ward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home!
<START>

One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & I taught him how to pitch. @PERSON1 easly devoloped a nice windup and delivery but the arin angle was off. But this didn’t stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said “no!” @CAPS2 time went on @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing @NUM1 mph fasiball at a cetcher. On day’s that he’s unaccurate he doesn’t gave he keeps trying and doesn’t wine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to some seltons patience.

“@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon don’t worry,” @CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaing. Well over these few days (which feels like cons) I have not been this so called “@CAPS3” person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didn’t come in the mail. I’ve been waiting and waiting but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fith time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didn’t. “I’ve been sitting here since ten o’clock where is the @CAPS4 track!” I scream. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! “@CAPS5 coming” I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white @CAPS6-@CAPS7  truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 that’s it!) @CAPS9 to gaze. Nope it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps.” @CAPS10!” I sob in agony, “ why does this feeling consume me like this?” I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. “ @CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here!” I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally!
<START>

One of the many times I was patience was when my @CAPS1, my @CAPS2 and I went to a restrant. We oderd our food and found a tabil. We were siting there waiting  for the food. I ask my @CAPS1 "@CAPS3 much longer its going to take?" @CAPS4 said "you have to be pactien and waitie". And then a little after the our food was done. It was toatlly worth it.
<START>

About three or four times I was patience; it was when I was five and it was my birthday and my grandmother when shopping for me I had to be patience and wait for her to come back with my presents. The other time was when I was @NUM1 and it was @CAPS1 day and I was up super early and ready to be to patience, once again and wait for my dad to wake up so I can open my presents. Then the  other time was when my friend had to do something so I had to be patince again so ,I waited till he got back. This will conclude my being patince paper .
<START>

The time I was patient was when @CAPS4 went to @LOCATION1 "mom!" I exclaimed. "@CAPS1's go I want to leave I'm packed and ready to go." @CAPS2 mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beutiful @DATE1 in @LOCATION2 and it was also @CAPS2 step dad's birthday. "@CAPS3 you need to be patient okay, @CAPS4 have a long drive, do you have everything you need." @CAPS5 got me there. I had to get, coloring materials, the portable @CAPS6 player, ect…. I had @CAPS7 @CAPS8 what else @CAPS4 needed until @CAPS2 stomach growled it sounded like a bear protecting it's cubs, fierce, and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in @CAPS2 head, food thats what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips. Saltandvinager, sour crean and onion (caross) and jolepenyo ceddar(yum). Now I have everything I thought, "of @CAPS4 go." @CAPS9 @CAPS2 mom and again I rushed out the door "got the address," asked @CAPS2 father." @CAPS10 @CAPS3 I got it." @CAPS11 when @CAPS4 started to go @CAPS2 sister fell asleep. @CAPS5 was sleeping lik arock the whole way there although, I don't think rocks shore. after @NUM1 hours of being awake in the car I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitment was rushing so fast I could feel it then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way but I was marked impossible. Finally @CAPS2 step father yelled "wake up!!" I was so tierd when I woke up, " are @CAPS4 there yet, first thing that came out of @CAPS2 mouth "yeah" and, of course, the first things I did was jump up and out of the care! "@CAPS12!" @CAPS2 mother shouted. I paused as if I was a charactor in a video game and the player press pause." @CAPS13 take in some off the bags." "@CAPS14" I said with a scowse on @CAPS2 face. "@CAPS15 youhave to be patient" as I took in the bag there it was to condo of @CAPS2 dreams and the first thing I did was sleep.
<START>

Being patient isn’t always that easy, in fact, last year was one year where I had to sit in a car with @NUM1 rude, screaming and crying kids for @NUM2 hours. Last year I was so excited to see my great @CAPS3 davn in???. with my grandpa. My @CAPS1 pa is fan bag to talk to, @CAPS2 later than I found out my @NUM1 younger cousins were coming. This was going to be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my ipod and a book, @CAPS2 my cousins brought??? loud noisy and flossy toys they bot just for the ride. As we started heading for @LOCATION1 I turned my ipod on and found out it only had @PERCENT1 battery left. Half way there I was almost dad of borden, @CAPS2 the kids were just settling down. When I was sure they were asleep I decided to join them. WACK! I auske is a sobbery slap to the face, “were here” my cousin enchoired, finally I said to myself as I was still waking up with a sore, and stiff neck. After we were done visiting my @CAPS3, it was about @NUM4 hrs and my cousins were all asleep again and I knew it was going to be a nice ride home.
<START>

There was a day when I was patient and I was so nice and this girls was so in aher she was getting on my nrvise because she push me and hitting me. So I just let her in front of me and we where in @CAPS1 and lot of people be ready for @CAPS1 lady said stop push her. Then we where in class and so I rise my hand and she said be patient I said I am patient so shut up so shut up please so she don’t shut up so I my had a other time and the teacher call on me so she got mad at me.
<START>

I am going to write about the time that I was patient. One day, after my family and I came back from church, I asked my room I she could make breakfast, but she would not answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma and my grandma talks a lot. It was so oganizing. For example, I kept paceing back and forth but then I just sat down. After an hour of patientience, my mom and grandma said goodbye and hung up the phone and I finally got my breakfast.
<START>

One some day, it was about @NUM1. My mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready I don’t know what we was getting ready far, but we get on the road as soon as we cloud. I fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the height. I woke up from a big @CAPS1 on the breaks and when I looked up, we were in a long line of cars,” where are we?”I ask “six flags.” @CAPS2 my brother. I could hear impatience people all around me. They were thinking screaming and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park. It seem like we were moving faster than @CAPS3 of the fast people, and we was one of the first people to get in first. That was the @CAPS3 impatience group of people I’d ever seen.
<START>

Pg @NUM1: @CAPS1 her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were @NUM2 of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! So we couldnt even more our arms I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was @NUM3 oclock in the morning and I saw a big sign that read welcome to @CAPS2. So at that point we only had a hour or so left I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination key wrap. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tryed my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didnt are and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @NUM4°@CAPS3 degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didnt even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But how I know I have the patients to go home!
<START>

A time when I was patient was just yesterday. I had just finished part @NUM1 of the rest and I was very anxious and I wanted to get up and more around, but were taking the @CAPS1 so I could not. Instead I entertaind myself in any way I could such as pretend singer writing running songs through my head repeatedly, even twiddling my thumbs! So finally she let us get and talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends so I just talked to them. Somehow we got into talking about dangeons and dragons, they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. anyway I kept trying too talk but I keep geting interupted so I just relaxed and waited for my turn. Finnaly it was my turn to talk, but we had to go to lunch so I never did get to say what mine was.This is a time when I was patient.
<START>

Have you ever got annoid because someone kept saying be patient? I have and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about the time I was patient. One time I was on my way to @LOCATION1, the plane ride wasn’t as bad as what @CAPS1 gonna tell you. When @CAPS3 got to @PERSON1 @CAPS3 had to pass through @PERSON1@NUM1 border it was hot!!! I think tempeture hit @NUM2? @CAPS3 had to wait in this small room with about @NUM3 people, and they had no A. C. All of us were waiting for the bus to come, and after @NUM4 hours a bus arrived. @CAPS3 were getting on as about @NUM5 people came barging in front, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 miss that bus. Then @CAPS3 waited again for a bus the after @NUM6 hours a bus arrives agains @CAPS2 were trying get on then again @CAPS3 get pushed out of the way. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 missed that bus I was @CAPS2 fustrated @CAPS2 did my family. Another thing I got frustrated at was there were thousand’s of flys all over the place. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 waited after @NUM4 more hours a bus arrives but my little brother was in the bathroom @CAPS2 @CAPS3 missed that bus @CAPS2 my mom was telling me to calm down and be patient @CAPS2 I stayed patient until the @NUM8 th bus came, @CAPS3 got on but the bus didn’t go where @CAPS3 were suppose to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 had to go back to the same place @CAPS3 were in, but again my mom says stay patient. One of the officers over at the place saw how long @CAPS3 were waiting @CAPS2 once the next bus arrived after @NUM9 hours and @NUM10 minutes he held everybody else up let me and my family get on, and tolled the driver “take them by there self,” @CAPS2 @CAPS3 had the bus to our selfs, and you know what it was all worth it.

There was a time when I had to wait on handling my personal have it. My sisters and I came into the house and one of them went to handle there personal have it while I was being patience to not you and knock hard on the door. Telling her (@ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS1) to @CAPS3 in the whatever they doing. By the way @ORGANIZATION1 is @NUM1 years old and @CAPS1 is @NUM2 years old. Had waited and waited be very patience not to be laying “@CAPS3 up,” @CAPS4 on I really have to we handle my personal haveit “ ??? something like that. It felt good to be very patience them to be a non patience people because think about when if you really have to handle something in the bathroom or restroom people will think you are a rushing ??? instead of a patience. Any way they will talk about it to anyone that he/she know at a bad thing when they are just talking about any thing. Last this not a time where e wait to patience to other.
<START>

Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if it’s a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn’t believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad’s dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, “will you use it?”
<START>

A person I know thats paitent is my dad he is very paitent like one time we were in the drive through at mc donalds and soon as we pulled up the lady was like just one second and she but ??? sitting there for @NUM1 minutes and I saw like getting out the ??? and go in the resturant and order my food but my dad he just sat there adjusting gas until the lady came back and I was so mad that the lady made us sit there for @NUM2 minutes, but then I was happy cause I got my food. Then when we were putting off my dad said see that’s why paitients got ??? and my double chess barger and my large ice tea with chocolate chip cookies and my dad taught me a ??? lesson??? ??? ??? ??? nothing but drama and not happiness.

The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride shoot the @CAPS1 at @CAPS2 point. Frist @CAPS2 point was fun but waiting in line took patients we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was to long of a wait. I had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was exited to ride the rollar coster so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting but it was worth it when i got to ride. As you can see sometimes its good to stay patient but when you get to do something fun its worth it.When people push you just had to stay calm and be patient.
<START>

I’m always patient I’m really patient until my birthday then when I get presents I don’t need to be patient anymore because I wait a year for presents and then I wait for @CAPS1 because its only like a month away from my birthday And this year I’m being patient until @CAPS1 because I’ve already know what I’m getting. But that what I’m patient for just about nothing else I’m patient for.

Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4’d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didn’t belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “@CAPS3!” I shouted, “I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop” I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  “@NUM1 minets till midnight” @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me “That’s impossible” I told her. “You can make it.” @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. “@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen” how is it going to end” @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. “@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad” @CAPS10 asked. “I guess not” I answerd sheepishly. “Being patient payed off’ @CAPS10 lectured. I didn’t reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that I’m a little better at being patient things will be a lot better.

One time I was patient because, the teacher had to tell me something. So I wated by the door but then she had to go to the office so I had to wate. When the teacher came back she told me thanks for being patient. Patients really means you can wait. Some kids don’t be patient they get so made for example, there was @NUM1 kids in one group we were playing a game and they would get so made because they didn’t get called on a lol. But the game was radom you pick stick and who ever sticks it was went. So being patients mean you have to able to wait.

Patience is something or someone who like waiting for someone or something patience part of life I sometime don’t have patience but I should have patience without patience you will get not because something in lift you have to want for and that is why you should have patience.

“@CAPS1 go!”, I yelled while running to the entrance of @CAPS2 @CAPS3. “@CAPS4 a minute, you got to @CAPS4 for your friend”, my mom said. As I stopped to @CAPS4 for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1 and @CAPS5 brother @PERSON2 I started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied. Once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park. “@CAPS1 go to the top @CAPS7 @CAPS8”, I said histaticly. “@CAPS9, we can go on it, but me and @PERSON1 are staying in the back”, my mom said. “@CAPS10 because me and @PERSON3 are going in the front row!”, @PERSON2 yelled. As we started to walk to the line it said that it would be a @NUM1 minute @CAPS4 for us to go. After we got in line I thought to myself, wow this is a long line. It wasn’t that much longer that we finally got to the rollercoaster ride. “@CAPS11!”, the belt bucble sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster. “@CAPS12!”, everybody said when we took off.  After that I told myself I can be patient.

@PERSON2 and I went to the slove. @CAPS1 was picking up some marsh mellows and chocolate to make someone. @CAPS1 was walking??? Ial six when @CAPS1 came upon a huge bunch of people looking to bye stuff for smiles. So @PERSON2 and I went in the line. @CAPS1 sat there for at least fifty minutes waiting for marsh mellows and chocolate; but @CAPS1 came out with two –mash mellows and two chocolate packs. I asked her “@PERSON2 why do you have two!” @CAPS1 said that when I waited they were getting rid of them so they gave me two to the same of one. I smiled and we??? Thank you! When we went back to the car we told @CAPS2 other sister “@PERSON1” that we get two @NUM1 said???” @CAPS2 sister snicked we went back into @PERSON2’s car and but the bag in the trunk were one other???cry’s were and then toke off. We got home and @PERSON1 ate three, I ate, two and @PERSON2 ate five @CAPS1??? us. Thank you.

Today I’@CAPS3 going to write about a friend of mine who is very patient. My friend name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second, there I came back an hour later and she was still there she is absolutely the most patient and the most awesome girl I know! On test(like @CAPS3.E.A.P) she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely (ha ha and her last name is @CAPS2). At the @ORGANIZATION1 she doesn’t await in a long line for a corn dog.Now I’@CAPS3 starting to think that @CAPS1 enjoys waiting. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesn’t mind to wait for me when I have to do something.

Patience you are under standing and tolerance experaners differ allys with out complaining. I will tell you about a time wen I was patient. “I gonna tell your mom that you broke the hole in the wall” @CAPS1 you don’t bye me this” @CAPS2 yelled. That is an exsampel of black mail one of the many things you have to be patient with in your life. @CAPS2 is a six year old girl that I baby sit.one day she was at my house we wer playing a game that involved kiking a showe into a wall. Wen it was my turn I kiked the shou into the wall literally. My mom came home and I told the boys did that of corse she bileved me. But the one thing I had to do with was that thair was a witness. The six year old that cant keep a secret. I told he not to tell my mom because @CAPS1 she did I would get in big troble and she would not be abel to come over any more. We went to the store and she discovered the glory of black mail she said she would tell my mom @CAPS1 I didn’t buy her icecreem. I a @NUM1? F day. I refused to  buy her ice creem so she told my mom my mom didn’t care.

Aplause  filled the building after the first dance ended. I was back stage with my dance team going over routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crouded and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform and it was at least five hours long. “@CAPS1 many more dances?” and “what dance are we on?” @CAPS2 what everyone had on there mind or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on excited bored and nervous. Then finally it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting  that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing. Great things take patience!

One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called modern, if you don’t know what that is I’ll tell you. Well modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love, a spote park mony and tree stuff. I went there with my mom I told her she doesn’t have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stared well I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me cheered me and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met.

Being patient @CAPS4 a great trait to have. When you are patient you are respected. That @CAPS4 why I have alot of respect for @CAPS7 teacher. @PERSON1. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 a very patient person. If you didn’t understand something she will work through it with you until you understand. Even it takes a couple of weeks. One time she was teaching us how to add negative numbers and I didn’t understand and she worked with me until I understood. She was very patient. Let me tell you what happened. “@CAPS1 class today we are going to add negative numberC” @CAPS2 @CAPS4 going to be a breeze I thought silently to myself. Little did I know I would not know what to do at all and @CAPS7 teacher was going to have to be very patient with me. When @CAPS7 teacher was done explaining the rules to adding negative numbers I was already lost “ @CAPS3 are some sample problems that everyone needs to try,” said @CAPS7 teacher. A few minutes later she went to every student and checked there answers. When she got to me she had a worried expression on her face. “@CAPS4 everything all  right you didn’t do your sample problems” she asked me. “I dont understand @CAPS2” I replied. @CAPS7 teacher fell silent for a moment and then she said “come see me after class” @CAPS5 I waited until the end of the day and then went to see her. “I noticed you were having trouble with math today” said @CAPS7 teacher. “@CAPS6 were gonna fix that.” @CAPS7 teacher sat down with me and explained what to do in steps. After about twenty minutes of her explaining to me how to do it I finnaly began to pick it up. @NUM1 minutes later I was doing it. “You can go now” said @CAPS7 teacher. “You now understand it better than the other students.” “thanks for being @CAPS5 patient with me” I said before I left . @CAPS7 teacher just smiled. That was a time when @CAPS7 teacher was very patient with me. And I am glad that she was

Whistle, whistle, that was the sound of the soccer refs blowing their whistle for sub`s. (I was playing defense.)  @CAPS1 was calling my name to take me off. When I got off the field I got my water bottle and sat on the subed in until finally I asked my coach if a could go in. his response was you just got off. In my mind I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in. when I got on the field realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes then got subed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patients. I asked my coach if I could go back in, he said sure. When the game was over I realized why my coach benched me so much of the game because he likes @LOCATION1 wolverines and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face. This is a time I was patient.

This is a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when my mom went to go buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me some new pair of shoes because I haven’t had a new pair of shoes in months. I was very patient that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes. I know when my mom has some money, and I need something new she gets it. I was waiting patiently for my mom. I had confidence that my mom would by me the shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door, I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes.

Real @CAPS3 was one of fastest runners in @LOCATION1. No one could catch him beat him in a race, or even sneak up on him. This made him very, impatient.

"@CAPS1…@CAPS2… @CAPS3…@CAPS4…are …You…doing?" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was furious with the fact that no one was as fast as he was. So he ran away. He ran away. He ran as fast as possible. It only took him @NUM1 minutes and he was already in @LOCATION2. In @LOCATION2, he said that people didn't walk and was fast as he could. But that didn't when him team talk to them.

@PERSON1 is a young boy with a bladder of a squirrel and his waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited for his turn. @PERSON1 was in the middle of the line behind five people. @PERSON1 was a head of six people that were all doin the pee-pee dance. He learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it. @PERSON1 learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes.

One time I was patient was when me and three other of my friends were hanging out at school one day. We were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile. Since it’s a relay one person goes to run a mile, then the second person goes once the first person I done, after that the third person goes after the second person is done with his mile, then finally after the third person went I got to go run a mile because I was the fastest at running a mile. Since I had to wait until the very end I had to have patience to wait and then finally go.

You @MONTH1 have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you don’t know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. The opposite of this probably having a temper, or having a @CAPS1 short time before you get @CAPS1 angry. I believe having patience in life is @CAPS1 important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots I related life to sports, because I am a @CAPS1 good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my reciever drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you’re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, “@CAPS2, don’t do it again.” @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don’t make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concitrate on winning next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtue a person can have.

Have you ever been patient or been told your patient? Patience has Patience is a @NUM1 year old girl who is always told how patient she @CAPS1 is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One day patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in juancey so her mom started to look it up on the internet. It take her mom two weeks to get every thing ready, she had the amusment park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they are going to stay at @TIME1. The whole time patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her an amusment park. When they got to the hotel Patience mom had to get the room key get to their room unpack and get dressed to go. The whole patience didn't say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time patience did not complain. They finally got their ticket and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a looong line for that to, Patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. Her mom said ''ok '' and they waited for an hour until they get to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had fun. That is patience story of being patient. I hope you liked it.

A time when I was patient is when I play volleyball. I’m patient when I play volleyball because when you don’t score points, you don’t get to serve. One game we weren’t doing so well and I really wanted to serve because my overhand was doing great. Everybody got to serve except me on that maten. In the end our team ended up winning  I never complained one time about not being able to serve. Every body cheered and chanted because won by two points.

That's gotta hurt! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game.

Here I was on @CAPS1 third day of volley ball tryouts. I was sure I was going to be on the A team. I tossed the ball up and let @CAPS3 drop back down. The toss was no good. I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. “@CAPS1 last serve” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didn’t make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word “congradulations.” @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldn’t of had @CAPS3 any other way.

Patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something . Some people can be very, very patient. But other people have no patient at all. Like if your waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of thing an your in a bit of a rush. Now yo could be rude and yell, him or her scream and all that crazy mess or you could wait patient and maybe she will let you cut. That’s what patient is to me.

Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you.

It was a hot @DATE1 day in @CAPS1 my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. We went on all of the rides. Our last one was the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The line was short when we were walking there. Once we got there the line was all the way to the train. It was like waiting for a pig to fly. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My dad and mom stayed to save our spots. When we got back my parents were another back. "@CAPS4 are we so far back?" my brother said. My parent got out of line so they could get a drink. Ten families wanted got in line. We waited and waited until, something spontanious happend to us. The ten families were is the wrong line so we got to be in front (behind three other families). My family and I had so much fun it was worth waiting.

Everyone has to have patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say “Patience is vertile.” @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”

It was @DATE1 and @PERSON4 was in class messing around at his desk like usual. @PERSON4 isnt usually the patient kind of a person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and @PERSON4 had thought in his head that it was the one of the best answers. @PERSON4’s hand shot straight up in the air. One of the first hands raised. “@CAPS1! Lots of answers.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry said. @PERSON1 berry is kind of more of a round person, with some big glasses to see. But all of the students love her as an @CAPS2 teacher, “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 whats your answer?” @CAPS5 I was just scratching my head. Okay @CAPS6.” “@CAPS7 language?” @CAPS8 good answer though”. There were about @NUM2 more hands in the air. In @PERSON4’s head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. “@CAPS9 these last @NUM3 people and then we will go @CAPS5.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry exclaimed. @PERSON4 was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. “@CAPS10”. @PERSON3 said. “@CAPS11 a metaphor?” @CAPS10 answered. “@CAPS13 you’re right it was a metaphor.” “@CAPS14 darn it that was my answer!” @PERSON4 mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer @PERSON4 was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently.

I am a person with barely any patience at all. We waited, and waited, and waited for an hour. Today wasnt my kiday day. She called out a persons name it was hot mine. We waited for a total of @NUM3 hours and then the doctor finally called my name. After the @CAPS1 got removed I went home to sleep. That was a time when I had to be patient.

A time I was patient was when my grandparent and I were driving to florida. It took about one and a half days to arrive. Then it took us six hours to get to @LOCATION2. My uncle @PERSON1, his wife and his four boy went also. They had rented a house for us to stay with them. On @DATE1 which was the after we got their we went to @LOCATION1 to see my grandpa’s sister @PERSON2. That took us about an hour and thirty minutes because we got lost. The last time we went to florida was to see my cousin @CAPS1 get @CAPS2. No, his little sister was getting @CAPS2 , I couldn’t wait to see them. The wedding was @CAPS3 I couldn’t understand it.So I waited for it to get over. After the wedding we went back to my aunt’s house. On @DATE2 we went to the flea market and it was huge. It took us an hour to look at the whole thing. I wanted to leave at stand fifty-five but I had to by something for my mom and dad. So again I waited patiently for us to leave. On @DATE3 we left to go home. We got here around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. I was so tired I almost fell asleep on the floor. So the whole ride their and back I waited patiently.

Being patient is a very important skill to have. You need this to live your life. With out patients your life would be very crazy. One time when I was patient and had to wait for it when it was time it felt good. One day about @NUM1 years ago. I went to @ORGANIZATION1. And if you have been there then you know how long the lines are. They can be up to about a hour and a half. I was waiting for my turn to go on the haunted hause. It looked like it would be a lot of fun. Then when I got there it looked like there were @NUM2 people in line at the time. My mom asked, “@CAPS1 do you want to go on a different ride and then come back and do the hannah I love?” I told her no and we got in the line. After about @NUM3 hour in line, there was only about @NUM4 people in front of my mom and and I. Then it was finally our turn when I got to sit down in the chair and be buckled in, it felt good to know that after waiting for a long time I did it , I was patient. I did peeping asking if it was our turn, I just stood there patient. That was the time I realized that I had been patient. I knew from then en that I really could do it, patients. Its an important skill to have and to help you live your life well without it being crazy

Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you “don’t have the time” to do something then you don’t have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldn’t be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldn’t be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.” @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now

@PERSON2 stepped out of his warm house and out into the cold, blowing air. He slowly walked, staggering on the ice, out to the barn. The barn was unlike any other. It was a pitching barn. @PERSON3 trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn, and I had turned on the heater. I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, @PERSON1, caught the ball everytime. @PERSON3 said, @CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball." I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked." "@CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!" @PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said "@CAPS3!" "@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise," @PERSON2 said. I threw one. @PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls." You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more," he said. He never lost patient with me. Not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches I had finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. @PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on @DATE2." @CAPS5 is @DATE1. Right?"I asked "@CAPS6 day!" he said cheerfully. He gave me a hug. I love @PERSON3. Not just because he is my dad. Also he is a great man. Happy, funny sweet and patient @PERSON3."

Once when me my dad were supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait until my dad and he said he was getting of work at @NUM1 oclock and that’s the time the races starts. It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasn’t going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in there cars. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. @CAPS1 they did figure eight boat race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said “no w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.” @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2.

When ll was going to @LOCATION1 with my family I had to be patient. Our flight left at @TIME1 am so we were there at @NUM1. We waited for two hours. Nobody complained because we each had something to do. Me and @PERSON1 were playing video games, and my mom was reading ,When we finnaly got on the plane it took three hours to get to @LOCATION1 and no one complained then either. So this is the story of the time when nobody complaind for five hours!
<START>

On a super hot summers day, me, my mother and @CAPS1 all went to best western. The reason is that we don’t have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasn’t worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe.
<START>

One time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play the game I had wait a while so went to my friends last of sitting and watching I am never patient when theres food involved I don’t like to wait for my food it sucks when I have to wait. I don’t know any other time I was patient I don’t like to be patient.
<START>

There I was on a cold @DATE1 @TIME1. Still almost pitch black. I was hunting in my blind with my dad so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost @NUM1 hours not even making a sound. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about @NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner.

Today I had to @CAPS1 Patient @CAPS2 of the meap. The meap is a @NUM1 to @NUM2 day @CAPS3. It has writing, reading, math. It is the hardest thing you will have to do in school. I think it is the hardest thing in life, but it helps you learn a lot more and it might help with your future jobs.
<START>

A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once apon a time their was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient so the hole world new her as the un patient. @PERSON1 hated that name so she though to let self and she said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I make them @CAPS3 calling me that. So @PERSON1 went around her street and asked everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called the unpatient. NO body would tell her the answer so @PERSON1 sceawed out loud @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called The unpatient.  Then @PERSON1 heard a vocie it was an old man his name was @CAPS4 and he's said I no @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 @CAPS3 being called that way @PERSON1 said @CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then @PERSON1 though to herself I got to be patient. So what @PERSON1 did was she went to the store and you no what she did she got in line and she was patient so when everybody went they said good job @PERSON1 and everybody stopped calling her unpatient.
<START>

Have you ever been patient? I have, one time me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to @CAPS1. When we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menu’s and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasn’t frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again.
<START>

Sometimes I done show patience and sometimes I Do. Being patience is being @CAPS1, @CAPS2, And @CAPS3 the good charater traits that a leader has. Without patience you’ll @CAPS5 up at every thing hard you Do. So be leader, a person who @CAPS4’t @CAPS5 up.Be a person who you love in addition be every thinG you can be. Remember, patience is every thing.

Have you ever waited for something that seemed so @CAPS1 away, that seemed to take so @CAPS2 to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have, just @DATE1 I took the @CAPS3.A.T to get into the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, also know as @CAPS8, (@NUM1-@CAPS9) I had to wake up at @NUM2 am, on a @DATE2, to get ready. I had to beat @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM3. When I got there, I had to wait in line for @NUM4 minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took @CAPS10 @CAPS11 to take the test! With three breaks! However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about @NUM5 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the, we all got solo way afterwards and roamed the campus. It turned out to be a great day!
<START>

@CAPS6 was @NUM1 at night, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was sooo anxious to know what I had gotten for @CAPS1 the next day. I couldn’t go to sleep at all, because I was so excited for that awesome day to get my presents and celebrate @CAPS1. I love @CAPS1 because of all of the joy, fun, and happiness in everyone’s sprit @CAPS6 is very rewarding and good to wait for things because if you wait, then good things will come to you and those around you.sometimes I already know some of the things I had gotten (because my mum is a bad hider)  for @CAPS1 I am patient with others others  because I would like for them to be patient with me as well. Treat others how you would like to be treated. I think @CAPS1 is the most joyful time of the year, don’t you? @CAPS6 is fun to fellowship with pets, friends, and family because you become closer well, that is my patience response. Thank you for your time @CAPS9

I chose to write a story in my own way about patients. Patients is how long you can stay waiting for something or someone. Like in a restaurant you be patient and wait for your food. In an airplane waiting area you be patient for the plane to land and get ready for departure. Those are the things I know about patience.
<START>

I have to be patient all the time when I’m teaching my puppy (@PERSON1) right from wrong when are you patient? @PERSON1 is a new part of my family and he is still learning right from wrong. I try to teach him things every day and when I go over it like @NUM1 times I get kind a mad. Mom tells me that @PERSON1 is just learning and to be patient with him it helps train him faster! I have to be patient when teaching @PERSON1 new things and if I’m patient he will learn faster

It  was a cold @DATE1 @TIME1 and the @NUM1  and @NUM2 grade football teams were playing at  different  times one at @NUM3 and one at @NUM4 and of course there was @CAPS1 leaders, and I just happened  to be one of them. The game starts at about @NUM3 o’clock and we started cheering. After about @NUM3:15 we were getting very cold we were wareing our warm-ups but we were still cold. So now that we were cold we were  getting kind of cranky. As half time came it was even colder. We all took a brake and went and got some hot chocolate. Well of corse  we were in a hurry to get back to the  bleachers to sit down, well I started to walk faster and faster then I dropped my hot cholate  down the front of me. Well I was mad but I’m a @CAPS1 leader so I have to be happy. Then we started cheering again and it was colder than when we started but we just kept cheering but then some of the @CAPS1 leaders decided they wanted to take off there warm-ups and if more pepole want to take them off well all have  to take them off so we did. And we froze  but we held in there until the @NUM7 game was over. Then we all went home and probubly went to bed.

I think patience comes into role in a lot of places. For example you have to be patient to get a job or else the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Another place you would have to be patient to be successful. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, thats not patience. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it. Lastly if you have to wait for it not get it right away, if you money from your job you don’t just go rob the place you have to be patient and you have to wait.

Once I was at an airport in @LOCATION1. We were coming home from @LOCATION2. After we got off the plane we had to go to customs. There were only two people working for @LOCATION3 citizens. The line was very long. After half an hour we were only half way through the line. There was a lot of waiting and a lot whining but we finally made it through. Of course they all thanked us for our patience and once the passport were stamped we were on our way to the next flight.

Being patient is waiting and not getting frustrated. When my family and I went to @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION1 state game. My dad was Patient and that is unusual because he is normally in patient.

When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen.

Patience is having control over yourself write you wait. In order to be patient you have  to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. @CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. Fon example if you go to the doctor office for a yearly check up , you have to sit in the waiting room for at reast one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an @CAPS1 is ,is something someone mode up. Not that people have patience

One time when I was patient, I got rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher my class a leaf project. We had to collect @NUM1 leaves to get @PERCENT1. When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them. To do this to a leaf you will have to put the leaves in newspaper then put books on the newspaper so the water will come out of the leaves on to the newspaper. It takes a long time to do this process and sometimes you half to do this a couple times for each leaf. I had to be patient because the first due date was coming up, but mom said to form my project in the next due date. So since I was patient, my project got done before the second due date and got @NUM2 extra points. So when your patient you can get rewarded

Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient, I understanding but I am not that tolerant. Some people though, are tolerant and understanding or patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the @NUM1 grade my math teacher’s assistant had to be so patient with our because they would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and than have to reteach it before to living questions. I was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask questions. I could never be as patient as she was teaching those people.

One time I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother @CAPS1 went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened, out of nowhere a car drifts into his lane then @CAPS2. Since our truck didn’t have air bags it was a bad situation. The other driver was in a van with air bags. About @NUM1 minutes later my mom got the call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could to the seen of the crash. I had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to to get @CAPS1. I waited patiently and I was praying he was alright. And thankfully my prayers were answered.  He just got some bumps and bruises. But the car got towed away. We later went to were truck was to get our belongings. And see what happened to the truck the damage on the truck was not nearly bad as what happened to the other drivers van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But I’m glad I still have my brother.

I’m going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. When you we’re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it’s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, but now, I’m done. (yes!)

One time when I had a lot of paitenits is when I sprined my one ice skating. I was doing spins and trichs everywhere, and one I did not land. I fell on my back, but the bone I hurt was my arm, my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I fell. My arm was hurting so bad from it. So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting @NUM1 times more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to devnlop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didn’t break my arm, however I was in a lot of pain waiting for the resualts. It took a lot of paients for me to just wait, and, wait, and wait for those x-rays,

It was cold fall afternoon. Meant my grandpa where out on a hunting trip. We had geneat in the mornig @CAPS1 nolvek. Little did I know what would happen that day. We got settled into ground blind at about @NUM1. From what we saw it would be a long afternoon. We sat there @NUM2 hours @CAPS1 it seemed like an eternity. We waited and waited @CAPS1 still no deer. All of a suddn my heart racer at the sight in the front of our blind. We had lured the biggest her I have ever seen. It was a monster sised deer. @NUM3. @NUM4 feet tall and a @NUM5. Rack. I loaded my @NUM6 special and shot it in the shoulder. I was so excited I almost screamed. As is any story there is a lesson. Some are respect  your elders. @CAPS1 mine is patience is rewarded. and as you can see I was rewarded.

One time I was patient. I don’t want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun.

“Patience is a virtue.” I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you.

I wondered who would win. I just hoped I would. I was nervous. I was also a little bit scared. I didn’t know what was going on to happen. I was very patient to hear who won the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest. I was waiting  for the contest to end .A little bit earlier I played the game. I was currently in first place .I was nervous .I was nervous because if I win I will get two tickets to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS3. I sat quietly in a chair. I tried not to show that I was nervous. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then, my mom said we could wait by riding rides at the fair. First, I went on the tilt I whirl. I was wondering if anybody beat my score during the whole ride. Next, we looked for another ride. I was trying not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got of my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous the whole time. I tried not to think of it too.

I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when she couldn’t find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat was on the on phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isn’t that patient and I learned I’m not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn’t. That’s  the time of when I know  someone was patient.

One day I woke up and looked outside it was snowy +cold. I went to the living room and told my mother that I wasn’t feeling well so my mother checked my tempture and said I had a??? .I also had a runny nose so she said I probably had a cold. She had to go to work @DATE1 and she said she would stay from work to stay home with me. So she made my hot chocolate and breakfast every time I need something she just got up and got it for me. Every time I needed something like a drink, food or even another blanket she got up and got it for me. She was patient because every single time I asked for something she got it without complaining she just did what I asked her to do. She even went up town to get me my medication. That is why my mother is the best and patient.

There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were getting @NUM1 pug puppies from a nice lady who lived @NUM2 minutes away. I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs. I guess good things really do come to those who wait!

I had patience when my dad din because we had to wait for the doctor to tell us we could see him, but after a while the doctor came and said that he went into a seizer and then a stroke.

The doctor said that "we will keep him over night to observe him" @CAPS3 the next day went to the hospital and after a white they had to pull the plug. I had patience in that store because I waited in the labb of the hospital, and waited for the doctor to tell us what happened and when they took the @CAPS1-@CAPS5 and lastly when they said the need to pull the plug on him. @CAPS3 that's my story about when I had patience.

Sometime it can be hard to be patient, @CAPS1 me it needs to be something I want or want to do. It was a cool day in @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C.I had just turned @NUM1 and was going to meet president @PERSON1 face to face! I won a contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the white house a man took us inside. He led us to a little room then left. It was around @NUM2 then. He said we can't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited played hangman and saws other @CAPS3. Then it was around noon and I was hungry. Around @NUM1:30pm @PERSON1 came in! He said "would you like something to eat?"I said "yes"….we went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce. He said sorry @CAPS1 having to wait, but I didn't care it care it was worth it.

A time when I was pacient is when I’m at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill pacients is the key. For example when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to hand stand it was difficult. Day after, day I never could do it. I put my personl best ever day but I had to be pacient my coach said. He said when the day comes you’ll do it but until then you need to keep trying and do the best you can do. It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill he said. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my coach told me “I told you that you could do it it just takes time and patience but today was your day and you did it. This is a time I had to use patcience to get my new skill. I learned being pacient is hard and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you.

Book @CAPS1 ‘And the characters lived happily ever after……..for now!’ @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages we’re left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results we’re very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “@CAPS3’s wrong!” @CAPS11 her mom. “@CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish.” “@CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience” said mom. “Patience? @CAPS3’s that?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don’t complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient.” “@CAPS6 I’m waiting” said @CAPS7 “@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot.” The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. “@CAPS9” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS3’s this?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “@CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12’s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.” “@CAPS13 you” said @LOCATION1. She couldn’t belive @CAPS12! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait.

A time that I was patient was when my family and I was going to get @ORGANIZATION1's autograph. We were standing in line for hours. My legs were crapping and paining but I didn't care was to excited to worry about anything. I just wanted his autograph and eventually I got it!

One day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All @NUM1 of the coaches tryed to get it off. All of them except for one, coach @PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me trying to get it off. When we realized it wasent coming off we had to find the @CAPS1. When we found him we asked for bolt cutters. We had o walk all the way across the school to get them. Once we had them we had to walk back to the locker room. When we got there he tryed to cut the lock. He tryed for @NUM2 min. They wouldent work. So we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. This one finally cut the lock after @NUM3 min. I think this took a lot of patients from coach @PERSON1.

A long wait   @CAPS1 ‘only four’ at the time. I had moved to @LOCATION4. Yes, moved to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4 from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didn’t care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasn’t four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn’t hate the idea but I didn’t love it either. Of course. It didn’t exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn’t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. I’ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficult has been that I don’t get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now I’ll get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I can’t wait! For years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity !

Patience. It was a warm @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was at my sister’s house playing  wii with my niece, when my brother in law matt comes into the living room and says, “@CAPS1 bored, lets do something today!’’ @CAPS2 we all decided that we would go to michigans adventures for the day. My sister @PERSON1 told us to pack the coler with snacks and drinks and to put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But little did we know that we were actually having six hours to @CAPS3 to go to six flags and that @PERSON1, matt and my mom have been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours i moaned “are we there yet?’’ “no.’’ said @PERSON1 “were lost” “oh”  I replyed. But I really didn’t think about how were lost because weve been to michigans adventures a thosand times before. For the rest of ride there i was pretty quiet. In other words @CAPS4 was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitment. I stretched and squinted from the sun’s  raise when my eye adjusted to the light I looked around and realised that we were at six flags! When we got in the first ride we rode was the supeman on that ride you sit and things lock around your legs and stomache and i tilts you over @CAPS2 its like your flying we wanted to ride it @CAPS2 bad but the line was @NUM1 ½ hours long. While we were standing in line we found things to do like swing and play on the metal railing, play I spy and all sorts of things and when we finally were on and off the ride I realized that it was really fun, and worth it and that i was patient and didn’t complain.

My mom is very patient. The reason why my mom is patient is because when she goes to the beauty shop she calls @NUM1 hours of waiting not a long time. Another reason she is patient is because if I don't do my chores she dozent get very upset she just ask me to do it again. My mom is also very patient when it comes to work because she does not get frustrated when  she has a lot of work to do like writing  a @NUM2 word paper

Patience is??? our or waiting???Patience is dealing with teachers at school and trying to understand their point of view. Without patience you and your younger sitting or young??? teacher would  constantly be  fighting. That’s why patience is as important. Patience should be constantly exconsiled.

In my life there has been many times were I have been patient and times when have hot been patient. For example the other day I asked my mom if she would drive me to target I could got gum. My mom said you but I had to with a little bill. I was patient by waiting for my mom to take me. When I got to target my mom told  me to ???  up. I ran into  the ???  in the  pay ???  so I had to wait. Instead of getting all mad I was patient. Also instead of my mom getting mom she was also patient. One example of me being impatient is, about. Week ago when I asked my dad do play ??? with  me. He said  you but  you have to wait a whiler. I got very mad for some reason and lost my patience. I started yelling why I have to wait. I then reach  I was having rate and that I lost any patience. I said sorry and then we played  catch.

Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.

@CAPS2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1! The sound ratling through @CAPS11 cars. All  I can think about is after @CAPS6 and lunch. I grow more impatient as the clock ticks and @CAPS11 heart throbs. I do not like the meap for that reason. During the reading selection all I think is, “@CAPS7 has to be the most boring story in history “then I turn the page, @CAPS8, @CAPS7 one is, “@CAPS9 makes me so impatient. All I wanna do is finish the test. Little beams of sweat read @CAPS9 slow but I do not want to be the last to turn @CAPS9 in. In the writing I think “@CAPS10 am I going to write about?” @CAPS11 hand starts to ache, and @CAPS11 head will pound because of everyones pencil running as if @CAPS9 were in a horror film. @CAPS2-@CAPS1, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over, make sure you have a title and read hand writing. The most nerves working of all, is the math segment. There are question I forgot. All the math teachers seem to cram all of @CAPS9 in @CAPS11 head at once. @CAPS9 is absolutely terrifying. Then while your testing, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts rattleing. Well, if anyone could not tell, one, I am very impatient and two, I do not like the meap. @CAPS2-@CAPS1 is the most annoying sound. Along with many others, I am trying to get a good score. @CAPS2- @CAPS1, little, beams of sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble.

On @DATE1 I was with my dad at @NUM1 am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tried & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many night I heard leaves cracking & I thought is it really true. On my first day I would shoot one I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quick & he ran away. On another day we came out I saw another dies but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & @CAPS1 I aimed & fired! Well that’s what I thought but no it was jamed and @CAPS1 I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walky-talky, & asked “what are you doing.” @CAPS1 I said “I see a doe,” @CAPS1 he said “then shoot it,” & it stood there @CAPS1 I shot again & then it ran away, “I missed” I said all that patience for nothing.

I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like she’s about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says they’re all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew I’d do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a “war.” I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. It’s too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled,” @CAPS1 @PERSON1, that’s not nice, please stop.” @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, “when we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!:” I realized tothem that’s like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldn’t believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept!

A day that I was patient was, one day I was really happy about my birthday coming up. I couldn’t wait to see @CAPS1 I was getting. I though about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me @CAPS1 I was getting. The days past and it fell like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day to try and take a peak at @CAPS1 I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would name faster. So I waited, it seemed like it was takeing forever. The next day I woke up my brother came and jumped on me and said “ah-ah I know @CAPS1 your getting and you don’t. “And I jumped up and said @CAPS1! How come you know and I don’t? “That’s bad tell me please” And he said no “then I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said “I give up” she looked and said just be patient and it will go by faster you only have four days left. “then I walked away. Then days started to go by faster and then my birthday came up I was so happy to finally see @CAPS1 I was getting. And that was the day I was patient.

It takes a lot of patients especially when you are travelling for @NUM1 hours strait. When I was @NUM2 we went to @LOCATION3 for a half a year. Me my mom and my dad left at @NUM3 am for the airport. We waited there for a long time. When we finally got on the plane we took the hour long flight to @LOCATION4. Ten a @NUM4 hour flight to los @LOCATION1. We waited in those airports for a long time. Then came the @NUM5 hour flights to @LOCATION2. That was the longest flight I’ve ever been on. The plane was a huge double deck @NUM6 jet. Then we took the @NUM7 hour flight to hawk bay. It was a really long trip. It took a ton of patients. Well we went there because my dad was making a golf coarse. That takes a lot of patients too but, its a lot more fun. That was the most patient I’ve ever had to be.

Last year t went to @LOCATION1 city with @CAPS1 mom, @CAPS1 step-dad, @NUM1 of   @CAPS1 brothers, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and, @CAPS1 her @NUM2 kids @PERSON1 and sack. The first place we went was he state of liberty. We got in live for the ferry that takes you to the island where the statue of liberty is. We got in the line for the ferry that toves you to the island where the statue of liberty is. The line was hug antic. I thought, "@CAPS4 great" because it was neatly @DATE1 outside and we were going to the waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the live goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty. It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. @CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of way self for not complaining.

Ok it was atime wen I was on a bus to got texas. My mom, and my family was going  to see my great grandfather. The bus smelt good but same lady kept spraying  perfume so i had to just sleep and snack on a couple snacks. I kept gettting woke up by a baby. Everytime  i hold to go to the  bathroom there was always someone in the bathroom. Also when i was trying to sleep every one seems to get louder. So when it was time to catch some  @CAPS1’@CAPS2 my bus driver would wake us up us and we would have to get off the bus to another bus. It seemed  like  never on that bus. You had to have alot of patients or you wouldn’t be able to to just relax when the day is done. I finally got there in @NUM1 days. It  was worth it because we went to six plags. If I didn’t have patience then the experience of being on a bus for @NUM1 days would have been a horrible experience.

Two summers ago I went to @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1. We had to drive for @NUM1 hours straight. I mostly just sat in the back seat and listened to my @NUM2 player. @CAPS1 was a very boring car ride. On the way I looked for licence plates with different states on them.

Then we got to a whole bunch of little booths were you have to show your passport to got in. And finally we were in @LOCATION2. We stayed there for @NUM3 or @NUM4 nights.

So I had to be patient. I could not wait until the game came out. It seemed like it took forever. It was the day befor the game came out and I lost my money that I was going to use to get the game. So then I had to save up @NUM1 more dolllers to buy the game that nI wanted.  I had to get two @DATE1 jobs so that can help me make the money that I lost . so two weeks past by then I went to the game store so I can buy the game. When I walked In the store, the manager told me there are no more copy’s of any basketball games. So I had to be patient for a whole nother @NUM2 weeks, and I get very mad. So I wated @NUM2 weeks for the game and I finaly got the game. I was so mad I had to be  patient that long but I got what it was wroth. So that is my story about being patient.

I remember a time when someone I know was patient with me. It was near the beginning of the @NUM1 grade. I had enrolled in band that year, playing the trumpet. We played songs and had tests to everyone we were playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed something funny on my tests. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long  private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school. I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> broke down the notes for us one by one. He told me  the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again and together. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them being ?? patient with me. Then  finally I was playing every note .The lesson was about @NUM4 minutes and he was patient the entire process. Now i play my notes right that’s to the lesson and @PERSON1’s patience. Now I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on <@NUM2</PERSON>’s patience to come out or there is ?? required classes.

This year I tried out for the @NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For “bragging rigts,”we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didn’t play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like it’s the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadn’t played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, ”can you do it?”I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!

The word patience means a lot of things. It can mean waiting and something and much more. It also talks a lot ??? It takes time and effort. I’@CAPS1 the type who complain a lot and I don’t have patience. Other people they don’t complain they an it. A lot of teenagers have no patience. As you get older you develop patience some adults don’t have patience it depends on if you work at it. It also depends on whether the person has gone through in life.

My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill it’s over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn’t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave.

Patience is when you wait for something with out complaining. A time I was patient is when I was @NUM1 years old. It was about @NUM2 that day but the winds were picking up just a little. I was being patient si icould go into a ride in @LOCATION1 adventures. It was shimbering timbers. The line was very and when I mean very I mean long. It took me about a half of hour to get on ride. Another ride I waited for was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. But that one was shorter. It only took about @NUM3 minutes. All these  rides have to show patiene because if I didn’t show patience I wouldn’t be riding the good rides. The last one is when I was @NUM4. I wanted to ride the thunder hawk and the line took like for a whole hour. I played my nintendo as while I was waiting so it could be patient. An hour later I got to ride that ride all because of patience.

I played soccer for a rec.Team called the cheetahs. Rec means I was in the best division possible you could be in. Rec soccer was fun, but my two best friends and me were doing all the work no one else on the team were not doing anything. So I decide to go try out for a select team. A select team is in the second highest division you can be in. When try outs came I was really nervous. After I tryed out for three days, if you were selected you would get a phone call saying you made the team. It took long time to get a phone call it felt like it took a country. In between those days I had to wait and wait and wait and wait and so on, when you wait for a long period of time thats called patience.

I think patient is when some one is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named @CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework., chores, take care of her sister and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because are she had was a math work shect ?? @NUM1 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were ?? addition and subtracts. That took her @NUM2 minutes, (@NUM3 on each side) which isn’t that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister toys here all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that she’s resting and not making man of mess, @CAPS2 took @CAPS1 about @NUM4 minutes to clean up all the days because all she bad to do was throw them back into the toy bar. Now , we go to her room. Ally messy room you first couldn’t open the door. So she had to tog on the door until she could finally fit her self in. The door slammer shut from all the clothes but luckily didn’t wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a check list of what she needed to do she had to: vacuum, fix her bed , and put all the food away that were in her room back in the kitchen. That took about @NUM5 hour and a half. So in all that’s been about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she had to do clean up the rest of the dinner.  Her mom couldn’t because she had to drop off her dad at the air part for work, so @CAPS2 was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had speghettl for dinner and her sister spilled the house all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @NUM7 minutes, mopped which took like @NUM4 minutes, when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time.

I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Some times we have  to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game  and movie releases. but I am  going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasent waiting for the plane to arive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didn’t like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just  to get our food. It was very crouded and it took all patience to not get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how i was feeling oxbout  my patients is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patients  and stay calm.

I think that my coach is patient because there are @NUM1 girls she is watching . She has to teach us stuff that we don’t know. Our coach has in teach us stuff like the @CAPS1 play and teach us how to do moves like cross overs. She teaches us to run fast, she has to be patient with the slower kids that cant ran as fast. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them all and it for a little of her time , so she had to be patient.

We all don`t like waiting like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. @DATE1 @DATE1 @DATE1 when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. While still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for you flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have. To be patient in waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don’t like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do.

Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait I get this weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache. Weird huh? Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, I was at my @CAPS1 saftey course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside wating. The first group was done @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely were off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth @CAPS2 my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 point buck. That is my story, have a good night!

I’m patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .I sometimes have to wait forever .But that’s fine I can just take a nap .I sometimes hate being patient .It just frustrates me .Waiting for like @NUM1 minutes just for people to finish a test .It’s good because you shouldn’t rush on the @CAPS1. Its justs frustrates me that people take so long .It’s not just at school it’s at my house too. The doctor, dentists at a friends house and and at the library. Man this is so hard to be patient .But it’s not good  to be  in patient .I wish people were as fast is  I am during a test .Then I wouldn’t have to be very patient.O well I guess I’m just going to deal with it man this really stinks being so patient.

Patience is a good thing  to have. Good things come from patience and bad things dont happen. But what is patience? Patience is being ablle to handle problems without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others can’t. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so he had  been saving up his extra money for a new @CAPS1. Once he had enough he got a new “@NUM1” flat screen @CAPS1,but if he had waited only about another week he could’ve gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price. Lets say your little sister is bagging you and you beep nicely asking her to stop but she just won’t. So instead of totally flipping out on her which will get u into  tons of trouble just wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you dont

Once upon a time there was a girl named @PERSON2. She had always dreamed to be a princess. Every present she got was either a dress or jewelry. She loved to try on dresses. She had two sisters both @NUM1(one year older than @PERSON2) there name were @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. @CAPS3 house is an old house located in the woods. One day @PERSON2 went out to get the mail, and a man with a tuxedo on gave her a letter that looked very fancy. @PERSON2 opened the letter and read it aloud, it said “@CAPS2 @PERSON2, your invited to ball at the castle on @DATE1 at @NUM2 pm.” @PERSON2 screamed in exitment. @PERSON2 decided to go to the mall to look for a ball gown. She found a beatifulgown but it was to much money. She asked the lady at the front desk if there was any way they could lower the price was I she helped around the store for a couple of days. She accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours for two days. And fonaly her patients paid off. She could take the dress home. She drove home and put the dress on. She only had an hour so she had to hurry. She put her makeup and jewelry on and looked at her self in the mirror and said I did it. She got in the car and drove to the castle, it was so beautiful the way the moon hit the gold paint. @PERSON2 got out of the car and walked inside the castle. She walked down the stairs and every one stared. It was @CAPS3 best day of her life to have everyone think she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with some guys. The prince came up to introduce him self and when she turned around he fell in love. @PERSON2 couldn’t believe the prince talked to her. He asked her to dance. They danced all night. When the prince went on stage he called her name and she went on stage. He asked her will you marry me, she said yes. She had become a princess! Sometimes dreams really do come true.

One time when I had to be patient was when, i had to babysit. My family friend has a one year old @CAPS1 ,And I have a six year old brother .I had to babysit both of them because my mom and her boy friend were going  to have a double date with our family friends . Things were great until they left .My brother was in preschool at the time @CAPS2 they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do and I had to help him. @CAPS2 I thought ok this will be easy, @CAPS2 i had him read the book and my mom told me that he knows the words @CAPS2 i won’t have to sound out every single one, I had  to he wouldn’t  do the work and the baby wouldn’t quit crying and the dog wouldn’t stop barking (he hate when babys cry) and the house was crazy! @CAPS2 i started to panic. What was I supposed to do? And I didn’t what to ruin my mom plans and i definetly wanted to prove her wrong. @CAPS2 i calmed down and remembered what one of our friends said he told me to be patient. @CAPS2 i let the dog outside and picked up the baby and headed back to the table where my brother was playing. First  i read the book aloud it got both of their attention .then i  told  andi made a game out of doing the work and it was all good .Then  @CAPS4  time came @CAPS2 i made some food that we all liked and set the baby in his high chair with  his food and  gave my brother his plate i turned around and he  trowed  his plate at me  and food was everywhere! I got mad and told myself be patient, i cleaned up the mess and feed the kids and put in a movie and they all feel a sleep! I quietly, cleand up the house and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised i did it. Patence is a big part in life if you loose your temper it just makes things worse.

One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said “@CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later?” I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didn’t seem like much. When we got into the store that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said “@CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?” “I’ll try”. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said “@CAPS4 you for your patients”. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said “Do you see what happens if you be patient?” I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient.

The time I was patient I had trouble with football. I needed help doing everything. But my dad helped me. He taught me how to throw kick, run and kaney. I was patient because I watch them I did it. I saw one help my dad playing we went out to join them. The stuff he tate me was hard but it helped.

Patience is probalbly  one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient, most people will probalbly like you more, for example, if you are in line for something at school, and you were patient, you will probalbly get a “@CAPS1 you” from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park ride’s line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldn’t want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed. This is why I think patience is important.

Fishing is a great sports, but it takes a lot patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about @NUM1 miles from my home. I had loved fishing ever since then, but the trip wasn’t easy. I think that fishing is fun because I was patient accomplishing what I did took every oune of patience I had. When my uncle visits from @LOCATION1 he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a differently. I never went with him until about one year ago. He decided that  I should bring a friend. So if I get boared, I would someone to talk to.The patience started when we were about half way there and @CAPS1 ! We hit a fence. The car had broken down so we called a land break.The wait was about @NUM2 hours, @NUM3 min and my friend asked. So are and my friend sucked .We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way .Once we got there, we had two problem to fix, and we had no bait. We found a nice spot at the other side of the lake. We had to sea venge for some baits, which took about @NUM4 hours for enough baits.We were finally ready to fish. We got the rods, sat the chairs, cast, and waited.There was no way to make fishing faster so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end my uncle, my friend ,and I caught @NUM5 fish ! We had eat three for lunch and went home with @NUM6 fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened but we went fishing , relaxed, and brough a couple of meals. Thats why I have fishing because it requires patience.

One time when I was patient was my birthday I was turning @NUM1. I was very excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone and that’s all I wanted. All of my friends had them I just wanted one because if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn’t know where I was. It is just a need right now because they are very helpful. My birthday was  on a @DATE1 so the night before I was at the football game everybody was asking if I was going to get me and I kept on telling  them yes I’m getting it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs. The first gift that I got was the cell phone and I was really happy and I started to get all of my friends numbers. I learned when your patient and not asking you will get what you want.

The story is about a time I was patient. I am being patient right. I am being patient about waiting for @CAPS1. I’m not a person who ??? to be patient. When I want something I were that second. Cristmas is my favorite holiday. There is so much good stuff about it. There are cokkies, family and present. There is always a problem and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily and if they don’t wrap it very good I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them unpackaged. Something also it seemes to be all holidays are like that. Well I guess we all have to be patient on something I’m being patient on @LOCATION1 football winning the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 and flordia gators. Ficst @ORGANIZATION1 has got to get out of the @CAPS5 bold game thing.

Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that’s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.

The first time I ever was patient before is when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get @DATE1 film out of my camera my mom always promises me to get the film but sense her money was use on ??? She told me to wait @DATE1 @DATE1. So I waited @DATE1 @DATE1 have crine up and this is what happened I ask my mom again can I get my film out of my camera. She said no because she used her money??? school supples. I was happened to wait another @DATE1 @DATE1 so @DATE1 @DATE1 came again. I ask her and she said no because once again she spend her money no paying people back from them helping her out like any dad. So I had to wait until next @NUM1 @DATE1 so I waited, and waited, and finally @NUM1 @DATE1 has pass and she forgets so she had to get groceries. So @DATE1 I ask her one more time and she said. Yes but she had to pay my dad back on helping her and after that she said after school I??? bringing my film out to buy. So how now told you how??? I have waited to do that also had to get a new diginal camera because it has been droped to many time.

Every day at launch I have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch. Especialy when your waiting in line, then you really have to be patient. But sometimes your lucky and you can go to the other line to pay for lunch. And then when you finish lunch you can go out ride and play. But @CAPS1 you must finish your food and throw it away and wait patienty. And thats a time when I was patient.

I was patient in a plane ride going to @LOCATION1. All I did was stare at towers and buildings as I possed exit them. I was also patient when my little brother. Much got a fly shot and I had to wait in the lobby. The biggets time I’ve ever been patient was with my brother and him going through my patient, breaking all my stuff, biting me with his toys and his constant whining or crying over stuff that he wants.
<START>

During the @DATE1 my family and I went to @LOCATION3 for a couple weeks. In the beginning of the second week I did something i have never done before. My two older sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), dad,cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2’s uncle (@CAPS1) and I were on our way to the boat. I was excited, this was my first time fishing in a ocean. A few hours past and we didn’t catch anything,but we still waited while drinking coffe, telling  jokes, doing little  pranks like pulling  each others line to make them think we caught something. We left at @NUM1 am and now it was @NUM2 pm. We still didnt catch anything but dad and @CAPS1 go fishing all the time and said we just had to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later @CAPS3 line started pulling @CAPS1 helps her reach it in, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. Now it was @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just being patient and waiting to catch something but @PERSON2 was also very patient because she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat had to secretly use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home  we told evryone what we caught,which was nothing for everyone besides for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know lots of people who wouldnt last on that boat for an hour. So i was proud of how patient everyone was and i hope to do it again next time i go to @LOCATION2 with my family.

Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It takes self control in order to have patience. Having patience is very important because if you have a gon??? and your not patient maugio wait  your turn here not going to hire you, here not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 but we had to leave at @DATE1 am so I couldn’t go to sleep. I woke up at @TIME1am so I was tired. I couldn’t take a nap because if I did the nap will turn into a deep sleep. Next I and to finish packing ?????????? so I  was really tired and  ?????????? show I was ran because it was  a hour left. When I was done packing. I started to watch t.v to keep me awake because I can’t go to sleep under a ????????. Then   my cousin  had to have his diper changed so I was to change it, but @CAPS1 when I was @CAPS1 about to get ????????????????? called at and said “let’s go.” I was happy because now I get to go to sleep in the rental van.  In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when your really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really was about to make me angry was that I had to change a diper but some how I maintained my patience.

Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just @CAPS1’t control yourself? You ask your parents, “when” and they say, “soon just have some patience!” well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “aww!” everyone screamed. “@CAPS1 I hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. “you are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient @CAPS1 pay off!

I was patient when I was at my friend’s house in the winter shoveling a sleding slot so we can but water on it to make ice. When we where shoveling it was hard become we had to got through lots of snow just  to got to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not patient gye when. We do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patients was because it was getting dark and I has to go soon. But before I became unpatient we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice but that didn’t bother me at all. That’s how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But… I couldn’t  or we couldn’t go on it that night because it was to late. I that’s my story about  patientce  The @CAPS1

Patience is an important part of life and i learned that @DATE1 during hunting season. Most of the @DATE1 we sat and sot saw everything but deer. We were geting to the point where we didn’t want to go anymore but we did anyways. As  the is days went by as it get colder we started to see some does . My step dad @PERSON1 said we will shoot one on the @DATE2 if we dont see bucks. After a few days it was the @DATE2 and we were going to shoot a doe but we didnt see anything most of the @DATE2. When there was about @NUM1 minutes left of @DATE2 light the perfect buck walked into the field.

One day me my mom and my brother were driving in our car. We were going to a beach when sudnly our car wouldnt move. The battery had been run down and didnt work. My mom called a tow truck and said he wouldnt be here for two hours! Me and my brother complained all the time but my mom just sat quiet so whe the truck (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3) got to us ua ome.

One time I was on my way to the bus stop, and I had got their @NUM1 minutes before the bus came so I sat their and I looked at my watch it was @NUM2 minutes past the time I was support to get picked up so I waited and waited so I boked at my watch again it was @NUM3 minutes pass the time I was support to be on the bus. So I was growing in nation but I had thought well buses are???  I sat back down and I wanted because I????was going to ??? and I grew very patient and after @NUM4 more minutes the bus had came, and it had let me on free because I was the only person who  stayed at the stop? So when I got back home my mom asked me how did it in gow I said the bus was late @NUM5 minutes  she said what did you do I said I waited and they let me on free she said that is what you get for being patient.

I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for a ride. I was becoming impatience just waiting their. But sudden ly I saw the line move. So then I calmed down and waited, when it was our turn to ride. I just reilized it was a hour we been waiting. Under standing in patience means you know why you have to stand their waiting. Because you can’t push or shuvie your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you can’t do or get what ever you wan’t unless you truble. You can’t hit, cut, push, or shuve to the front of the line, you just have to wait.

Being patient requires a lot of tolerance. For most people @CAPS6's hard to be patient but sometimes @CAPS6 is very important. A few weeks ago my neighbor really needed a break from her @NUM1 year old daughter @CAPS1. I gladly offered to babysit because I love being with her. I definitely didn't know @CAPS2 I was in for. She came over at around noon and we played for hours. But then she got cranky. I gave her a snack but that didn't help. She start crying so bud I loud no idea @CAPS2 to do. My mom came rushing in the room in panic mode." @CAPS2's going on? Is everything ok in here" she asked. I told her that everythings fine but @CAPS1 is just really cranky. My mom replied "let's take her to the park she will have fun there!" I agreed and off we went. If noticed @CAPS1 likes to do things herself. She insisted on getting in her car seat done, getting on the swings and putting together puzzles. That requires a ton of patience because she takes forever. I love watching @CAPS1 but if I didn't have patient @CAPS6 would be extremely difficult.
<START>

It takes patience when you are out hunting. After about @NUM1 deer seasons my patience paryed off. I was using a bow and ran @NUM2 point walked out. He was about @NUM3 yards from my stand and I called him closer. Then he was @NUM4 yards from my stand. I took the shot and he buckled and the @NUM5 minutes I waited to find him felt like in life time. Then I got out of my stand he ran about @NUM6 yards and droped. When I got to him. I was so excited because he wasn't won @NUM2 point he was a @NUM8 point back. Do remember use the regin blood head and be patient you could shoot the deer of a lifetime.

This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   get’s you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you’ll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you can’t, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you don’t hurt their feelings if they can’t do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don’t get in trouble. If you wouldn’t have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. That’s why you need patience.

I have a lot of patience for example one I really wanted to know @CAPS1 I made volleyball team, and I had patience, I did not complain. I believe having patience is very respectful toward yourself and others. Once I had a test and really wanted to know when we were going to receive it, but I had patience. Others did not have Patience they kept asking what we are going to get @CAPS1 both were complaining they did not have Patience. Another example is we’re going to go to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 and we still had planned the day I did not have ruler here that time, and it made it worse leaving the patience the more thinking about it and that made it work .Men @CAPS1 sometimes more  on and patient and sometimes not so much

There was a time that I didn’t want to be patient but had to be. We as a family were going to go to @PERSON2 common for a holiday. On the way   while we were on the highway, about @NUM1 yards ahead of us, two was nurchaged and bath pulled over. They were beside the? With anger. Soon after that the cops came. Keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this. The cops investigated everything and called in something. @NUM2 minutes later a truck came around the traffic jam and started fixing the road. I don’t know why there was nothing to be fixed. Finally around and how later we were let past, and continued over ride to @PERSON1.

Lots of people are good at being patient I’m not so good at it. But when your traveling along distance, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my @LOCATION2’s house. She lives about @NUM1 hours away, near @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves when family visits, so we don’t mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. I’ve had to have been there at least @NUM2 times in my life time. My mom works the night shift at a well known hardware store. Usually, she works @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. So when she gets off work we would pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drank lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 and started acting like an idiot, singing along to the songs. Until, my @CAPS3 died. I felt my heart break a little. I couldn’t fall asleep now. I was still hyper. I started listening to the radio, but all we could listen to was country. Since, we were going @CAPS7, we were traveling away from the control tower of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached, “The up @CAPS7 store” where we always stop to get gas and food when we go to @LOCATION2’s. I got @CAPS8 and even more pop. I gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished my food and was bored once again. There was nothing to do in that car. I was angry at that point. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the drive way, and my @LOCATION2 running to come greet us. Finally, we were there. I had survived yet another, ride to @LOCATION2’s house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, I’m almost positive will never stop getting bored during the ride. Being patient, is not one of my favorite things to do.
<START>

I want to go see a movie. There are no movies here at home I want to see. “@CAPS1 dad can I go to the movies with someone?” I asked. “@CAPS2!.” @CAPS3 answered. I looked up what movies were in and their was a pretty good selection. I pick the movie I wanted to see. Then I realize I need someone to go with me. I called up my friend @CAPS4 and asked her if she wanted to go see the movie I wanted to see. Ended up she wanted to see it to so, she said yes. After that I got something to eat and relaxed. All over a sudden, it time to leave. I was running behind. I ready really quickly and went and picked up @CAPS4. Unlike me she was calm and patient. In her place I wouldn’t have been. That’s one of the reason why I like @CAPS4 as a friend.

A time when patient was when I went to the glasses place, And I had to get approved to get glass. So the next day my grandma call and ask did @PERSON1 get approved and they said “@CAPS1”, my grandma asks how long do I have to wait and they said four weeks so a week went by and they called and said my glasses are done. So the next day we went and got them and that was a time I was patient.

“@CAPS1” I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer. A front-full is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldn’t land it. My gymnastics’ coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he see’s me he says “my baby!” and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesn’t. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. “@CAPS1” I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic “try again”, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didn’t stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1.

Last @CAPS3 my mom ordered @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was patient for an entire @CAPS3. One @CAPS3, few months and four months and five months to be exsact. Why? Well, the game came out this @CAPS3, on @DATE1 and I had to wait for. How did I pass the time? Simple, don’t think about the game, try not to talk about the game and only write when it comes out on daily calenders. Even though I beat the game exactly thirty two times on every difficulty without any help. (heh,heh!) I still have to wait for another month or so for callop duty:@CAPS4. So this, ah, stinks because now I can’t stop thinking about it.

Everyone should have patience. Living patience will help you because your going to have to be patient sometimes. Sometimes some people can be patience and some people can't be patient and which l am one of these people. Quite sometime l can be patient and can't be patient. Being patient was a hard thing for me to overcome. Well, l didn't! for once l was patience in my life. That time was when a lot of elderly people were coming through the door and finally hold the door for all of them. It wasn't easy because l had to be at a @CAPS1 appointment in about @NUM1 min and it was a lot of them. It took about almost @NUM2 min to wait for all at them to get through the door. But l still continued holding the door after holding the door I was late for my @CAPS2 dppointment all it was still so if a commin ?? holding the door

When I went to get my new phone I had to be patient because my grandma likes to work with a spacific person. The man named @CAPS1 who my grandma and me were waiting for finally came to us so we went to the phase I wanted and he talking for long time, but my grandma said if I wasn’t patient I wouldn’t get my new phone that day. We make it up to the counter and he’s showing thing about the phone, I want to get out of there so I could look at it myself. Me and my grandma finally leave and I have my new phone with and I like it. Name one time you were patient and what you were patient for!

We’ll I’m patient and I’m in the middle patience is all about waiting or juss sitting with someon you don’t like. One time when I was little I was not very patient. My mom wants say had on a couple of seconds and I would say @NUM1. But when I got older I was more patient. Like, I was patient with teachers and peers and parents but there are times that I still have a unpatient side, I will try not to get unpatient but sometimes it juss happens. I love having someone to talk to but some times I can’t talk to them because I’m unpatient. My friends are really good about it first though some time they don’t my mom is really patient but my dad is not so maybe get it from him I don’t really talk to my dad though although I’m unpatient I’m really out going and funny. I have a lot of friends because I’m outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because I’m outgoing and that has a blown side. I love talking and having fun maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment. In conclusion I need more patience but patiuence is a thing I can defiatly work on.

Patience. Wow, you want critism; are you sure? We’ll since you asked for it,  it looks like I’m have to give it to you. Patience is @CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunties and even you and I need (@CAPS1 in these days and times. We about need it every day.) @CAPS2 does the key word patience mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant.  Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining. Or in my own words, long suffering and also are able to wait until @CAPS2 you want is done. Being patient is something that I am not all the time but, need to be. Like my daddy say to me all the time you are not going to always get or receive everything you want to so you’ll have to learn patience. That is one word I do not like @CAPS1 when its something I really want.so that is my story about patience explained my way.

We as the students have @PERSON1. @PERSON2 talks all the time. He talks till luch wich is about for a half an hour. So I have to wait for a while till he gives us work. That how I have patiences. To conclude that when I have to have patience in class. Though I don’t have a lot of patience at all, but in class I do.

“@CAPS1 were gonna be late!” yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on.

She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily.You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parmls, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was estaric. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to @PERSON1’s parents before we left, so @PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to ???? “@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3? I asked safely, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seamed to grow twice their size. “@CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4!  Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!” @PERSON1 yelled??? . Though she made it sound like “???” I smilled and we began tro play. She would guess??? I would let her win. ??? was so ??? and I think I made her more patoient to leave by helping her play a game.Finally my parents walked outside and we began our skitrip. Patience had payed off.

One time I was patient when my little brother was taking a shower and I had to go to the bathroom. So I waited and of cource he locked the door so I tried to pick it with a toothpick, it didn’t work. Then I told my dad and he said “be a man you can hold it in” so that didn’t work either so I was just about to take the door off the hinges and then he walked right out and smiled at me so then I went in the bathroom and it was soaked in water so I yelled at him and that’s wen I was patient.

I’m always having to be patient. It’s because I have an older brother that doesn’t do what he is told. Let’s say my dad tells him to clean the bath room, well it takes him ten minuts to get up, then I have to go when he’s cleaning and he won’t let me. So I’m that’s one of the reasons. Another is my older sister she’s always on the phone so I barely ever get to use it. So I wait until my parents get home so they yell at he to get off, that’s why I’m very patient.

It was @DATE1 and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank hot chocolate. I saw our @DATE1 tree is was full of presents, I couldn’t wait till I could open them. I’ve been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didn’t stop me from hoping. So I wish I got one this year. After a while my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. “@CAPS1” I screamed, I quickly tore the paper off the presents and saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more. But not a wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the wii tomorrow. But she replied “@CAPS2 can’t afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. As @CAPS2 all enjoyed our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watched tv. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the wii. “@CAPS3” thank you “mom” I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived at the?? I got the wii and it ??, which was @MONEY1. I couldn’t believe it, my patient finally paid off. Now I got my new wii, and @CAPS4 enjoying every second of it.

A lot of people in the world are patient. However I think that my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in the dimension she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldn’t just go out and buy food at the grocer store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take. Then finally wait for the shells to pop. That is war hinder then putting a bag in the mircowave and pushing a button. That is how she is also fooled with ??? even with me. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world.

Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with if you are impatient, and then people will say that you are impatient, and needs to calm down. Being patient also means that you are polite person and that you will not complain about anything, also that whatever happens, you will be understanding and you will wait. Let`s say somebody was in a line to get food. You would have to wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his/her food. That is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for litter children/ kids. You are setting an example and being considerate. These are many reasons on why being patient takes understanding, and being considerate.

I sat there quietly for @NUM1 hours! My parents told me that they appretiated now I was very patient. That the time I was patient.

My story in own way about being patience is when there is like @NUM1 people in front of a line a ceter point. You have to be patient in the lines because other were before you so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that you don’t want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat you have wait your turn in line so you don’t get kick out of the rides you have to wait your turn so you don’t get the secrety on you.

The ticket seller said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made @CAPS2 mad, and because she didn’@CAPS1 get in line when she got there, more people got in line.

My brother matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long.   We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matt’s girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those  couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matt’s girlfriend two dollars.

One time when I was patient, I went hunting with my mom. You have to have a lot of patient to do that. When my mom and I were siting in the deer blind she was getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came. But we were siting there for about @NUM1 hours. I was about to lose my patients but then some deer came in, a mother deer and her fawn. My mom didn’t want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be all alone. So we waited for more deer to come in but none did. But I still had my patience in me. when it started to get cold and dark out we thought no more deer were going to come in so we just went home and plus my mom was starting to lose patient a little bit. But that’s the time I was patient for a little while.

When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how tolerant and understanding she is. Even when she has explained something to me about @NUM1 times and I still don’t understand, she helps me without complaining. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. @CAPS1 was the @DATE1 time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad had told me that you needed turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devestated that @CAPS1 wasn’t easy, I gave up a little bit after. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, “turn! Turn!” but @CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. “@CAPS1’s okay. You almost had @CAPS1!” mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up. On my one last try before @CAPS1 was time to go back in the house, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day. She didn’t let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!

Everyone has been patient at one time of their. I know I have. A year my brother and I had a projet to do. That we both needed a computer to finish. I let my brother go first. Being that there is one computer in the house I have to wait. After hours I checked to see if my brother was close to being done.

One time when I was patient was when I went to camp. I had to wait @NUM1 hours till we got to camp. I mostly slept and ate, we also watched movies on @PERSON1 @CAPS1 player. We finally got their, but I had to wait some  more for registration and I had to wait  till the rain stopped so I could get my stuff in our cabin. Next we waited for chapel to start, but there was more to do there like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the lunch room and talk to friend, or last read in your cabin.  When the  bell rang we all went into the program center and waited  for chapel to end. We had a lot of patients by the end of the week. Ohh at lunch we had to wait for seconds because their food was really good. Finally, I had to wait @NUM1 hours on our way back home. This is a time I had patience. (A whole lot of it).

Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you don’t have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didn’t want to wait so she didn’t look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldn’t really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So that’s what happens when you don’t have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so that’s my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences.

One person I know was very patient one time I was associating with them. That one person was waiting for a call or e-mail that was promised to happen. The call or e-mail was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state. The person who was calling or e-mailing the person I was with was coach of that team. He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's game and approached him after the game. They talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him and so he gave the coach our phone number and his e-mail address. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum. On our drive home my brother kept checking his e-mail because it took us @NUM1 days to get home. The @CAPS2 day the coach never called or e-mailed him. The second day still nothing. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out over it not coming. The third day on our trip back home my brother was very understanding when my mother told him that it might not happen. So we get home at @NUM3 o'clock and I am starting to doubt that my brother brother made the team. Then the phone rings. My brother talked for while then hung up and said he made the team. That is one time my brother was patient.

A wize man once said patience is a is a vertue. Lets find out if that wize man is right. I’m going back @DATE1 years. I had just talked to my parents I said. “@CAPS1, call you by me this lego for @CAPS2?” “@CAPS3”, @CAPS5 said then @CAPS5 asked me to move. I kindly moved out of her way and @CAPS5 ordered it. It was @DATE1 when I asked her “@CAPS1 do you know my lego is coming?” @CAPS5 said “it should be here before or after @CAPS2.” I replied with an @CAPS7.K.. it was the week before @CAPS2 I had cheaked the mail. “no package” I thought to my self. So I checked the porch nothing. A week after @CAPS2 the mail man came. On top a package I could see. It turns out the wize man was right patience is a vertue. This is the time I was patient. I also learned its better to wait for some things.

One day my mom and dad were looking up vacations on the internet. They came across a vacation to @LOCATION1 a place just outside traverse city. We decided to go for @NUM1 days it was going to start next month i was excited to go but i still had enough patience to wait and wait till the people called us to tell us that we could go (expecting our reservation) to @LOCATION1. When the day finally came i was really excited. We got everything  packed  and ready to go even the dogs were ready to go. After we put the dogs in we started  to go. We had to have the dogs go to my grandmas because they had no were else to go,so we dropped them of and started heading to @LOCATION1 plus it was four hour drive. When we were about an hour in the drive my sister got really impa tiant and kept asking are we there yet but i just sat there and looked out the window. Then we got to a pitstop and we whent and got our water and drinks. My mom and dad wanted coffee so then tried to get some but it didn’t work so we had to stay there for like @NUM2 minutes and they finally got some coffee and me and mironda were just sitting there the whole time.

Can you @CAPS1 a time in your life when you had to wait for something for a very long time. I had to wait for a long time. Do you think you knew what it is?” it was @CAPS2 eve. I was only five at the time. So I woke upon @CAPS2 eve couldnt wait till tomorrow. I told my self that all day. I went outside to try and waste some time but that didn’t help because it was freezing out side. So had to come right back in the house. I didn’t have nothing to do. So I just kept wait, then “@CAPS4” my brother got up and I just played with him the whole day till we had to go to sleep. Then it was time to go to bed and I ran straight up to my bed room and got right to bed and woke up the next morning and I was so happy that I  didn’t had to wait anymore. I had to wait for ever I was  so happy that day but know @CAPS5 thirteen and I real don’t care anymore but I would still love to hear about your step to someday.

I was at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride that I really wanted to go on I was a huge line! It was like a big line of domminus. I do not like waiting in big lines. Like most kids, I dont wine and fuss about waiting. In my head I’m thinking when I whould get to go on the ride. I dont scream and shout though, I just try to stand still and wait. The second go on. tic tac tic tac. Just waiting for the line to get shorter and smaller. Minutes later it was finnaly my turn to go on the rollercoaster I was so exited! I went on the ride, it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute! that line that I had to wait in was like an hour. Well on well. That line was worth it.

On @DATE1 me and my two friends were all laughing out but then I had rememberd that in @NUM1 min I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside and my friends were being so patient. They didn’t leave me and so I hurried as fast as I could so I didnt keep them waiting. After I got done we went back up to the park and swang on the swing. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home. That was my @DATE1. It was a fun one.

If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1, that’s a different story. I’ll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldn’t be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldn’t get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didn’t help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if I’m very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait.

This is a story about a time when I was being patient waiting for a plain in an airport. We were on ar way to @LOCATION1 and we had to take two plains to get there. When we got off the plain to the second airport we went to go see what time our second flights comes in. when we found out the time for the second flight we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in. my mom told me I had to be patient but I am not good at being patient. To get things off my mind we decided to eat. When I was done eating. I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed and it was annoying me. So I started to play my ds. Before I knew it we only had one hour left so playing my ds distracted me. I got impatient real fast, so that’s when my sister and I started goofing around. All of a sudden our plain arrives I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learnt to be patient.

There have been times where I had to be patient. This one time I went to the dentist we got there and we sat down. Let me tell you something I hate the dentist. So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you don’t have to wait as long. That means you can get and go. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview. One good thing patience can get you to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if your all prep you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect. Its like treating things like dirt. Patience is sort of like table manners, nice and proffessional. If I were you go patient it leads you to a good future.

Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out. Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience.

Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just don’t have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was. I sat next to all my friends and the all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just alittle bit to much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didn’t know what he was doing. @CAPS2 one actually knew that he and I were friends. After I went up to see what number I was I saw that I was the first one to speak. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me. I soon started to speak about lady @PERSON1 @CAPS1 loved my speech! After we my friend, @ORGANIZATION1 and I were done with our speeches we both sat next to eachother and were talking a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, “@CAPS2 way why would I be friends with him?” then @CAPS1 laughed. We both looked at eachother, in a bad way. After a few days we won’t talking to each other since @CAPS1 was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But ofcourse, @ORGANIZATION1 wasn’t patient at all. He was eager to tell @CAPS1 that me and him were friends but we couldn’t tell anyone because to them were both different, but the truth is that we’re both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basket ball, music and talking like @NUM1. Haha! Soon @CAPS1 found out. @ORGANIZATION1 had gone and told @CAPS1 that we were friends. Turns out @CAPS2 one laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ORGANIZATION1 had @CAPS2 patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and @ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, @CAPS3 having patience is a good thing but sometimes people can’t have patience when they want to become friends.

A time when I was patient was when me and my cousin family went @LOCATION1 and my sister was sick. Me and my other sister sat on my car. For about two and a half hours. My sister was getting mad but I just sat there patiently. My mom and sister were in the doctors office for the longest time! my sister ended up going to the doctors office three times. But I was very patient, when she wasn’t at the doctor, all she wanted to do was lay down so we barely gat to do any fun stuff. By the end of the trip she was feeling better so my mom took us to do something fun. That was a time when I was patient.

Being patient is waiting your turn in line and @CAPS3 cuting you should wait because cuting in line is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and  @CAPS1 disrespectful. and you will have no friends. Being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being respectful when you don’t wait your turn. @CAPS1 when you to do something which your mom and dad are speaking to another adult @CAPS1 rouged to rush things when other people don’t want to do something with you. Or nagging to leave somewhere like a aunts or uncles house. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when you don’t wait. Be respectful and wait it’s a better way to make friends. And if someone is @CAPS3 being respectful to you tell them to be. And then walk away and say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to @CAPS3 wait and be patient. Grrr.

I felt a thrill in my body. We were @NUM1 seconds from the opening of @ORGANIZATION1. I had to wait @NUM2 minutes to go on space mountain. I wish I could’ve cut all the people in line but I knew I had to wait. When I got off I knew that it was so worth it. A the end of the day I beged to go on one more ride. Again I had to wait @NUM3 minutes to go on. The ride showed boring history of @CAPS1. Then at the end it gave us a screen and we picked the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it.

Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousin’s third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what they’re doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly. I learned an important lesson from my cousin’s birthday party – babysitting requires a lot of patience!

“@CAPS1!!” I had another math home work assignment due tomorrow and I was tired of math already. Every day my fourth grade teacher would give us math home work that was really long and hard. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me. Every day I would come home sit down at the table and take my time, and doing work. @NUM1 problems a day was hard for a fourth grader. Whenever math started I would get out my homework and wait to check it. I never did terrible. @CAPS2 I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also challenging. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us as easy lesson and I felt confident I could finish it at school. I came to a hard problem every once in a wile and I would stress out. But I remembered what my mom said, “be patient and stay calm,” @CAPS2 I did. I was patient and I worked through the problem. Now to this day I remember to be patient. I also remember what we will have to live with being patient all our lives. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out.

So he waited for @NUM1 minutes for the experiment to get done. Then they left, it was a three hour drive, and his favorite show was on, he taped it. He was being patient, then they got there. He looked for the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man for @NUM2 minutes, could @PERSON1 be lieing to him, he was being so patient that he was getting tired, then feel asleep, and woke up and guese who it was.” The @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man,remember me “@CAPS2 said the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 dude man, @PERSON1 watched and laughed, @CAPS2 threw a bonney ball into the @CAPS9-@CAPS10, @DATE2, no more @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man. @CAPS2 was patient he was patient for more than @NUM3 hours to get to watch itchy and almost @DATE2 @DATE1 to get back at the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man.

Usually I have very little patience (and yes I do know that patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospitle room with any dad to spend time with my mom, @CAPS1 was very boring, but somehow I managed to go the whole day (up to where my dad finally let me watch @CAPS2.V. in the room) without being baerd to tears.

A time when I was patience. I was going school shoping. There were maybe over a hundred people in the store @PERSON1. It was like a duster of pebles in the sand. You could barly go down. The illes. It was like a whole mall in one little store. Some people would leave because how many people where in there. Then even more would come. It was me, @CAPS1 mom, and @CAPS1 dad. We started stuff out. We got in line behind maybe @NUM1 people or more. @CAPS1 mom was ready to explode. So @TIME1 only @TIME1 people had gone. @CAPS1 mom almost fell asleep I was just standing there waiting. But @CAPS1 armys hurted and @CAPS1 back herted. She was so ready to get out of that store. @CAPS1 dad was reading a magizene while he was waiting.  Espn news to be exact. These were only a few people infront of use. I was happy that we could finally get @CAPS1 clothes. We get up to by @CAPS1 clothes and a cash register braekes. The lady said it will take a hour or two so @CAPS1 mom starts to complain.

I was patinent when we were on the bus, we had just arrived at school the kids were loud and nociy in the day. Were a lot to get off the bus when someone jumped in front of ??? then I fell back into my seat, the was about @NUM1 - @DATE1 kids getting off the bus. So I waited for all the kids to pass me then I got up and walked down the  alie to the door, then the bus driver said" thanks for waiting". Then I left
<START>

It was @DATE1, @CAPS1 my friends were talking about how cool xbox was. They were saying how if you get xbox live then you can play with people around the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to come out, that was called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I had searched it up online. And it was voted to be a ranking of @NUM2 stars. Now thats a good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both and always say will see. After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why don’t you wait till @CAPS6. And once I went to my dad’s house he said @CAPS6 is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it can’t I just get it now. My dad said no, so then after that I had waited @NUM1 months thinking could he have his answer or maybe he changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my mom’s house and asked her she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I won’t get it. And so @CAPS6 came and for my last present from my mom and my dad I had gotten an xbox with my favorite game I was sooo happy. And know I know if you have pacience and you wait long enough you’ll get what you want.

Patience is usually good or bad for me. Here are a few reasons why patience can be hard or stresful. If you are waiting to get a shot or life threat results. A way to avoid normal patience like being board is to get some notes or school work to do or an ipod. Patience is everywere. For example carrides, birthday parties, vacation commercial, school being over, restaurants, holidays or whenever you say “I cannot wait,” and etc. to sam up a few ways about patience in my way of description.

A time when I was patient was when I was waiting at the dentist for my brother. My brother name is @CAPS1 and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully I had my @CAPS3 so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later I went to the bathroom. When I got out a nurse told me to come with her, she lead me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor didn’t even start yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days the doctor finally showed up. After a hour or so the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually funny. Finally we left and I didn’t lose my patience.

When you hear the word patience what do you think of. I think about a person standing in line at a store when theres @NUM1 people standing in front of you. In @NUM2 grade my sister and I played the patient game. It was about who could go the longest without food and all you could drink is water and the winner gets a whole box of dunkin doughnuts to themselves. Day @NUM3 I had about @NUM4 bottles of water but my sister was still hanging in there. Day @NUM5 I had about @NUM6 bottles of water and all day my stomach groaned some with my sister. Day @NUM7 all the groaning and the growling my sister was hanging and so ??? in was ??? their  I drink water. Day @NUM8 I snapped and had so much food my whole fontry was gone, my sister @CAPS1 was cheering and she said “don’t worry ill let you have one of my @NUM9 choclate doughnuts” and she kept her word. In my opinion that was patience.

When they got here I was at the airport waiting .When I saw my cousin she said “everyone was so patient but me!” I expected the exact oposite but, no!

Patience someone was patient with me when I did not understand something. Someone was a teacher. The teacher did not complain about helping me. Along with the students in the room. When the teacher was helping me they sat and quietly did there work. The teacher understand that I did not understand @CAPS1 to do the work. It was during math. We were tarning about positive and negitive  intergers. My question was, ''@CAPS1 do you order them from last to greatess''. She replied , ''I asy would you like me to show you?'' I said , ''@CAPS2 please''. So for about @NUM1 minutes she helped me. In that time my whole class sat and did there work. That is one time when people were patient with me.

Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4’s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!

When im patient is mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be patient to wait for deer. They don't always come sometimes it could just be a fawn. Other  times it can be does. put when you see a buck ???is everything you first have to wait for it to come in close enough for a shot. When it does you have to wait to bring up your gun. Then you have to wait for a shot. If you get it you be patient and wait for it to die. If you cdnt find it right away dont give up. That is when I was patient.

One time my volleyball team went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was one of the last people off our bus which means I was one of the last to order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered. I talked to my friends as they waited too. Next I figured out, what I was going to eat, (@CAPS1 cheese, burger, @CAPS2 fry, and a large drink). “@CAPS3 @CAPS4, @CAPS3 @CAPS4” as I watched the clock my eyes got droppy “@CAPS7, @NUM1” the lady said. “@CAPS8 @MONTH1 I take your order,” she said. I told her what I wanted and she put it on her register and I began to wait. A couple minutes later I got my order. Finally after being patient I got my food.

What is patient? Being patient means to wait for something that @MONTH1 take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is your waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say "stop your being patient. Before you be rude and keep begging for what you want think of other people, understand why it might have longer then you want and be patient.

There is time in everyones life were they have to be patient. The time I was patient was when I was helping my brother learn how to tye his shoes. I know this sounds like an easy task but it really isn’t. Time after time again my brother attempted to tye his shoes but could never do it. So I told him to go get one of his shoes and I will teach him. When we got started I thought this would be over in about five minutes but no! He could not make the bunny ears. So we tried and tried again. He would get so close to tying the knot and then he would get so excited he would pull the knot as hard as he could and the laces would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use his shoes with straps but no, he was determined to tye his shoes. After about an hour of tying he finally got it! He didnt tye them perfectly but it was good enough to keep them tyed I said good job and started to walk to the kitchen. When he asked about the double knot. So of course I walk over and tell him just cross the two bunny ears and loop around but he didnt get it. I had to have shown him a billion times how to do it! But he still didn’t get it. We hit the half hour ??? for the double ??? and I went in the kitchen for a juice box. When it came back my brother had a smile on from cheek to cheek and held up his shoe proudley.

A momma bird was laying eggs. She layed @NUM1 butiful, blue, perfect eggs. Days went by, and the eggs did not hatch. The momma bird got upset. She talked to papa bird, and he said, "@CAPS1 be patient". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the @NUM2 oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, "@CAPS2 can't I fly yet" and momma said," @CAPS1 be patient."

I was @CAPS1 excited to get my first ipad. But, there was a very long line. @CAPS1, my mom kept on telling he to be patient. @CAPS1, I just stand there quietly. Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said “what kind do you want?” @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all. Then my said “stop listing to that music” @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched tv and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That is the time I was being patient.

When I was patient, we were onone way to @CAPS1 point: with @LOCATION1 her mom and dad and her brother and I. We were driving to go there. It took us @NUM1 hours to get there. @LOCATION1 and I were very patient we wated and waited to get there we were soo exited. When we got there, we all waited in line to ride a hole bunch of rollercoaster. We all waited in line about @NUM2 hours for every ride it was extra buisy that day. @LOCATION1 and I wanted to ride the tallest rollercoaster. It was called the @CAPS2 the @CAPS2 was @NUM1 @NUM4 it was the tallest rollercoster. I had ever been on and all the other people that came too. To get on that ride it was a @NUM5 hour wait it was exosting and we had to be very patient. But when we got to the front it was worth the wait!

Click,’ “ok, cool grandma thanks.”  I say “your welcome.” @CAPS1 says. “When will they be here” I say. “I don’t know.” @CAPS2 you don’t know what @CAPS3 talking about, which you probably don’t, @CAPS3 talking about my shoes I just ordered online. There called @CAPS4. And boy was I goin crazy over these things. I waited for @NUM1 days and every day I would ask my mom, are they here yet, are they here yet, but every time l did, they weren’t there. I was starting to get mad. So finally l rode my bike around to get it off my mind and I see a @ORGANIZATION1 truck and I thaught on yes hes probably going to my house with my shoes, so I raced home and waited, and waited but still no shoes. So the next day l look up online were my shoes were, and it said @PERSON1. MI. I was flipping out that meant they were coming. So again @CAPS3 wating, and waiting and my mom decided we go somewhere. So l went in the car to leave, and I thaught l heard the truck, but nope so we finally arive back at my house and l looked to the left and yup! there they were sitting on my front ?? in a rough brown box. I run over pick it up and dash inside tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man. I try them on (@CAPS6) they are awesome. I thank my grandma and all my patients flew away. I felt so happy.

A time that I had to be patient was at cedar point in @LOCATION1. My @CAPS1, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at cedar point. My @CAPS1’s stayed at the motorhome while my @CAPS1, my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but @NUM1 or @NUM2 of the roller coasters, my @CAPS1 by the way, am not really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my @CAPS1 were going to back to the moterhome, but I wanted to go on just on??? before heading back, so I asked if could ask she said yes. I told my @CAPS1 that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever. I have @CAPS2, so as you could imagine, I could hardly stand still, I had to try very hard but eventraully I got on the ride, and then it was good again. The ride by the way was extremely amazing.

@PERSON1. I was in love with the guy! I swear middle school @CAPS1 when you have to be the most patient out of all the time in your life! Seconds pass by like hours your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. @DATE2 @CAPS1 the girl’s choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. “@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.” I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to @CAPS3 @PERSON3 (who @CAPS1 @PERSON1’s friend) to @CAPS3 @CAPS2, (@PERSON1’s better friend) to @CAPS3 @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 but, now he knows, and now it’s @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience @CAPS1 my essence I remind myself don’t be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasn’t because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today @CAPS1 @DATE2 and the dance @CAPS1 tonight. At my locker, which @CAPS1 four and a doorway down from @PERSON1’s I have a note taped to it. It reads “@CAPS3 me your phone number and I’ll call you for the @NUM1.”. Gosh! Boys are so confusing I @CAPS3 him my number and wait by the phone. I think he’s testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and @CAPS3 me it would be worth it in the end. The phone didn’t ring for what seemed like an eternity, so when it finally did I thought I was imagining it.’ When I answered all my patience paid off! He said one word. Yes!

Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you”@CAPS1 be patient? Recently @CAPS2 been patient. My family got a new microwave and its too big for our counter so we had to put it above our stove. Well there wasn’t enough space above the stove so my parents decided to remadle the whole kitchen. My step mom took everything out of the kichen and put it all over dinning room, and now we can barely walk in the dinning room .Lately my family has been eating in our living room. (@CAPS3) I really don’t like eating in our living room it @CAPS1 seems so gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch. So that’s a good thing. Idon’t know how much longer I can keep up with this. But @CAPS2 @CAPS1 got to be patient. Finally now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that my step mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away and how we are back to normal. After being patient it really pays off. Now you know to always be patient.

It was a nice warm sunny @DATE1 day!!! We decided we could go pick up every one from my dads house and go to the genesee county farm. We got to my dads house and pick up my step brother, step sister, real brother, step mom, and my dad. We start heading to the genesee county farm. We started walking around waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it was going to rain that would be a waist of money. We walk up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wrist bands if it starts raining. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile the barn starts flooding. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finaly it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying on the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate toco bell and burger tong.

One day my grandfather and I went fishing my grandfather always says it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing zone I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, “that will take far ever just catch some fish.” I told him that was going to catch a turtle and that was final. When something pulling at my fishing rod I taint to pull it in and what pulled my line was a small white bass. The next thing that pulled on my fishing rod was a big white bass. I was getting angry because there were no turtles bitting my line. The very next thing that tugged at my line was a @NUM1 inch white bass it was the biggest fish I ever caught before but it weren’t a turtle. After I caught that fish I said it’s time for a break time. I was eating a sandwich and my grandpa was jacking around and catching fish. At the time I was finshing my sandwich and my fishing rod was pulling.  I had to grab my fishing rod and ??? in my fish but it weren’t a fish it was a baby turtle.

In @CAPS1 middle school, in @PERSON2's dirty and muddy science classroom, a boy named @CAPS2 and another named @CAPS3 were cleaning the mess @CAPS7 made earlier, from their mudball fight. For years, @PERSON2 was trying to @CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to @CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to figure out what could calm them down. @CAPS7 DO have @CAPS4 though…  @CAPS5 @PERSON2. Often she wondered what went though their minds when @CAPS7 got angry. When teaching them science, @CAPS7 never understood. When @CAPS7 did wrong things, @CAPS7 didn't know it was wrong. @CAPS7 progressed @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 in her class, understanding little. But it was as the principal said, "@CAPS6 patient, @PERSON1; @CAPS7 will learn eventually." @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 as the months passed, @PERSON1 believed her husband more and more. By being patient with them and not getting angry at them when @CAPS7 did something wrong, their grades started picking up soon, by the end of the year, @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 were @CAPS11- plus students. @CAPS7 had passed @PERSON1's class. On the last day of school, @PERSON1 went to her husbands office. She @CAPS12 him that his advice worked and that he was a great principal. All @PERSON3 replied was " @CAPS12 you so!"

I am patient. Even though I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was @NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dad’s house. She forgot that he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I @MONTH1 add has never changed, even @NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would @CAPS1 have touched it. But I did. I was only @NUM1! I don’t really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because it’s implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun??
<START>

Being patient is very difaclut. I was a the store with my mom, and of course @CAPS1 was taching forever. “come on mom lets go do we really need this stuff” @CAPS1 just continued shoping. Grrr I was so angry. I almost thought about throughing a fit. Finally, we were in line. As we got into the car my mom looked at me and said give me your phone. “@CAPS2 why”? The way you ackted in that store was horibal now I no I will alway be patient with my mom.
<START>

Every year I go to my dads. He lives in @LOCATION1 so we stop ta the border. The border takes @CAPS1! So my family has to be patient, with them. On our way @LOCATION1 one time the border was packed. Our family had to be patient, or there were going to be some argueing. With four kids it is bound to happen. After an hour every ones patients were running low, so my dad kept repeating keep patient, keep patient over and over. We finnaly past the boarder everyone cheerd. So keeping patience is not the easyiest thing to do. We all need to learn just a little more about how to keep it.
<START>

Are you a patient person? Well I’m not! Well, I can be patient I just won’t like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since they’re kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. it’s hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didn’t want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is.

“@CAPS1” The bell had finally rang and it was time for lunch. It felt like math class would never end. I rushed to lunch without even stopping at my locker. When I got there, there was a line for lunch that seemed like it stretched for a mile. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I got in the huge line. I stood there and waited. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day, so I justed waited. Several minutes later, I was near the front of the line. All of the sudden, seven girls just cutted in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though that made me angry, I didn’t complain and stayed patient. I soon got my lunch. In conclusion, that was the time I was patient. I was understanding and did not complain.
<START>

During the @DATE1 between forth and fifth grade, my family and I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1! @CAPS4 of the rides had lines, but none of them had line as long and the @CAPS2  @CAPS3. The line was huge! As my brothers, their best friend and I approached the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS5 thought @CAPS5 would never get on. My dad said to just wait, but @CAPS5 didn’t see the point. When @CAPS5 got about half way, one of the employees shouted, “@NUM1 more minutes!” and @CAPS5 @CAPS4 became more excited. Eventually, @CAPS5 made to the front of the line! @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had to do was wait for the current trial was over! But then, the speaker came on, “@CAPS4 rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in and @CAPS5 must because of safety issues.” @CAPS5 had @CAPS4 considered leaving, but had a feeling @CAPS5 shouldn’t. @CAPS5 talked with some other kids @CAPS5 met in line. @CAPS5 played games like rocks, paper, scissors while @CAPS5 waited under the pavillion above the line. Once the storm rolled away, they allowed us on! The ride was a thrill! I had wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and a thankyou from my dad  for keeping us in line.

The time I was patient as when I was getting my dog. I had gone to a jazz festival with my mom, my sister, and her friend. We were walking past a last chance rescue and we went to see the puppies. My mom didn’t want another dog but when she saw our future dog boxter she gave in. he has grey fur with some black spots and and a black line running down his fore. At the center of the ???. He was a grown short hair blue healer mix. We asked the lady if we could get him but she said they are going in sport and we could buy him there. We got in the car and ??? to ???. we signed the forms and played with him in the store. But ??? down town with him on the sosh and we got some ice cream and went home.

A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vaction to @CAPS1. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctors office but there wasn’t one around but we found an ergent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok I’ll be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really unpatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vaction. That’s a time where I was patient.

They tried to get him to stand up but @CAPS11 wouldn't. @PERSON1 and I were wating in the house trying to wait and see if @CAPS11 was going to live. @PERSON1 decided that she was going to help out with her hourse. They carried the table with @PERSON3 on it to @CAPS8 his mom. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she set the table down. And @CAPS8 kicks @PERSON1 to the tree. The next day @PERSON2 and I were putting a tent up in the back yard. So the horses could cool down. Nana called the vet to see @CAPS1 they could do. They got their @NUM1 minutes later they said that they will stich him up. And see @CAPS1 else they could do. They stitched him up for three hours. They said to watch him and see if any wounds would come out of their stitches. They also said they were going to check up on him the folowing @DATE2. That @DATE2 came and they took him to the statules and took care of him for a while @CAPS11 eventuly got belter. That's how I showed patince in the @DATE1.

There has been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will intrest you most. Finaly we get to go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is this big indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I have been wanting to go here for years. When we get there my first thought is “paradise” little did I know that there was the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides they were for every thing. In two days of fun it is already our last day at @CAPS1. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. my mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave “paradise”. We left around @NUM2 thinking we would be home by about @NUM3. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been @NUM4 but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly. I asked my mum when we were going to get home she said just be patient. So I just went along with it and sucked it up.” @CAPS3 we are home”. I say running inside. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock it was @NUM5. @NUM6 longer then we thought. But I had to go to bed right then (dans it no video games). That is a time I displayed patcience.

I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life.

I have been patiencent a lot of times but right now me and my friends are saving up to meet @PERSON1! Thats alot of patience just for one ticket its @MONEY1! So just imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! It’s hard being patience it exspecially when your are going to meet a celebirtly that you have the hugest crush on! I have been patiencent a lot during this process of saving up money. No matter how hard its going to be I can do it with patience. My friends and have been patiencent and still are. I meant could you stay patiencent if you were goning to meet your favorite celebirty that you love? Well it’s not that easy first off it takes a lot of patience to do chores and take care of your animals, plus count how much money you have. And when people borrow your money that really sets you back. But like said no matter what we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus tat to meet him and we are going to be patiencent the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons and you get to see and learn how to become patiencent. Overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life.

I had a friend well she is @CAPS4 best friend and we know each other from @NUM1 grade then in @NUM2 grade she said she said she has to move to @LOCATION1. So she moved and she would call me all the like two time a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until this one day came she called and @NUM3 was kind of busy because there were people over are house. One of @CAPS4 mom friend calls me and I told  @CAPS1 (@CAPS4 best  friend) hold on someone is calling me she said okay so I left the phone on @CAPS4 bed while she  was still o the phone.

After that @CAPS4 mom said go take out the trash so I went and put on @CAPS4 scarf and took at the trash out the like @NUM4 mins I had her waiting.

Have you ever been patient? I know it is hard for me to be patient! I usually am not patient because I really like things done right then and there, I don’t really like to wait. I can be patient! I can be patient when I am waiting short periods of time. Usually I like to rush, not on my work, but socially, I rush! Being patient means to wait, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at @TIME1 and it is @NUM1, you have to wait for a long time! Usually the time seems to go slow! Patience is a quality that is important. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient. You should too!

Last year, @DATE1 it was my birthday, so I told my @CAPS1 what I wanted for my @DATE3 and out of everything I said “@CAPS1 I want a @CAPS2” (@CAPS3 station @CAPS4). So the @DATE2 we go out at three in the morning to get my @ORGANIZATION1 and we were at best buy. So we walked up to the store and we opened the door and there had to be over @DATE4 people in the store. So we walk over to the game. I she and their was two text and their was five people in the section so we grabed one of the two. But when we got in line half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line. We got home at @TIME1. This story is not about what I wanted its about patience. So I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my @CAPS2, werever you go use patience you will get thought about and treated nicer than you expect.

I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: @CAPS1. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he should’ve realized I wouldn’t just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, I’d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn’t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That’s how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @CAPS1, and him.

It was the @DATE1 and I, @PERSON1, had applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I had applied in @DATE2 and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION2. From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day.  Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself "@CAPS2 is the day it has to be." I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says "@CAPS4 is that day." Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience.
<START>

A time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called x-men @CAPS3 wolver in and my mom said I had to what until @CAPS1 came strolling down the road. I can understand why she said that because we were a lttle shorf on cash at that time so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer. After a few week had past I forgot all about the game then on @CAPS1 day my sister and I got down stairs so fast then when we were oozning gifts I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go grab it and I opened it and it was it x-men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and tow other games that I wanted offer that I go up to my room grab my @CAPS5 and headphones pop in x-me @CAPS3 and played it all day long

When my friend and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was very busy. We dint have to wait a long time , @CAPS1 my ride we ??? to wait a longtime  to get on @CAPS1 my friend  was very patiente and I was not. I kept complaining on how long it took. @CAPS1 eventually we got on the ride and had a blast. It was horrible waiting, @CAPS1 it was worth it because the ride was the @ORGANIZATION2. It's the best ride in the whole wide world.

To write about a time I was patient is hard for me to do so since I am not a patient person, but I am going to try. Three days before the trip to cedar point can not wait for it to be here. I did try to make it rush by, but it didn’t work. I had been off of school now for @NUM1 weeks and I had did everything I wanted to do. When me my mom, sister and friends go we always have a lot of fun (of corce). Every night since , I have known we are going to cedar point I would sit there and think one day when many kids would ask and complain to there mom saying, “ can’t it come anymore,” but me never, not one I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited did my chores, packed and watched tv. Trust me it was very long, very boring and is itching at me to complain but I didn’t. I took a deep breath every time, this would happen to me. And say only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to cedar point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and do while waiting for cedar point to come along. This is what patient is to me, and in my life. This is also a time in my life when I was patient.

Being pactient. Well when I have a baby cousin coming from @LOCATION1 and she was adopted from call for in a so I have never sean her befor I have only seen her in the hillper and photoes.

It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME3. The sun was just coming up as I got into my box blind. It had snowed the @TIME1 but it was only @DATE1. Then again I was in the upper penisaala of @LOCATION1. I was hunting for a monster ten point with my brand new @NUM1 and @TIME2 gun could kill a dear @NUM2 yards. I have been sitting for an hour but it felt like a day. I’ve only seen a squarile and he was fun to watch in all but not the rush you get when you see a deer. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I was looking in the direction the sound was coming. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” gun up @TIME2 time my adrenilen hicking in. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I see move ment put my scope on it and I see it. It’s a it’s a grouse? I glowered the gun calmed down and watched it eat some corn. It was @NUM3. time for lunch and all I had was a turkey sandwhich, a apple, and a bottle of water. I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I  saw a brown figure move. I grabed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So picture @TIME2 a guy with all come on. An apple in his mouth, and look in a scope. As I looked  I realized it was him the big @NUM4. Massive horns, a big body and he was proble five maby six years old. I put my crosshairs just be hind the shoulder and I diehed the safety off. Slowly pulled the trigger. My mind a blur and “@CAPS4!” perfect shot. Later @TIME2 I found him and he was big @NUM5. I got him mounted and that’s were he is now.

I was patience when I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hours just to ride ???. Then I got on it took off @NUM2 miles pa hour. I was stuck to it for five minutes then it went down ??? @NUM2 miles pa hour. I got off and rode it miles cum force and I was faced to it. The drop is ??? . The ride was @NUM1 minutes long ??? @NUM5 people. I went on the powa hour it was sence. My ??? was the reply it was fun to. I came home as it was in the @TIME1. I woke up and ate breakfast. The whole time is waied patience in everyone.
<START>

The time when I was patient I was about @NUM1 because I was in @NUM2 grade im @NUM3 now but back to what I was sayin, I was sayin that I was seven in the @NUM2 grade and I was standing in the lunch line and these kids just kept on cuttin me in line jus for some lunch and I just sat there, being patient and myself. but I just stood there so when we did something else I was patient when we got up there I was ok it was ok ‘cause I still got to eat.

One day when I was patient is when I was waiting was waiting @CAPS1 @NUM1 to come out of game stop. One day til  @CAPS1 @NUM1 come out I kept looking at the signs of the game and I said “@CAPS2 must be a good game”. So instead of waiting at game stop I went home and played @ORGANIZATION1 football @NUM3 on my xbox @NUM4 then I got tired , tired and more tired so I fell aslteep on my pep game chair  till the morning. My older brother woke up and said “lets go to gamestop to get @CAPS1”. So we went to game stop and waited in a long line for like an hour and thirty minutes til in was  are turn to buy @CAPS1 it  cost like @MONEY2. I had @MONEY3 my brother had @MONEY1 he did’nt wanna put no money in for the game and I said “I’ll pay @MONEY3 and you will @MONEY1. So we brought the game and played it tell we beat it.
<START>

Here is a way that I had to be patient, and we all know that??? has to be patient with others. ??? Yes, it was my birthday. I wasn’t thinking of my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no I was thinking of getting the money, first present no money. Second present, yes, there was money. And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldn’t wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldn’t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, if its along time, but its also a good thing to do because it pays with every time.

Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every mustle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crows. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And than I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stoped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn’t just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening.

This a story about a time when I was patient. It was the @NUM1 @DATE1  we were on the plane about to go on a cruise, when we got to the ship I was so excited I was  thinking how much fun I was gonna have, think what my room would look like, and going to all these cool new places. So we got on the dock and there wa a line and I was patient an waited to get on, @CAPS1 there was another line to check your passport, so I was patient and waited. @CAPS1 there was another sticken line. It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again and just stood there for a little bit and it was done, but wait you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines I stood there on my iPod listening to music. They my dad said “ready”, I said ready for what another line he said “no” to look at your “room and relax .“ I was so excited. Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing. But the bath room was a little small but it was great. I was so happy to final done with the lines no more! That is a time when I was patient.
<START>

One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young ones playing and laughing carelessly. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird o. not to be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient.
<START>

One @CAPS1, I was very patient when our flight got @CAPS2. We were going to @LOCATION1 that @CAPS1 when all of a sudden the @CAPS2 sign came up on the @CAPS5. I was kind a sud but I said I had to be patient! Our flight was ??????& @CAPS14. So when we were waiting we did a lot of things! First we went to ear in the food court! We delceced to go to chile's. we also had to wait for our food! Got some good hach's & they were very good! Then we went to the @CAPS6 @CAPS7! At the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 I got @NUM1 key chains for my friends! Then I got myself @NUM2 magizens & a reading @CAPS10! I also get some @CAPS11 @CAPS12! They were very good! Next we just took a little walk around the @CAPS13! Then we went and sat down & relaxed for couple @CAPS14. Then I fell asleep! when woke up we were just about @CAPS15 to board! I was very @CAPS16 to finally get to @LOCATION1 & enjoy all of the @CAPS17 weather! I learned that being patient really does matter! That was the Time I was really patient

Being patient! Patience is a good learning skill. The three step to being patient, being quiet, not complaining, and waiting a while if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with @PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still could. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When l was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the doer to come closer. @PERSON1 loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran of. Purted shot! We got out of the shead and searched for a blood trial. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was wroth it. The right way to be patient, shuting your mouth, not wining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient. Being patient
<START>

Being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a @DATE1 and my mom woked me up at @NUM1 she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didn’t know that I was going to have to be paitent the whole day. First on our way to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about @NUM2 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum I’m ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life.
<START>

At one @CAPS2 in left you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient.
<START>

I remember one time I was impatient, it was when my called and said she was go send me @NUM1$. @CAPS1 I asked her when she was to send it and she said @DATE3. Today was @DATE4 so that mean I had to @NUM2 days. @CAPS1 the next day had cameup  and the ???  truck came by and I thought I had mony but it wasn’t @DATE3 yet, @CAPS1 I said, “@CAPS2.” @DATE1 came, I was still waiting so I tried going to the day can past by “ @CAPS3 it! So @CAPS1 it was @DATE2 they had my favorite game on sale “The bully” the case had a yellow sticker that @NUM3 and no tax at all,@CAPS1 I was mad and @CAPS4 went home. My dad woke me up and said “its @DATE3 “ I @CAPS1 I rose up ate breakfast @CAPS1 check the mail, @CAPS1 it bills, bills,bills and “ my money” my sent we an ???. At last I said I have money, so I bought some icecream @CAPS1 I bought my favorite game “bully”. “that’s the time when I was patient.

Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and being toterant is what makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to them team, you’re time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game the carman – @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing not fouled (I didn’t even see it, truth be told I’m not even sure if it happen but you can’t argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! I’m surprised her shot wasn’t took. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didn’t say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) she didn’t make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. I’m just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there is didn’t a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, but down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite! Nobody‘s perfect, you’ll have to wait and see who will score the next point!
<START>

It was my first game. I was pumped ready to go in, coach yelled big guy and I was by his side. Then he said next play you re going in. Ther the assistant said no I wasn’t aloud to. The whole time I didn’t complain. I never said one word to anyone. I helped other people. It was still fun. The whole time at least I didn’t complain and make it worth for everyone else. The whole time I was on the side lines. Never went in not ounce. I was very patient. Not to say I wasn’t mad. At least I got some exercise standing there. The whole time I suported my team mates. I encouraged. I help in any way shape or form. I listend to them complain. But I did give suport. There I was so mad I could have killed. I was ready but my coach said no. It has my time to shine. That one stupid word stood in my way no. But at least I learned something.

Hunting when you are turkey hunting you need to be extremly still and quiets did you have to have a lot of patience. If you move even a musle all the turkeys will run away. Some times you will be sitting for hours and hours just waiting on the one shot. I remember when I was  hunting with my dad @CAPS1 sitting under a tree fro probablee three hours and finally a turkey came, unfortunutly just about when I had a shot my dad scared them all away but I still had the patience to stay out there for another @NUM1 hours. That is my example of patience.

In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time.
<START>

Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, more months passed and i still hadn’t heard from my uncle. I began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my haad A little it’s been almost a year! Then on @DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion.Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldn’t have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story I want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. The @CAPS3.

You will say that you are board very fast. Most people are cause when you get out in the woods theres nothing you can do except watch and waist if you make one noise you will see nothing your whole hunt. Hunting is all about patients but it is a great reward when that doe, buck or whatever you’re hunting is rite in your sight. There are sometimes that I have been impatient and there’s times that I have been patient when I was younger I was very important I would got up and walk around but when I got older I got more patient like when. I got my first deer it was an eight point. Hunting @MONTH1 take patients but I like it and its fun.

One time I was patient was when I had to get some @CAPS1 done and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my @CAPS1. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited, I decided to watch an episode of spongebob while I waited. As the episode ended I went back to the computer. She still wasn’t done! So I made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate @NUM1... and so on I got to @NUM2 and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasn’t. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2 got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing. I got out. I went upstairs to change. I came downstairs and surprisingly my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my @CAPS1. This took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait so long.

one time I was in  patient. We was an are way to see the point. The had family was with us. We all was in @NUM1 car and vans. I was like and the van @NUM2 and the car and @NUM3 in the car.  It was like a @NUM3 hour drive. I was in the car with my mom and @NUM1 sister. We was and takere for like a hour. First I was on the fane then I was just having a family talk bye like an hour I was so in patient. And all I could here was my mom like be patient we gone get there. I’m like no no I want to be there @CAPS1. She like we got all day. Then we stop to get something to eat. Then we was there.

One time I had to use patience when we were driving to @CAPS1. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (@NUM1 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @NUM4 ocklock @CAPS2 time and,in @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am.  I was very tired of being patient, I’m not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!

Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who “claims” to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isn’t up yet.

When I was @NUM1 yrs old my mom started making my @DATE1 present. She was going to make a blanket. Sadly she didn’t find the blanket.I have to be patient. I had  and it wasn’t done, then ???.

One time when I was patient was when I was fishing. We where fishing on a cold night and no fish where bighting,. I was just @CAPS1 ther being patient caling sun flower  seeds. My dad was getting mad and I was still @CAPS1 listning  to the backeasard  celtcs  games.  We where only catching little fish that night nuthing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didn’t have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample.

When I was patient I was sitting at a restront. And I ordered my drink and mike was the first one. Then when we got our food they said it will take about five more minutes so I sat there it was fifteen minutes later when she came back and made the wrong food so I was losing my patient’s. so then I just relaxed. She came back with my meal thes time it was. The right one so I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast so when I was done they gave me a free descont because of the mixup they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such great patient`s I had. And thats when I was very patient.

We were going to @CAPS1. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting the to ride the skyline. After we ate, me my cousins and my??? headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole??? of cedar point. “im so excited” said one of my sisters. “yaa me too!” said the the other. We were walking towards it. It took really long. When we saw the line we heaked! “this will take so long” said my sister. I was so surprised my @NUM1-year- ol cousin her??? ???. “wow it look really high” said my cousin. “@CAPS2’t, worry we have @CAPS3 with us. She’ll take care of us” said my younger sister. Finally it was our turn. There were @NUM1 small kids behind us. Wanting to go on so badly. “why @CAPS2’t you go ahead” said my cousin. I was shocked my cousin had so much patience. Usually she had start wanting to go first for everything! I was so proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. I hope we come back again!

Patience is a hard thing to have, but there is rewards to having it. I had a teacher that no one could remember to gave us our report card in band class. So after a few weeks I made a bet with him that if he didn’t bring us our report card the next day he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally. It was the end of the year. And he still didn’t have them. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said?? yes are only suppose to give me and  he told me “ the second one is ? being to patient.”

Patience is a valuable thing. Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do @CAPS1 practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It take patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn’t when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting.

The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom don’t have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you don’t have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients! And rember pacents is the key thing to sucsses!

Said the kid. Then a few minst later a girl named @PERSON4 (that @PERSON2  likes) was going to the way backof the line but @PERSON2 said she could cut in front of him. So she did.

Last @DATE1, while I was up at my families within my seep dad, taught my brothers, friends and I how to wares. It being the dareful am not really, I tied first. Using all the steps my step dad told me to, and being patient with myself, I got prepared in the water. Out of the blue [literally, we were on a lake] I got up on my skills just like @CAPS1! No I could make all! In when the water level end came around and I brought my boat up to the cabin. I insisted her to cry water at ring. But when we got out to the lake, and I had skilled a few times in a lowest was up to here to decide if she was going to try skilling for sure. We sat there for what seems hill an hour waiting for her decision. But, in the end she decided not to try. I was very proud that day because I didn’t try to persuade was of pitch him into trying it. I was very patience with her. And although her decision was the wrong one in my opinion, I will not proud of myself to this day, for what I did on that boat.

When I was @NUM1 years old my mom use to be unpatient all the time and got so annoyed at! But then one day she was going to take a shower but then people kept on going and she got patient for a while and I got up there. I saw her and hide. As I peeked from end to end she was still standing there, almost falling asleep and she was still patience. Another stepped in the bathroom and I quickly went there and said “@CAPS1, excuse me but my mom is coming, she’s been waiting. So I woke up my mom “mom, mom wake up go take a shower!” and she woke up and took a shower, after she came out “ahh” it kind of feel good” that was better.” The end.

When I was about seven And my mom was pregnant with my @NUM1 sister. It was the night before she had her. We were all asleep. When my mom started to scream we all went into her room my dad asked her what was going on she said “she coming” my dad raced to the car put it in to gear and left without us and my mom who was about to have a baby. Then when my dad relized he forgot us. So when he got home to pick us up. It was already morning they took us to a room. They prepared my mom up. Me amd my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the deveiring room we were so paitient it took over an hour to get her out. when they were stiching my mom up the brought my little sister to get all cleand up. When we could see her through the window. I had to see her get her first bath, shots And when the put those patches on her I had thought she was an @CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. And we all liked that name. I was so @CAPS3 that day.

Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!

A time I was patient! Being patient is all about being tolerant and under standing. Sometimes when @CAPS6 in a bad mood I have @CAPS9 be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset it was buring @DATE1 vacation and my little sister @ORGANIZATION1 wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream tank that rade by every twenty minuts frome the ice-cream shop which was about seven @CAPS9 ten block away. I was bund @CAPS3 in my blanket when she jumped @CAPS3 on @CAPS9 my bed. “@CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I want @CAPS9 go get ice-cream. @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!!!” @CAPS5 I said in a mean voice. @ORGANIZATION1 you little hob –goblen get off my bed OR @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 YOU @CAPS9 A @CAPS10!!! I was younger and in a terrible mood that crying is sound so sill and stuped. Tears came @CAPS9 her eyes and I didn’t realize at that moment that she was little (fore years old) and didn’t quite understand that I didn’t fell good. I apologized and explained that I was sick. Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said “I made mama make you some tea”. That was hart warming @CAPS9 me. After I drank it @ORGANIZATION1 asked if I felt better. I said a little then @ORGANIZATION1 got @CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and new that she didn’t fully understand yet. So I got @CAPS3 and took her @CAPS9 the ice-cream shop @CAPS9 get some ice-cream. @ORGANIZATION1 was happe ans that made me happe. I fell extremely proud that I was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 eve whe she got on me nerves. I know I was n’t patient with @ORGANIZATION1 at the “beginning” but at the end I was.

It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and we were up @ORGANIZATION1. We all wanted to go on the boat and go tubeing. We vent cared out to the boat and go all ready to go, we tried to start the boat but there was nothing. My @CAPS1 and cousin took the back of the seats off and peared in the back, there was boat-roads of water the birage pump had stopped working. My step-dad took a look at them and said that it was going to be re-wired. He had soon re-wired the boat and it sill hadn’t worked all the kide were now getting antsy. Every adult said we needed to have patience. Everybody had now calmed down and walked away. Pretty soon we heard a boat start up that sounded like my @CAPS1’s we ran down there with excitement and sure enough it was started we hoped in and there we went tubing down the river. Later that day my mom had said to me “patince is a virtue.”
<START>

I’m constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I’m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked “@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?” @CAPS2 responded “with patience and years of practice.” The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom “@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?” @CAPS2 replies “@CAPS4, @CAPS9?” I answered “@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with”. “@CAPS6.” @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there’re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn’t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said “@CAPS8, I know you’ll catch on soon!” and I wondered out loud “@CAPS9?,’ @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper “because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.”
<START>

When my @CAPS2 and I got into the checkout line at @CAPS1, @CAPS6 heard impatient groans and signs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued her cheerful whistling, and didn’t seem to notice. “@CAPS2 this is going to take forever!” I whined. “@CAPS3’t be so negative. It’s not that long.” @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. “@CAPS5 about @CAPS6 play a game?” @CAPS6 continued a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store my @CAPS2 said, “@CAPS7, when you’re patient, you get food!” @CAPS6 both laughed and drove home.

Every year me and my entire family take a trip to @LOCATION2 to the @LOCATION1 beach. Everyone in my family that goes is me, my mom and my dad,(???). my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay in one big hotel together, which usually has @NUM1 bedrooms. Out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks. So I have to be very patient the other three hundred and fifty one days. While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait. I always have a great time and now I wait patiently for next year.

I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didn’t mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had payed off, and I had a great day.

I’m going to write about a time when my sister was being patient to go to the dentist. One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was so happy. Also my mama had to go to other places to. First, we went to costland mall to get me a homecoming dress. After that, we had to go to shoe depot get me some shoe. Third, I went to go get my hair done. Last, we were on our way home but I told my mama my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist, we had to wait @NUM1 min. I told my little sister @CAPS1.M.G this whole day you have been patient. I couldn’t do that.

So after climbing up the ladder I let the ? to my side and waited. Hunting required a lot of patience but I didn’t need any. There standing on the horizon of tree, was the biggest buck I had ever seen, I almost said it was so beautiful. Loading a stud into the barrel I took aim ?? Boom I shoti zzz+++! I missed luck! The stud tilted to the side. I reached for the gun so I could put it on ??  ?? sown and even the edge. The gun landed bend ?? I turned even to see the stud coming down.

Go! @CAPS5 coach yelled. @CAPS5 soccer team and I were running sprints to get warmed up for our game today. @CAPS5 day was planned, first soccer then @CAPS5 friends birthday party. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a rain drop pound down on @CAPS5 head. Before I knew it I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly it had started pouring. @CAPS5 team and I rushed under a nearby awning. @CAPS2! The thunder nearly shook the ground. Finally the refs come over and announced, "the game has been delayed." I signed and slouched down on a picnik table. I knew now I would @CAPS7 to be patient if I wanted to get through today. There we sat under the awning as rain slamed down on the root and thunder cracked." @CAPS1 would I make it to @CAPS5 party now?" I through. @CAPS2! @CAPS2! @CAPS2! More thunder came. It had to go @NUM1 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. Before I knew it we were already on minute @NUM2. Even the slightest bit of thunder and we would need to start back at @NUM3. We were now at minute @NUM4. We listened closely until we hear a @CAPS2! From far north frustrated I say "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 mon!" @CAPS5 team began to count the minutes again. Finally after the longest @NUM1 minutes of @CAPS5 life there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back on! @CAPS5 team and I sprinted on to the field. We played our hardest that game but, sadly we lost @NUM6. We walked off the field with our white socks and jersys splattered. With mud. Every one of us were sopping wet. @CAPS5 mom gave me the "@CAPS6 up" look and I quickly ran to the car." I will still make it to @CAPS5 party but, I will be just a few minutes late and I @CAPS7 to change in the car." I said to @CAPS5 self. As I sprinted through the wet grass I heard @CAPS5 coach yell from behind me, "@CAPS7 fun at your party @PERSON1, and @CAPS8 for being so patient!" I smiled and replied "@CAPS8 coach!" That day I realized being patient is a good quality to @CAPS7. Many people appricite it when you are understaning and don't complian during difficult times.

A time I had to be patient was when my dad was waiting to get the money for our chiuahuce @CAPS1. It was @DATE1 and my dada sold his giutar to his uncle to get money for the day of coarse he didn’t have it. A day went by and still nothing. When my mom came and picked his ??? I went to swim practice trying to be patient and wait for my dad to get the money. At around @NUM1’oclock my dad called saying he won’t get the money till @DATE2 @TIME1! I was mad, but still tried to be patient. A few days went by and soon it was @DATE1 again. I was so excited. We finally got @CAPS2 I had been patiently waiting for a week and was tired of it. So when I was him my patience was worth it. That was the time I had to be patient for something good.It had really paid off.

Being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school how do you use patience. A way is being understanding to your teacher because they’re there to help you to teach you for life. If you don’t be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them they were tolerant with you. If you don’t have patience with you parents and don’t listen to them then you won’t learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life.

Once I knew a girl whos name was @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They had been inseperable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular. @PERSON1 called @ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was and or if she wanted to hangout. @ORGANIZATION1 kept lieing to @PERSON1 saying she was busy and always said lies and blowing her off. But one day @ORGANIZATION1 had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized how she was acting. @ORGANIZATION1 had learned that @PERSON1 really was a true friend and was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient only good thing can come.

Patient I was patient when I was in @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 appointment to wait in the waiting room. My some teacher says wait a minit because teachers are talking to someone else. When I have any @CAPS3 teacher says don't open it so I always been patient. When someone tells me to wait. I also be patient when I'm waiting for the buses, airplanes, trains to come. I be patient when I'm bored to wait sometimes. That's how I've been patient.

I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patient. I had to use patients when I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box @NUM1. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. Alls I did was sit in a chair and watch him. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again. So then we had to take the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patients because if I didn’t I would have been really bored. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it. I t took @CAPS1 @CAPS4 almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patients so the system could be delivered. Patients is a very needy thing in life. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have patients.

It was hot and it felt like I was walking smil. The line would not go any faster. My older brother was happy for some reason. No one could understand we were standing in line in @NUM2 weather. I was being as patience as I could be I just stood in line wish, hoping to pay self we could get on the oder. The first hour went by and another sighn came up @NUM3 hour from @CAPS2 point. We all got mad. The walk way sounded silent. I know that everyone could hear a pin drop as a drop or someone’s?? hit the ground. Everyone being patient. Finally we wated @NUM4 hours to go on just @NUM3 ride. That was the first time I was that patient.

I remember the time when I had to be so patient, it wasn’t even funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to get one when the school year started. I waited and waited until the school year started but my mom told I would have to wait another week because she didn’t have the money from all the school supply shopping she had done. So I waited another week. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents plan a trip to @LOCATION1 that weeket, so I had to wait another week. It was on the following @DATE1 when I was at my cousin’s house and my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone and I was so happy that I finally got it. So I guess you can get cool things when you are patient.

One christmas about a year or two ago we drove up to my grandparents house. They live in cold water so it took about @NUM1 hours. All my relatives on my dads side were there. All the presents were under the tree and I couldn`t wait to open. The parents were just talking about nonsense, so I opened my big mouth and said “can we open presents now,” we stated to open the presents but the adults had to go first. They are the slowest gifts openers ever I was about to rip the presents out of their hand`s and open the presents I didn`t do that thought because I was being patient. After they finished I said,”yes” of course thought my little cousins had to open next. Let me tell you they aren`t fast at all either. After that I finally got to open my presents. In the end it was worth it I got an x-box @NUM2, and over @MONEY1. That was the time I was patient.

Patient is a very hard thing to do in life. It’s one of those things that is so impossible for people to do some times, even for little kids. You can tell when someone being patient is when there being polite and waiting  their turn without complaining about it . Sometimes people don’t like being patient I know I don’t lik to a lot @CAPS1. People who are not patient tend to @MONTH1 be not ??? tuned others wait. But people who are pacient they sometimes tend to be anoying or quiet don’t talk very much even when they do talk they ??? talking when people inturupt them. And they defiantly don’t yell as someone  out at all. It’s a good thing to have patiencets because you will grow up with an ???

A time when I was patient. Was when I went to the book story and I woned a book. I was at the book store and I wanted a book called tayler swift back at the @LOCATION1 as a school girl and my mom said if you are patient then yes, and I was so happy because she know I love tayler swift book and her life. As soon as I got it I stared reading it. My mom said thank you for being patient I was you welcome I said thank you for buying it. I have told my mom that if we could go to the book store and she said not today and I keep on asking and she said not and I keep on asking and she said maybe. So I was and the car listen to radio and we when to the mall and there was a book store in the mall and I ask if I could look around and my mom said yes and she said find the bok that you wonted I find it and she bote it. This is a time I was patient. One thing I learn is to be patient if you want something and dont keep asking.

A time when I was patient. I am patient when I go hunting. I know that at an moment the back of a life time could walk out in shouting range. And if one does I will be ready. The first time I shot a deer was with my baw. And I remember siting there being as patient as I could waiting for a deer to step within range. Then l hear the leaves cranching . The there it is the deer I’m going to shout?? How you draw it back. Than I shoot I could feel the arrow gliding throw my bow. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud and the deer takes off. I wanted there in my tree stand ready to go blame my deer. Me and my dad traked it about soft and there it was. I was so excited that all yelled. It was nice to know that all my patients and hard work had payed of. Thank you for reading my story. Hope you enjoyed it.

I remember when I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my step-grandmother for @CAPS1 and went fishing. I didn’t really went to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek we were going to fish in was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the ‘backyard’. I flung my fishing lips into the water and waited. After maybe @NUM1 minutes or nothing (except my sister who caught most things.) The finally started to unravel. Excited, I kept out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the real. Twisting and twisting the handle for what seemed like forever, I brought it up. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My step grandmother threw the fish back. After another @NUM1 minutes I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster then ?? I’d caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step grandmother. My patience lead up to me catching the biggest fis of the day and learning something new.

Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So I’m happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.

I was patient when I had a doctors ipointment. Me and my mom had ben waiting almost an hr for them to call me. Twenty minitues later the nures calls me. She says sorry for your wait. Thank you for being patient. Then after that my mom took me to get something to eat so we were waiting @NUM1 minitus later the gives us are food from the drive through. Sorry thanks for being patient.

This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me.

A person I know that is patient was my old teacher named @PERSON1. He was a very patient man although we got on his nerves. It we didn’t understand a question that he explained a million times he was still patient. Even when we got attitudes with @PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person I’ve ever ???

Patience, whats the first word that comes to your mind when you hear that word? Waiting? I know that’s the main word in my mind. Here is a story when I was very patient. Every kid dreads meap testing it was @DATE1 and we have to be completely silent. It’s hard enough to be quite. But it’s harder when your next to your friends, and your a girl. We had to do meap writing, writing is the most wrost for me. But when I was done I felt really good and quiet for everyone else. That’s the story when I had to be patient.

Patient can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to resturaunts when we wait for our food I get board very easially. On time when I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer. A couple months later, it still hurt in the same spot.@CAPS1 my mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I did go to the doctor she felt for a lump or fracture in my ankle and said “I don’t think there is anything wrong, but we won’t be sure.” @CAPS1 she sent my mom and me to the urgent case out on @NUM1 with a note that said I needed an x-ray. After about a twenty five minutes car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in we waiting in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while. I had to have patient because we were waiting there for a whole hour! Clearly, this was a time I had to have patience because I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle.

Being patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is example of me being patient for my birthday. My birthday was coming and I was extremly happy. I would always backtrack of my days so I had a personal calendar for counting down to it. After that I made lots of birthday lists. I went to stores to see what they had. For an example, I saw this beautiful short that had a matching belt.  @NUM1 days before my birthday I would not eat. I also went to @LOCATION1 and check out all the wonderful cakes. The day came and we went shopping for all the stuff I wanted. I conclude  ??? I was patient.

A time I was patient was when I had to be patient for having a difficult task without any hep. Not one comeint from me. It was so hard. I had one hour to finish it. I needed three hours to finish. It was so hard not even collage student could finish I t. @ORGANIZATION1 was the hardest match test I ever done.

“@CAPS1, how much longer.” I complained at the airport, “@CAPS2 have been waiting for about two hours now.” “@CAPS3 will only be a couple more minutes sweety.” replied my @CAPS1 in a stern voice. “@CAPS3 better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to @CAPS5 world.” I complained again. As you might know now, @CAPS2 are in an airport full of people. @CAPS2 had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a @CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @CAPS2 went over to the @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I haven’@CAPS8 said anything to my @CAPS1 the past two hours or three hours. I didn’@CAPS8 want to bug her so I left her alone. When the next hour passed,@CAPS2 boarded our plane finally. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS3 was a painful but memoriable experience. When @CAPS2 boarded the plane and found our seats my @CAPS1 said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I realize why my @CAPS1 and dad don’@CAPS8 like to fly to places any more.

@CAPS11 was @DATE1. @CAPS11 was almost time for @CAPS1 birthday. @PERSON1 was going to be six years old. He was helping his @CAPS6 made his birthday cake. After they were done making the cake mix, @CAPS1 @CAPS6 put @CAPS11 on into a cake pan. She put the pan into the oven for @NUM1 hours. I can't wait for my sufer yammy chocolate birthday cake to be done!' said @PERSON1. A 'few minutes later @PERSON1 asked if his cake was ready. '@CAPS3 @PERSON1 said @PERSON1 @CAPS6, '@CAPS4've  still got about @NUM2 hours and @NUM3 minutes you're your cakes done" "@CAPS5 that @CAPS4'll take for ever" whined @PERSON1 "You've got to use your patience @PERSON1 " she said." @CAPS6 whats patience?" @PERSON1 asked "patience is waiting for something without complaining @CAPS11" explained @PERSON1 @CAPS6. "@CAPS7 you can do something @CAPS9 the time passes by faster. Like play a game, ride your bite, play with your friends, or play in the sand boy. " " @CAPS8, " said @PERSON1, " I 'll go do something else.' @CAPS9 @PERSON1 went down stairs to play his video games. When he was done play his video games, he checked the oven to see how much time has gone by. There was two hour and thirty minutes left. @CAPS9 @PERSON1 decided to go out and ride his bike. He put on his helmet and got on his two wheeler bycicle. He went for a ride on the neighborhood trails. He saw his friend and joined them on their bike ride. After their bike ride @PERSON1 asked if them if they want to go play in the sand box. They all said yes. @CAPS9 they went to the backyard and played in the sand box. @PERSON1 and his friends all made this huge sand kingdom. @CAPS11 had big castles and @CAPS11 had a trench all around @CAPS11. @CAPS11 took up the entire sand box. @PERSON1 went inside to ask how much time was left on the oven." @CAPS6 how much time is on the oven?"  asked @PERSON1 " Only five more minutes ," said his @CAPS6, " you should take that time to brush off all that sand. I see you and your friends are covered in @CAPS11. And when your done you can invite them in for a piece of cake. When @PERSON1 and his friends were done getting the sand off of them they all went inside and hold a piece of cake. After everyone finished their cake they all said," @CAPS11's the best cake ever!""

“@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2!” I yelled. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; @CAPS3 @CAPS4. “@CAPS5 down, @PERSON1,” my @CAPS2 told me. “I’m coming”, she said. I’m not usually super hyper, but I just love roller coasters. It’s also nice to just take a @DATE1 off and @CAPS1 up to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I live in @LOCATION1, so the drive isn’t that short. My @CAPS2 had just finished giving the man our tickets. “@CAPS6 your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4,” he told us. “@CAPS9, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first?” my @CAPS2 asked me. “@CAPS10 about the @CAPS11?” I asked my @CAPS2 “@CAPS12 not?” she replied. By the way if you didn’t know my name is @PERSON1. But that’s not important right now. What’s important is getting on the @CAPS11. My @CAPS2 and I waited in the line for about an hour. It seemed to take a while, but before I knew it, we were buckling up. Now I know the @CAPS11 isn’t the biggest ride, but it’s still pretty big. The @CAPS4 is, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. The @CAPS11 ended up being a blast! After the @CAPS11 we rode the mantis, the @ORGANIZATION1, the wicked @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS17, The mean @CAPS18, the @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 and the @CAPS22. “@CAPS23 right @PERSON1, pick the last ride,” my @CAPS2 said @CAPS24 that was easy. We still hadn’t gone on my favorite ride yet. “@CAPS25’s go on the @CAPS26 force,” I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. @CAPS24,  I’ve been on the ride, and it’s definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer. The wait was four hours, and I wanted to leave after three. I waited, though, and even though I thought it wouldn’t be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and I’m glad I waited for the best ride.

I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also about waiting for your ??? like when you are bored.

One time when I was patient was when I broke my thumb I was patient cause I wasnt complaining about it wasnt crying about. Really wasnt doing enthing cause I didn’t think it was even broken. I wasnt really bothered me. Then I wait to the doctor and got it checked the docter didnt think it was broken cause I almost beat him in a thurb wreste but he x-rayed it just in case. When he came back with the x-rays he said it was broken, he was very suprised I was suprised every one was.

Sometimes its hard to be patient, especilly when you have to be tolerant to little kids. Well I have to do that sometimes, when I go to visit my little cousin, @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 is eight years old and get on my nervers. She asks dumb questions and does stupid things and I don't like her at all. My mom says, "When you grow up, you two will be best friends," @CAPS1, right, I don't think so. When ever I visit her I just have to tolerant her and be patient. For now I have to deal with her, but when we grow up we might become  friends, but maybe not.

One time I was going hunting. We got to the woods @NUM1 or earlier. When we got there we found a spot to sit on the ground. We were goin  to stay in the woods till dark or we kill our limit of deer. When it was or @NUM2 ½  hour till dark we seen a dow but when we moved the gun to shoot it it ran. We stade not moving or talkin  waitin. Then more deer came. But they were really small so we let them go. When their was like @NUM3 minutes left till dark a good size dow came. It was to far away tho  so we waited for it to get closer  the boom the rifle goes off. It dropped but it was still alive laying down. We waited like @NUM4 or  more minutes then it died. That was one of the times  I was patient.

There is many ways to be patient like while your wating in the lunch line to pat or when you line up to leav the room. Heres a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was talking to some and I wanted to go right away but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient.

Patience, can you be patient? Some people are and some are and some  are not. Some time  I can not. Well hear is a story about patience. One time at school in the lunch line, it was long. It would bearl  move. I wanted lunch so bad I was not being patient. But for some resson my friend was being patient. I said to her why are you so patient? She said because everyone is going to be able to  get something to eat. I said yeah that is true. So I tryed to be patient and before I know it I was siting by my friends  talking and eating my food.

I had to be patient when I really wanted a @CAPS1 bike crank and I had to make money for it so I went to @CAPS2 houses picking leaves till I showed them shouveling drive ways. In @CAPS3 time I had the money for my @CAPS1 bike. It was hard to be patient but in the end it payed off.
<START>

A day of dreadful patience “can we leave now @CAPS1. I’m so bored I complained.” I waited for an answer but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in @LOCATION1 waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. Impatient guys. “That’s it I’m gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and don’t touch anything.” @CAPS1 said. So I sat here cold bored and hangry waiting for what seemed like hours. Finaly my @CAPS1 got back and told me it might be another @NUM1. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while. After we got some food we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A fork lift driver not somehow managed to get his fork lift stuck in the trailer. That’s when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out and then all heard was holler’s and screams. FINALY! After my @CAPS1 yelled a bit we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that some thing I definitely don’t have is patience.
<START>

The time I had @NUM1 be patient was when I was at my first foot ball game. I wanted to get in but I had to wait. I waited an hour to get in. The team was tied in the @NUM2 to @NUM2 and it was the @DATE1 and we were still winning. The coach had an injured player so he put me in I ran so fast I tackled the guy with the ball he tumlied and I ran for the touchdown. If I wouldn't have been patient I wouldn't have won the game cause the coach wouldn't have put me ind that was the time I was patient.

One time I was patient is when I went to get my hair cut and she told me to come at @TIME1. But when I got there at @TIME1, she had like @NUM1 people in front of me but I didn't care because I didn't have to do nothing after. So I was just going to sit there and be patient and I had my best friend with me so I wasn't bored and we was just sitting there talking and texting our boyfriends. So then the lady that was bout to cut my hair came to me and said I am so sorry, but I told you the wrong time and I said oh it's ok l can wait. And when she got done with they hair the ladies came to me and said they was sorry. So then she had @NUM2 person left and by the time she get done be getting on like @NUM3 - @NUM4. And that was the time I was being patient.

To me,  patient is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. “Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?” I asked wondering if it would easy to get it. “@CAPS2 buddy we just ran out.” @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess I’ll have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didn’t grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort.
<START>

I have patient until @DATE1 vacation comes along. I try to do my best in school until @DATE1 arrives. @CAPS1 example, last year I was on the honor toll @NUM1 times. Over the @DATE1, if I have to do back regards or a @DATE1  patient, then I will do it and I won’t leave it @CAPS1 the last minute. Then, I’ll wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. I’ll also wait until @DATE1 again. But in between we have some breaks and days off, I think we yet have enough assignments throughout the years, start we go school @NUM2 days a week. School can be really fun sometimes, @CAPS1 example, I wait until field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so principal doesn’t take our privellages away, @CAPS1 example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, she’ll take it away from us. That means all of my patience will be @CAPS1 nothing. That really wouldn’t be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing the trouble.

A time when I was patient well it didn’t just happened once it happends all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping she brings all the females in my family my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car or stay at home. I will talk about when go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just don’t go to one mall and stop they go to at least two mall three max. They go to a lot of strip malls too for exsample simply fashion and things like rainbow. They are going to a hundred place for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and im getting hungry and tired but, I don’t complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females clothing stores like victoria @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2.

You have to be patient when you go on a trip. I was patient on my trip to???P A last @DATE1. I had to be patient to @NUM1 hours before me and my family arrived. The next day I had to be more patient because we went to an amuesmed park. There I had to wait in very long lines,’@CAPS1 is really hard to be patient. Is @CAPS1 hard for you to be patient. That’s the story when I had patience.

Patients  to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @NUM1 then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid.  But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time.

Clunk! I @CAPS1 in my seat as the rental car crashed into another pothole "look whose awake so my mom berked as annoying as possible. "You slept for long was though him might sleep until school that back up. "@CAPS2 are we" asked in a dreary voice. "ohio" replied my mom's friend @PERSON1. We were going to @LOCATION1 with my mom @PERSON1 and me @CAPS3 @PERSON2 over spring break. We would be staying in the florid @CAPS4. While we were there we would be visiting my dad as he was working in @CAPS4. I was going to be a memorable trip, but I knew the car ride there would be the ultimate test of my patience. It would take us @NUM1 or @NUM2 days to reach our destination. The @NUM3 day would be the hardest of there all. This was the day we would he driving through the mountains. I can usually pass the time when I am riding in the corners, the ?? the @CAPS5 ??. However when we reached the peak of the @NUM3 mountain, everything went hectic. First off, my @CAPS3 (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there were not any guard rails and we were in the lane close to the edges. Second, my @CAPS3 started grasping my arm like her life her depended on it. Last, and worst of all, my bladder started getting up! All of things combined to make our pleasant ride through the mountains, a rollercoaster ride that I will never in a moment ever forget. The whole time I was thinking to myself."I 'm going to go insane! Just make it stop. As if on cue, the screaming came to a halt, the pressure of my @CAPS3's grasp on my arm was relieved and we were pulling into a rest stop with bathrooms. If I had not been patient during that ride through the mountain I would have gone insane. I would be sitting in all asylum. I will always remember that ride through the mountains.

Today was the first day I was patient. I couldn’t believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said “@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you don’t get this line moving then I’m going to have to talk to the waiterger. All the guy said “I’m so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before you”. “@CAPS2 are you kidding me” she yelled as she stopped way and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I’m inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said “Do deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be inpatient again.

A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my gymnastics meet to start. I had to wait two hours along with my team. We warmed up and stretched and were talking about who we thought would win the team trophy. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said it was going to be another hour. So, we talked some more and practiced some skills for floor. We dida head-stand contest and did as much as we could to make the time go by. We asked our coach another half hour later and he told us it was going to be a half hour longer because they had to get another judge. Finally an hour later the judge got their and the coaches had their meeting and we stan?? The meet. That is a time I was patient.

I’m going to write about when I was patience. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone she said if I be patience I will be able to get a phone so I was patience. Time flew bye and family she sad yes see when I was patience to get a cell phone I got one. Have you ever been patience with your family? Tell me did it work out of did it go bad with your family if you are it probably will work for you.  And that is what happens when you are patience.

“@CAPS1 !Did it came yet!?” I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop.She was I n standing from the mail box, holding a thick wad of envelopes .One of these, I hoped was the letter. “@CAPS2 yet honey ,” she said “but there’s plenty of bills to go around.”  I wanted  to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what @CAPS3 said ,”  just wait long  enough and you’ll get what you want”  I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesn’t sound that important but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get @NUM1 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire @DATE1 for results .Pretty good system ,huh? No ! Pretty soon, other things distracted me swim meets, tennis, book, and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. @CAPS3 was right I guess. One @DATE2 @TIME1, on the @DATE1, I was on the porch reading. Out of the coner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced classes: @CAPS4 studies @CAPS5 @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off!
<START>

The time I was patient was the time I was @NUM1 years old on @DATE1 it was a snowy night and my mom and dad were buying a new car it took so long I was so hungry mom and dad were talking with the car dealer my brother and sister were playing @CAPS1 when my mom and dad were done talking with the car dealer they looked at the car they wanted and one of the worker's brought me and my brother and sister a box of cookies and milk while my mom and dad were looking at the cookies we got hungry again but I showed patient's. My mom and dad found the car they wanted they chose a van with a @CAPS2 inside they paid for it and we left when we did my father took us to @ORGANIZATION1.

One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were writing in line to put school supplies. We were number @NUM1 and they just called @NUM2. It was around @PERCENT1 out and we had to stand there. It was so long the new battery I had just put in my @NUM3 went dead. It took areand @NUM4 hours just to get inside. Then there were even more lines! We barly got our things that day, but because we were patient, we did.
<START>

I didn’t know where we were at. Then my dad told me, we were at this place called buddies. I’ve never been there until that day. Then the waitress put us at a circular table. Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a diet pepsie. My sister got a fruit punch. As always. My mom and dad got a mountain dew. My brother got cherry pepsie. I don’t know why we all got different drinks. It took @NUM1 minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasn’t so patient. He knew that the food will take forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait for that was @NUM2 minutes. My dad was very impatient. I was the only patient one at our table. The resturaunt wasn’t even that busy. I told my dad to just be patient the food will be right out any minutes. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, then left. That was the time I was patient.

I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. Me and my family were setting up decorations one day for my @NUM1 @CAPS2. I was so excited and jumpy. I was turning ten soit was a big deal for me. We all ready had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running @CAPS4 it and “@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.” @CAPS4 it. The party started at @NUM2 am. I was in my pretty pink flowered dress and putting streamers up. I keeped @CAPS4 asking what the time was, and my mom would just say to be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited I couldn’t wait. I then remembered that I was supposed to be patient so I was. I played games and read books while I was waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it the door bell rang and all my family came running in with presents and curds. I guess all that waiting really payed off. I also got some really cool presents.

I waiting  I was looking forward staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got on trophy. @CAPS1 and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.

Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boreing . There were a lot of people in line that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didn’t because that would berude. I felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more. Plus I would not want people cutting in flont of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait.

A time I was patient was when I was sitting at my house for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want.

There were many times when I was patience. Maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your home work. Maybe waiting days for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. @MONTH1 be waiting days for your teachers to come and give your tests back. But today I am going to talk about when I had to be patience to get my first dog. @CAPS1 was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We couldn’t find the right one. @CAPS1 took @NUM1 weeks til we saw the cutest chichuacua. He was only one year old. We were rushing through the papers scared some one else was planning to adopt him. When we turned @CAPS1 in the lady said we had a back side too. After the paper work we had to wait another week because they had  to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog store they told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @DATE2 we thought we could pick him up on @DATE1. On that @DATE1 we picked him up @CAPS1 took @NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @NUM3 years for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog.We didn’t find one, but we waited and if your patient you will get something for that. We are still patient to maybe get another dog if our parents allow @CAPS1.

I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher’s or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I’d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one.
<START>

I can’t really tell you about a time when I’ve been patient because that something I struggle with no matter how hard I try to be patient it just seems to be impossible but it’s not, maybe. I just don’t try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatience I am is I’m at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I won’t save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can’t spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it don’t want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom say no I always sneak it and get in trouble. @NUM1 words.

Patience is being able to wait for something. For some, patience is hard and for some its easy. For me, I'm ok at patience. Like I'm patiencet for this game I pre-ordered. It comes out @DATE1. When I'm not patiencet is when I want I get on the computer. I Was also patiencet for getting my second class rank, well thats all I have to say about patience.
<START>

A time I was patient was when I got my shots. It was just me and my dad. I had to get my shots because I was sick. It was still cold outside because it was in @DATE1. We went to the @ORGANIZATION1 for children. In the beginning, I was at home getting ready to go. I put on an orange turtle neck sweater and jeans with sneakers. I didn’t want to go because it was after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information then we sat. In the middle, we start to watch television. I was really bored because it was nothing on but informercials. They had us waiting fo over an hour. I start to get hungry and very upset.  They finally called our name. In the end it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a juice. Then she told me I was getting @NUM2 shots. I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots. The information I got was just as painful as getting my shots. They had us wait for a very long time. I was sad to have to wait but happy it was over.
<START>

I have exprienced patients when I went to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 hour strip, we were in a small car and we were a little caradable because we didn’t sleep very well last night even though I brought a book & my @ORGANIZATION1 game we were still pretty bored. All I did watch trees after my battery end on my @ORGANIZATION1. Dad was considtrated on the road, mom finally and license plates to see travelers. Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you could hear, mom, @CAPS1 and my stomagh growling, we didn’t stop. We had to get to @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotels front desk shut down. At @NUM3 we were crushing through the state of @LOCATION1 to then arive at @TIME1 at the hotel we were so excited that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes in the bed.

Being patient, what does it mean? It means that; “you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn’t complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn’t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn’t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn’t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!
<START>

Being Patient. Being patient has it's good & bad. I have had good things happen to me. I @CAPS1 I had to do was be patient. Here are some good things that happen to me. A time when I was patient was when I tryed out for the dance team at my dance studio. I was so nuervie l never tryed out for anything befor. I had to wait &wait & wait for my dance studio to call my mom. One day when I was at a friend house my mom called me and said "@CAPS2 you have made the dance team." I was so happy. I couldn't wait to learn a new dance. Then I could saw everyone at my dance compitions. It will be so much fun. Another time I was patient was when broke my arm. I had to be relly patient. I had to be so careful of my arm. I had it in a cast then I waited to get it off. Now I have no cast on. I was so patient that the doctor said that it was healing & I didn't need a cast any more. If you are patien better things will come.

Once I went to @CAPS1 world and we were waiting for about @NUM1 hours to get on this stupid rude. I was they because I had my @ORGANIZATION1 so I played that but on to an hour I got bored. I picked on my sisters and it was on watching them get mad. Then I got bored with that so I just sat down on the road.
<START>

In my own words patience is when you have to just be com and quiet. And not all hyper and annoying. Patience is just controling yourself. And not being all rude and disrespectful to others.

One day when I was at my sisters football game. My mom droped us off at the game because she had to go to work. When I got out of the car she asked me if I had my money with me. I said no then she said your just going to be hungry. I said @CAPS1. @CAPS2 when the game started. I got really hungry. @CAPS2 I checked all of my packets, it just @CAPS2 happened that I found @NUM1 bucks. @CAPS2 I went to see how long the line was. The the was @CAPS2 long it was almost in the street. @CAPS2 I sat back down trying to let the line get shorter. But the line had gotten way longer @CAPS2 I ran in the line. I had to stand in the line for about @NUM2 mins. @CAPS2 when I finally got out of line I stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer. @CAPS2 she came up to us and asked me to bye her some @CAPS3 fries. I said no because the line was to long. @CAPS2 she said please! @CAPS2 I went back in line and it moved way slower. When I got back she said, what took you @CAPS2 long. I said look at the line. @CAPS2 that is one of the times I was patience.

I think patience is like somebody or someone is waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom then the other person can go to the bathroom. Like I am not in patience because I want to go a store now but they said wait your patience. My whole family is not in patience but my friends are.

The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late. I shold of known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing. We were the first people in line so that was a go thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun.

So in the @DATE1 game of the season I got in four times. In the first @DATE2 I got in for about one minute. the I got in for @NUM1 minutes in the @DATE1’s. I was happy but I still wasn’t starting. then we got into the play off’s I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point I was gonna quit but my teamate’s came up to me and said don’t worry your gonna your time to start everyone will. Over the next few month’s I waited patiently. Then we got in tournament’s then we split up the team with older people on one and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoff’s then we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient.

Patient help you got through life. If You aren't patient then you won't know where to go next in the future. @CAPS4 uncle had to be patient face month. He was running a muck just @CAPS5 for a phone call. Finally someone yelled just be patient they will call. He bid  us being patient is the hardest thing he was to do. He was dined why they couldn't call the next day. He said ended up forgetting about  here and there. He said he was trying to be as patient as he could be. @CAPS4 under was waiting for a patient ??? America's next  @CAPS1 @CAPS2. They add him they would call if he got in. They soon did  because the phone mug. A woman nicely said "@MONTH1 I speak with @CAPS3 sanders please" @CAPS4 uncle replied "yes this is him! I  @CAPS5 for a month! @CAPS4 family kept telling me to be patient! So now I don't have up anymore!" " You are in! so keep on practicing! Someone else will call you with the details!" " @CAPS6 you so much!"then he hung upon the phone " I'm in!" @CAPS7 was the happiest days of our lives. @CAPS4 uncle with through a lot. Really all that kept him on the ground was him being patient. He told us @CAPS7 was hard but @CAPS7 worked out great and the ending. Here's future advice. Always and I mean always be patient. Your not going to get anywhere in your life if you aren't . Patient is an important @CAPS8 of your life.

A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins won’t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldn’t think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue.”

Sitting in the car waiting for @CAPS2 mom to get out of the house and into the car.When she got in the ca    we were off.On the way to the???  For the @CAPS1 party I got pretty bored after about a couple minutes,when got out of midland I thought  it would go by preety fast but I was wrong it was slower than ever.I was bored out of @CAPS2 mind and the thing s that made it worse was that @CAPS2 little sisters were screaming in the back.So  then we stoped at a gas station witch felt like forever.I preety  much never talked the whole way up there I was trying to be patient but I  couldn’t take it.I manged to calm myself down after about an hour of the girls screaming.They finally fall asleep.I just sat there loking out the window when we where about forty-five  minutes away it felt like we have been driving for days.It was probly like @NUM1 minutes away when the girls finally wake up.They started screaming “Are we there yet”@CAPS2 mom and dad just keep saying “@CAPS3”When we pulled into the drive way it was probly the happiest thing that happened hat day.I thought I was preety patient on the way up there but on the way back I might just sleep.At the party I was  patient  until we could open the presents.I freacked  out.I hope next time none of that will happen.

Being patient is hard to be. First of all its like your waiting in a??? a and line that could take forever. Being patient at this line could take long time but it could go by fast if you had something to do. You could bring a book to read and read at the way up to one from the line or be patient and???.

One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, I’m very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at @CAPS1 point like on the way there, getting a campsite, and also in lines. But in the end, it’s all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient

I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!

I know a time when I was patient. My friend @PERSON1 was coming back to the football field after we scored a grant @NUM1. We were gonna hang out. It was two and a half hours before he got their. When he was there we both were patient to play the game or do what others wanted to do. AS the day progressed the sun was like a tanning booth. The grass was also as dry as cactus, but the day moved on. Finally when we went are own way. We knew we had patience.
<START>

One time when I was patient my friend @PERSON1 went to the mall around @NUM1 am. @CAPS2 were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes. When @CAPS2 got there the sun was really bright up in the sky, the birds were chirpping, and it was as hot as a @DATE1 day. When @CAPS2 both walked hardly anybody was there but @CAPS2 went to a store called???, it was so full of people  I thought I was at a concert. @CAPS2 had to wait in the longest line, it was so long people were almost at the doors. So @CAPS2 both waited and waited.  Finally @CAPS2 were at the front of the line and the casher said “@CAPS1, you have waited in the long line probably for about @NUM2 hour. I will give you guys a @PERCENT1 discount.” @CAPS2 went shopping and @CAPS2 got rewarded for being patient.

A time that I was patience was last @DATE1 when I went to @CAPS1 point. I was about to get in line to ride the @CAPS2. I was at the begging at the line and then I saw a sign that @CAPS3 two hour wait from that point. But I wasn’t that close to the sign so for me and my family and the other people that were in the same spot as us we must likely have to wait at lest two and a half hours. Well it was a hot day out and I was wearing black which probably wasn’t the smartest @CAPS4. So I was waiting in line for about an hour only I just couldn’t take standing in that hot wheather anymore but I really wanted to rive that rine so all I could do was to wait for another hour and be patent then I was about @NUM1 minutes away from the ride and then the line just seemed like people left for me that was good cause then I was at the front and I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long. That is a line that I was paitent.
<START>

One day in the @CAPS1, I had to sit for two hours cause I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there a lot of people, we stay there a very long time, cause there were only @NUM1 docters and this lady took so long. So it was my turn to go in but I was scar that if hurts but then he was doing and it didn’t hurt for nothing. And then I went home.

awhile back, my best friend @PERSON1’s grandpa died. They weren’t blood related but they were really close. At the funeral, I saw @PERSON1, and her sister @CAPS1 force a smile toward us. @CAPS1 left to go talk to my parents. Then ,@PERSON1 started crying, that she wouldn’t see her grandpa’s gravestone, because they were moving  to @LOCATION1. She changed subjects, about the good times she had with her grandpa. I lauged and smiled with @PERSON1. My parents later said we had to go to chuch. I hugged her and told her everything would be alright. She smiled ,”many contrary . “@PERSON1’s eyes filled with tears, “I don’t want to move to @LOCATION1. “@CAPS2 weeks later, she did with her family.

My at saying your patient is. Your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.

Onece, when my family went to @LOCATION1, we all had to be patient. There is a water ride where you get in a log then you sit and it takes you up a hill. You wait until you get to the top, then you splash down a hill. Well, that was one of everyones favorite rides, so there was a long line. We had to wait for a half hour to ride it once. So, in order to do something, it takes time so you must be patient. If your not patient you probably want get to do what you wanted to do.

Patience is the ability to be tolerant,understanding and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isn’t  something they teach you in my school. There isn’t a book your assigned to read called  patience @NUM1,there is no movie called patience is the key. Non of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and it’s not at all wat  i had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to  the strength meter at a county fair. What people really don’t understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure theres an ocasional car being blown up bet  not today, not for me. I here the clock in my hand so ‘tick,tock,tick,tock’. @CAPS3  @CAPS2, there’s come action. The subject (the person I’m assigned to watch is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is bay a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodlle a design in the dirt, with my foot. I’m just about to abort the mission. Seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with finger print revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor sorround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes. I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if I’m able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, I’m sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. “@CAPS2!” I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says “open.” @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says “@CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor.” I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to sucsesfully complete  my mission without being  patient.

I remember a time when I was patient. I was so patient that the doctor gave me a sucker. I was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. He told me to wait a second, but I wasn’t waiting a second I was waiting for hours. My mom couldn’t wait any longer she was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would fill like time is going faster .She said, she is going to try, but if it didn’t work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. Me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat.

So you want a story about being patient well your in lack. So the story starts off with me at the doctor’s office so I’m waiting. I was going to sit here for a few hours so so @NUM1 @CAPS1 I’ll read something. So I’m reading and all I here is wineing oho screaming so I ??? ono yes. But not mad.

When I was patient I remember writing an article at sea world when I  was very little. I didn’t complain because I knew I would get those sometimes my sister was complaining being she was in a bad mood. We stood in line for @NUM1 minutes for a role called @CAPS1 drop, or something like that I can’t remember. Then there was a line at the ??? for ???. We waited @NUM2 minutes plus the time for every to get out.

A while ago when I went on a trip to cedar point in @LOCATION1, it was an hour and thirty @DATE1 drive to go there, the reason why we went was because of my dad work @CAPS1 @CAPS2.

We walk around looking for the ride and more importantly he line. So we finally??? the ride my attention was drawn from the ride to the  line ,my mouth practicely hit the ground with the expression  “@CAPS7 luck getting to the that ride”, my father looked at me than my sister  “ where is mom and will?” I pointed over by the faress whell being covard of course. So we just get in the line and sign, it was at least @NUM4 something degrees. we waited for almost two hours and finally got to the front, we got into the chair and a bar came over us, I remember one thing set a quarter on  your leg and gravity takes a hold of it . A minute @CAPS8 we are going down like a neteour the quarter doesn’t float @CAPS9!  At that split second were on solid ground now the ride was not really worth the wait, but hey I’m not a covard.

I did my homework and read magizens. I was very worried about my mom. But then the doctor comes in and says no one can see her for a whole day! I had to be patient and wait till the next day. That was the time I had patients and it payed off.

A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the @CAPS1 before a lot of people and was drawing for the next @NUM1 minutes. I was patient throuout this time because if wasn’t I might’ve been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color as some might say because instead of drawing a smiley face I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checker board. It took the entire time and I am still not done with it. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient.

One time I was patient was at the doctor, cause when I was little and I was at the doctor I was running around and did not give a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me so she sat with me where ever I went. Mind you there were girls around so I got embarrased and asked mom why are you following me and she replyed cause I don’t want you running everywhere. That when I told her mom I older now, I’m not sorle years old, I’m muture now. She said @CAPS1 go ahead so I went over sat next to some girls and talked to them. Thats when we got up and start walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying “your mom is still following you so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down we ate and everything, and I so happen to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said “was you following me and she replied yes I mean no. so I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story.

Patience is when your understanding and tolerant. Also a person that experiences difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on @DATE1 twenty second. That day my mom wasn’t even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sisters’ face I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was.

I am in the @LOCATION3 @CAPS1 sea cadet corps .When I packed my things in the truck I had wait in a @NUM1 hour car ride till I get to my training in port @LOCATION2. We were driving in a truck that fit five people we were fitting @NUM2 people in it, I was the one stuck in the back with all the gour. Some ones sea bag had a boat in it that was stabling in my back I tried so hard not to complain about it, it took all my patience to last half the way there till I had to move the boot in my bay I grabbed the bag that had the boot in it and there wit to the other side. When  I thought all was well @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 started sighing at very annoying song I didn’t  think my patient could handle staying in that torch with their sighing .Finally we were at port @LOCATION2. @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 stop sighing and my patience had held through. But then there was the cheat in line their were @NUM3 people in @CAPS3 at me waiting to check I’d had a feeling my patience was gonna blow up and I’d go crazy. But it didn’t I stayed there patiently until it was any turn to check in, sadly the officer at the check in desk was old and talked very slown it was so hard understanding what he was saying. I finally was checked in my patience had survived!!Then I found out my friend logon was banked up gave me. Which he can be very annoying.” @CAPS4 boy I thought,” here comes another test ror my patiences. My patience was tested through the as ride, the clean in line, and also through that whole training. But my patience was very strong and survived!!!

@CAPS3 was about a @NUM1 hour drive to freedom hill and we had just left our house. Dad, mum, @CAPS1 and I were going to see buddy guy and @CAPS3 was going to be a @NUM1 and a half hour concert. As we pulled in the parking lot, the policeman guard pointed to the open parking spot for the jeep and we drove into @CAPS3. We got out and drank pop and ate sand whiches because we had an hour or so before the concert started. After @NUM3 minutes, or maybe @NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time stopped I waited and waited until I thought about @NUM5 minutes had passed. I was expecting buddy to walk on stage any second, but @CAPS2 never did. After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked “how long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down?” “about five minutes.” @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. “how long?” “six now.” @CAPS3 wouldn’t have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. “The performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.” @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over. Finally after @NUM7 minutes of dying and waiting, @CAPS2 walked on stage. @CAPS3 was the best sight in the world. @CAPS3 was worth the long, long wait and I enjoyed @CAPS3 even more. We packed out for the rest of the night.

A time when I am patient is at gymnastics. There is multiple ways you have to be patient at gymnastics. Your mind, and body have to be patient, and sometimes you have to be patient with the coach your mind has to be patient when you wish you do things but you really can`t. your body has to be patient when it feels like your ready to do a skill but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping. So sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes until they can finally help you. Patience is a very important life skill that everybody needs to have.

When I was at universal studios and I was waiting in the long lines to get on the rides I was patient. It did take a while but I never got mad or impatient. My dad and I was in a line for this dragon rollercoaster we were so close to being next then it started raining and lightning. A lot of people left so we ended up being in the front of the line. We waited for another hour or two but it never stoped. We forgot about my mom and brothers so we left. I was patient the whole time. We went and got in line for one of the new rides they just got and since it new the line was long. We waited for quit a while. We eventually got on the ride and we realized the wait was worth it so we went again.

When I was @NUM1 years old, I went to my first doctor's appointment it was extremely nerve naking. I sat in a chair next to my mom, shaping, wondering, non-stop for @NUM2. I was running around and when I finally sat down I said." @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! I couldn't be patient anyone. So it walked out the door, when the nerve called your next." And I was like ," well that wasn't long, only about @NUM3 and a ½ , " @CAPS4 it's only @NUM4 and we got here at @TIME1 " @CAPS5 that wasn't long," my mom said. Next time when I go to the doctor I will be extra patient.

Being patient means that you are understand and tolerant a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. I’m writing about a time when my friend @PERSON1 was patient. “@CAPS1” @PERSON1 said to @ORGANIZATION1 as he was leaving to spend his whole @DATE1 in the upper pininusula of @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 were dating since the beginning of the year. She was sad @CAPS2 weeks had passed and @CAPS4 was the beginning of a new school year .She had been patient all @DATE1 @CAPS3 to see him again. Finally the first day of school came she skipped up to him and he @CAPS3 called a way .Couple of confused weeks late she said to him are you jumping  me or ???He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient waiting for an answer @CAPS4 never came. Finally she decided to jump him but, she never did. So @CAPS5 gabby and me did .@CAPS4 far her on the outside she was mad but on the inside she was probably screaming today she has “moved” on and now is dating a boy named @PERSON2.

To @CAPS4 being patient means to not while if you ordered something and its taking long to come to you. That’s what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life but just one poped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasn’t going to be bush over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music.” mom that our favorite song.” @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said “you have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here.” @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost faint because of how much people there was. “lets just calm down I mean how long will @CAPS8 take for a sudden a deep voice in my head said, “ @NUM2 hours later”. My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. “@CAPS8 you don’t crack @CAPS5 its are turn to take the pictures I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You have yourself a deal.” @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and a sleep @CAPS5, the @PERSON1 family your next.” The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. “@CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @CAPS12 you have to do anything I want”. I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in there  life just like @CAPS4

Over the @DATE1 my dad, my brother and I went to @CAPS1 point. It was really hot but we didn’t care we really wanted to ride the millennium force. We found the ride but we first looked at the line it was huge. It shaked almost around the whole ride twice, so we got to the end of the line and sat in the blazing hot sun for a half an hour till we found our cover selves under a tent they put up so it was some what cool in line. So we waited a longer and longer till my brother started to flip out yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, “I can’t wait here any longer” @CAPS2 he went under the ?? and ?? off. My dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him. So I waited an hour when finnaly, it was time for me to get on the ride but my dad and my brother were not here so l decided to wait in the line going to the front of the ride. When l got on they still weren’t there, well the ride took off and they weren’t the best ride ever with me.

My dad is in the @ORGANIZATION1. He goes away for long periods of time. The only time he comes to ritit us is in @DATE1, near my birthday. But one year my dad wasn't able to come home when he was supposed to. He sent us a letter saying that they were keeping all the trooper for an extra six months. I felt depressed for the longest time. But then I thought about it. Even it was delayed, he was still coming back hopefully. So I decided to be patient rather than disappointed. Our family sent him care packager over. Eventually he did came back. That was a hard time, but it was patient and got thought it.

I was the only one who got to go on the @ORGANIZATION3. Because I stade in line to go on the @ORGANIZATION3. My family cept going on diffrent rides title the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 rid and the @CAPS3 or even the @ORGANIZATION1. While I stood in line at the @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 fares wheel and the fun house later is that very same day I got to go to the star in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 and wated in the humongus line at the cash register and by the time I had got up to the cash register my family was getting massages. was pachent at @ORGANIZATION2.

RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here!  It took lots of my patience  to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our  three day stay at  @ORGANIZATION1.  I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased  @CAPS4 I didn’t care.  I finally snapped to it and kept my cool.  In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of @ORGANIZATION1 & friend  in my group named @PERSON1  told me some ideas, @CAPS4 I wanted to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they weren’t bad. I thought about ??? of the ??? and used it in my pamting. ??? now we’re at the nearly @NUM1 feet high ??? ladder  I  already took my ??? going up and zipping down the awesome get scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient @CAPS4 man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, @CAPS4 I said to myself “be patient.” @CAPS4 this on kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he  just sat right on one of the big planks of word. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most.

Patience is useful in certain times like waiting for a blood test or to me your ??? again. In other times patience is usless as in the army, any army, you sometimes wait to die by the hand of your enemy .Patience is mostly good because if you rush you might hurt someone, miss something helpful, or just something you enjoy.

A time when I was patient: I'm patient when my family, or friends, or teachers are talking. I don't interapt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite, I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink, or getting your lunch, or going in a single file line for a firedrill.  You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done you can help them out and that would be really nice and patient. These are the things I do to be patient.

Patience is tough to achieve sometimes. But that doesn't mean you should give up keep trying and your will succeed, rush through life and become impatient and you used and succed. I will tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience. "@CAPS1 year in the fall a big race takes place. All the animals in the @CAPS2 come to the. It is an extraordinary event. It is a tradition that @CAPS1 year, one slow animal and one first around commute to see who is this up is champion. At the time the @CAPS5 was the fastest @CAPS2 around. @CAPS11 signed up @CAPS1 year and won @CAPS1 time. The @CAPS15 had signed up to complete this year. @CAPS11 was very wat don't in himself and was had to pride that @CAPS12 because @CAPS11 was about, slow and @CAPS11 can't be a champion. "runners get ready!" shouted the announcer. The @CAPS5 and @CAPS15 lined up. "@CAPS3 @CAPS4!! " @CAPS5 rushed ahead kicking the air. For the @CAPS15 very slowly waiting behind. @CAPS5 run like @CAPS11 has never won. @CAPS11 never looked back. @CAPS11 wanted to win. The trophy was rightfully his any ways. Right? I mean, @CAPS11 was the fastest animal. @CAPS15 continued on his way, slowly but surely making his way to the finish line. "@CAPS6 @CAPS6 ." @CAPS5 stopped and looked around. No one was around. "@CAPS9 is that noise?" @CAPS11 asked aloud. "@CAPS6" it came from his stomach @CAPS11 was so caught up in the race @CAPS11 didn't realize how hungry @CAPS11 was. "@CAPS12 one little handful of berries." @CAPS11 decided. @CAPS11 picked a handful, then another and another. Finally @CAPS11 was full and a little bit sleepy. "I'll @CAPS12 take a little nap after all that @CAPS15 ain't gonna catch up anyways." @CAPS11 laid down and slept. Little did @CAPS5 know that the whole time @CAPS11 was eating and napping, @CAPS15 was catch up? @CAPS11 saw the @CAPS5 sleeping and decided but to wake him @CAPS12 to case @CAPS11 was sick is @CAPS11 continued to slowly very slowly walk up the hill to the inish line. @CAPS5 woke to the sound or cheering. @CAPS11 stood up. The @CAPS15 won! @CAPS11 raced to the finish line but was to late, the @CAPS15 had already won. If @CAPS11 had been patient @CAPS11 might have won.

In my thirteen years of expirience I have road many roller coasters, and when there is a rollercoaster these is normally a two hour wait. In the @DATE1 @NUM1 I took my best friend @PERSON1 to "@CAPS1 @CAPS2," and we had just gotten in line for a ride called "The @CAPS3." When we got to the entrance @CAPS4 said a forty-five minute wait so we got in line and the ride broke down for over three hours. Finally the ride was up and running but @CAPS4 took another half hour for testing and when that ended @CAPS4 was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so @CAPS4 didn't realy affect us. We finaly road that ride and was totaly worth @CAPS4. Most of the lines later that day were small but thats still one hour. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down.

I remember a long time ago when I was patient for a long time. I was patient for about four months. I was waiting to get the video game system @CAPS1. And I was extremely patient for this. So basically what happened was that there was this new, high tech, amazing game system coming out. The @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 . Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold out. So for christmas, my dad told me that he would get me one. I was so happy. But we both knew that it would be a long time before he could get one. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then one night around @TIME1, my dad wake me up. He said that they were selling alot of @CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to watiest, and waited in the line for a long time. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up.

My friend and others showed loyalty in a play called @CAPS1 children’s @CAPS2 . They come once every year. Everyone gets ready, learns their parts and we put on a show in a week. We showed loyalty by believing in each other. When you are on a stage in front of people you have to support each other. When someone forgot to enter on time, you would help them out by reminding them the next time. When someone forgot their line, you would help them out by saying it for them. We showed each other loyalty throughout @NUM1 days. The play turns out great each and every year from supporting each other.

My own way about patient is that when somebody is doing something. You have to wait until they done. An if you rush them they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is a very important thing. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you not being rude.

Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don’t. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!

A time when I use patient was when I finished my book. We have these thing’s called teacher talk’s where you tell the teacher about your book what you finished.

I had to wait untill I got called. Everyday I would go to @NUM2 and @NUM3 hour hoping I would be called. But everyday it wouldn’t happen. I finish another book so I wrote my name again. But I still didn’t get called. I put @PERSON1 @NUM4 witch means I finished @NUM5 books. Eventually @DATE1 my name got called. I ??? to the teacher with all @NUM5 books. I got to tell her about my books and I was very happy I got my named called.

When they put one bracket on I felt so weird and kido tasted like heated metal “@CAPS1” I said. After they had put on the brockets and then they put colors. My mouth hurt like crazy! When it was all over I noticed  it had been @NUM2 hours! I was surprised because I didn’t know I sat there for @NUM2 hours, but I was very patient and waited that whole time! That’s the time I was patient at the dentist office.
<START>

A time when I was being very patient was when I went to “@CAPS1” at ceider point.. I went to ceider point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins. It was just the older girls going, because we new if we took the little people we couldn’t go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were rediculasly long. I mean it literaly took us about an hour in a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called “The dead zone”, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say “were going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesn’t have any mechanical problems.” That’s when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down a waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called “The mauerie”. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we enough patients to get back on, I don’t think so.

One day when I was buying a dirt bike helmet online it said three day shipping and to me it wasn’t very long. When the third day came and I was waiting on my porch for my helmet to come, my mom broke the news to me that my helmet got stuck in @LOCATION1 and it wouldn’t be here until next week. after she told me I figured that did just have to be patient, as for the next week I just went to work with my dad. after my week was up, and I was sitting on my porch waiting and I almost fell asleep when a @ORGANIZATION1 truck came and gave me my brand new helmet.

I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things .If you be patient things will actually come faster than you think for example if you want something and you have to wait in line instead of running off and finding  something else at and wait it will always help. Be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even. If your waiting for a same at stem to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble. Be patient what even  your  doing  even if your waiting for a turn just wait it is not a big deal stop rushing things, just be very patient.

“@CAPS1 on @CAPS2, where are you ,” @PERSON1 said in a frustrated undertone. @CAPS2 was suppose to @CAPS1 over to his house .@PERSON1 had just gotten a new trampoline and they were planning on oon bouncing all day after school .@PERSON1 was starting to get worried but he waited .Finally his mom came and told him that @CAPS2 wasn’t coming. Thats when the phone rang .@PERSON1 answered it and heard @CAPS2 on the end. “ @CAPS5, @PERSON1,” @CAPS2 croaked. He didn’t sound well. “@CAPS2,” @PERSON1 shouted into the phone, “@CAPS2 , @CAPS2 where are you.”  “I’m at my house, get over here. @PERSON1’s mom pulled up at @CAPS2’s house and let him out. @PERSON1 didn’t care about manners at this point,so he opened the door and marched to @CAPS2’s room. @CAPS2 was laying in bed looking up the cicling with his face looking very swollen. He turned to look at @PERSON1, held his gaze, then looked back at ceiling. @CAPS2 wasn’t at school that day either. He went skiing up at his family cottage. I wasn’t patient when I was in the air. I got crushed and none of it would have happened if I had waited.”

One time I was patient was at my dad house. Our power had just went out so we figured wait up to two minutes just like it always happened. after a couple days we didn’t have power I was ill patient. On day three we called people and figured out ???ahead our power lines they fixed it and we got our power back.

There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up it’s distracting. Now that you’ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Let’s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten

@CAPS7 year @CAPS4 went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was about two weeks before school started .That day schools by @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 just opened so there was no lines to wait in .@CAPS4 couldn’t or picked a better day .Then @CAPS4 got to the mantice I didn’t want to go on it, but @CAPS5 mom said “@CAPS1 will go wrong, @CAPS2? I said “@CAPS3 fine I’ll go on to the ride” @CAPS4 are about to take off going up the hill and right when @CAPS4 got to the top the ride stops.’ I was freaking out at first but then I got over it. So wel have been up there for about @NUM1 min or @NUM2 and @CAPS4 had to be patient.’ @CAPS5 mom and dad are on the inside of them.’ @CAPS4 were sitting on bicycle seats @CAPS4 were not comfy. So then another @NUM3 min pasted by and now @CAPS4 have been stuck at the top for @NUM4 mins.’ @CAPS7 is were @CAPS4 had to be completely quiet and patient.  Then the ride started and @CAPS4 got down to the bottom and finished the ride .They gave us a pass for us to cut in line on the @CAPS8 force .That is all they gave us. So @CAPS4 had fun the rest of the day, but that I learned in life you have to have patience!

Once upon a time their was a princess named @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 was invited to a royal ball where @CAPS1 awaited her handome prince. As her carriage  arrive @CAPS1 stalked at the people before getting out. Finally @CAPS1 stepped out of the vehicle. @ORGANIZATION1 walked down the red carpet. As @CAPS1 arrived, the more noisy it got the princess finally aproched the opened doors. The beautiful girl walked to her throne and warched the village people dance among her. @PERSON1 sat for two hours. @CAPS1 wandered “will he show up?” and “  will he like me?” @CAPS1 doubted her luck. The princess grabed the microphone, “@CAPS2! @CAPS2! Does @CAPS3 know where my prince is?” “@CAPS3?” a complete silence went over the croud. Finally at the last minute. ‘@CAPS4” an anonomyse voice crosered. I am the prince!” A sigh of relif came over her. “@CAPS5 I’. I’m so late ??? fought a dragon and a thousand knights. To get here  to meet my love!” awwwww! The crowd said softly. And they lived happily ever after. The @CAPS6!

The one time I was patient is when my mom took me to go get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there the parking lot was full I mean cars was so close you could hardly get in and out without scratching someones car. My mom parked across the streets the streets. When we got in there it was at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 people it parked. People were standing so close to each other you would know their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were parked like dardine. It was hot and smelled like must. We picked a ticket with @NUM3 on and they were on @NUM4. We waited for two hours. My mum wanted to leave. When they got to our number I was sleep. Wile we was in there I lost ten pounds.
<START>

I’m not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when I’ve been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didn’t complaine once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn’t too bad. that was one of the few times I’ve been  patient, and don’t know if it counts since I was with somebody.
<START>

“@CAPS1!”I yaled as the ball came over the net right to me. ” That was @CAPS1!”@CAPS2 said.  “@CAPS3 I was already there.”I responded.  “@CAPS4. @CAPS3 it’s @CAPS1.” @CAPS13 argued.  “@CAPS5 I said @CAPS1, you??? Moved and let me get it then wimp @CAPS6 me. And watch the ball drop. I exclaimed. “@CAPS7 I guess.”@CAPS2 apologized. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. “@CAPS9 is @CAPS10 @CAPS11!” the A team coach demanded. “@CAPS12 partner up in groups of three!”@CAPS13 said??? Mu two best friends som and @PERSON1 were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good. “You want to be partners with me and make? “@CAPS14 asked. “@CAPS15, “I responded. When it was our turn on the @CAPS11 we were going against @CAPS16, @PERSON1 who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, @PERSON1 and @CAPS16 all cheered. “@CAPS18! Very nice job ladies!”??? One of the coaches. It was the end of the second @DATE1 tryouts. There was only one more @DATE1 left. It was hard for me @CAPS3 I managed to keep together and patient. On the @DATE1 of tryouts we got to know our teams. We all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time. Me, @CAPS16, and @PERSON1 plus some other good girls made the A-team! So that’s a time where I had to be really patient and stay together, @CAPS3 I still came through and succeeded.

AHH! Oh hi my name is @CAPS1 I’m going to tell you how I waited @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS2 to do something sweet. Ok I heard about this awesome but scary place called the @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Me and a few friends of mine @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 plan to @CAPS7 there in @DATE2. So far me and them have been just doing the ordinary. @CAPS5 up, @CAPS5 in the shower, @CAPS5 dressed, @CAPS7 to school. Today @DATE1, @CAPS8 are going to my parents’ house and @CAPS7 online to see when it opens .@CAPS8 found out in two days the new location will open up. It is near the parlor and down the road of @ORGANIZATION1. So @CAPS8 cheak it out and its nearby so @CAPS8 are so read to be screaming like a baby when it gets its bottle tooken away. Today is the day @CAPS8 are on the road but what @CAPS8 did realize was how many people would be there. When @CAPS8 got there it had at least @NUM3 people waiting! @CAPS8 sat in line and about every @NUM4 minutes the line decreased by @NUM5 people. Then finally about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 of waiting @CAPS8 were in the to @NUM7. It was just own luck too, @NUM1 people were not patient enough to wait but @CAPS8 were respectful. Then @PERSON2 had to @CAPS7 use the rest room so @CAPS8, walk across the  street so he could @CAPS7 then when @CAPS8 came back @CAPS8 ended up in the top @NUM9!@CAPS8 waited another @NUM10 then @CAPS8 were in! By the time @CAPS8 were done @PERSON2 was crying (he is @NUM11!) @PERSON1 wet his pants ( he is @NUM12!) and @NUM13 and I didn’t do anything ,@CAPS8 had one heck of a night but it never would have happened if @CAPS8 were not so patient.

Patience is an important thing to have. If helps you and other respect yourself. If you are not patient things will only get worse. My cousin is a big @PERSON1 fan. She wanted tickets to his concert, but when the sold out online she didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that the were giving away tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be first in line. Well so did everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket both. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and did not complain. Later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1’s face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result. Maybe if my cousin would had been so patient she would have gotten the tickets. Patients will get you @NUM2 long way, especially if it trying to gain respect. My cousin has inspired me to be @NUM2 patient person, and maybe I will get concert tickets someday.

When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom, and dad. @PERSON1 has downs syndromd. And he likes to wach game’s. He like’s to cheer them on whene their playing.

I dident make fon of him win he talk’s. I dident win he walks and or win he make nosies that are funny. He think of every one as his filend wich they are. When he standing in line he dosent move vary much. He yell’s wen @DATE1 port has the ball and is heading for a tuch down. When he gets mad when spirg port, don’t have the ball and they score. I @CAPS1 him That we will get it @CAPS2. He say yeha I now that. So he like’s to go on to the feeld to wach. But they won’t let on the feeld yet so I @CAPS1 him to be patience so he will calm down. When the game’s over his mom take’s us to @LOCATION1 house. We sat in the @CAPS2 being roud and taking. But she did not get mad.even now we had to set in a hour traffic jame. So after all that what I think patience is.

I was patient last year when I was when I was taking the ??? and it was not done. I hate being patient and when I do it is boring. Patients seem like they take forever. And then people just start getting head akes and then you get in trouble by your mom or dad or teachers for talking to much. And that is why I don’t like being patient.
<START>

Patience is when you can wait for a long pereied and not complain I don’t think I have very much patience. I think patience is like waiting in a line for hour’s and not careing because you are very patinct but every thing takes patience games, driveing, eating waiting and even being at school all taken lot of patience.

Hi, I’m @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I have green eyes, blonde hair, I have a good personality. Okay, so am going to tell you about a time when I was focused. Okay so it was @NUM1 last year yar @DATE1 I think. My mom and I were left for a doctor’s appointment. So we left around @NUM2 after school started. So when we got there I was just waiting for like @NUM3 hours bored out of my mind. I didn’t know what to do so I saw the fish @CAPS3 I was watching them for about @NUM4, doing nothing then finally the women of the counter desk said , “@PERSON1 then I knew it was our turn. So we went in the room I layed on the bed. I went to sleep on accident, but while I was sleeping they gave me a painful shot it hurt so bad. Then I woke up and that was the time “when I was paitient.”

But when I finally got it I was glad I was patient the wait was wen worth it especially because I relly waited my @ORGANIZATION1.

Patience, it’s something that my family doesn’t have. Here is the story. Wile am doing the dishes my little brother is crying cause my little sister @PERSON2 hit him. So sence @CAPS1 is crying (my little brother). @CAPS3 starts to cry (my little sister). So then my step dad is playing on his iphone. He is going to yell at @CAPS1 pretty soon.

But @CAPS1 just won’t so l call @PERSON2 in here and @CAPS1 got to hit her then my step dad starts to go crazy cause he is still crying now @PERSON2 is being a brat stomping of the stairs. When ??? got ??? calm down. Now just as l am about to go crazy @PERSON1 (my older brother) comes in and takes  @CAPS1 down stairs to calm him down. Thank @CAPS7, for @ORGANIZATION1.

We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well , yesterday, I was very patient my sister, @PERSON2 throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don’t know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here’s the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldn’t let @PERSON2 go up to clean”  it. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. @MONTH1 I remind you, she’s ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her. “friend” @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet zazin she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1 got @NUM1 said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1’s  text messages. I’ll admit @PERSON1 wasn’t being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We weren’t yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. I’m not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!

Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you’d have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an “epicfail”. But I still live. Playing the piece isn’t so bad, it’s just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I don’t have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says I’m going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. I’m not really looking forward to this year’s @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping I’m not going to get any homework. But if I do, I’ll just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. I’ll have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly.

Even though you @MONTH1 not know @CAPS1, there is patience all around us, you @MONTH1 not even know your using the patience like a line for winch or writing for something, but you are .Here is a story. When I used patience. One day, on a hot @DATE1 day at wider point, we decided that we were going to go to the water park. As soon as we got there we jumped the first pool I waited for my dad. After a while of playing we decided to go on one of the water well @CAPS1 was the water well at the park. @CAPS1 was so big you had to take @NUM1 flights of staying to get to @CAPS1 but after I went back I knew @CAPS1 worth the wait
<START>

My story is about a time when I was patient was in (@DATE1). I was waiting for “@CAPS1” to come. I was being patient because we were going to @LOCATION2. I couldn’t wait to go but I remembered to be “patient”.  The less I thought about it the faster time passed by. Then it came, it was time to head to “@LOCATION2” when were in the car on our way there I couldn’t wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldn’t wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there.  I had to nare patience because riding in a car from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 is a long drive. While being patient I got to see many things and travelled through different states.
<START>

Patience is something is most people don’t have. In the story, patience was something that I needed. If I didn’t have patience in the story, I don’t know what I would do. This is my story. A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I don’t, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasn’t out of the store. There was so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didn’t let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out, I wasn’t mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies why she was late. Most of the time I am not a patience person. Actually, I am never patient for situations like that. I was so glad I was patient for this story.
<START>

Sometimes on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, I have to control myself so I don’t just go off on someone or totally say something mean to them! Like @DATE1 actually we are going camping up in @LOCATION2. We always go for about a one to two hour hike. And when  we do we go to lake @LOCATION1 but just before that to get there we take an “adventure hike,” so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods and over or even through the river. But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates the by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! (@CAPS3 sometimes I get annoyed at myself!) @CAPS4 on the way back its more fun after we go swimming in the @CAPS5 cold water! (@CAPS3 my dad says it clears my head! But it really doesn’t!) And by the time we get back, we are ready to have dinner, but dinner isn’t ready yet. @CAPS4 I get to be in a bad mood… again! And have to wait some more!
<START>

Two years ago, my two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didn’t sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2. She would sleep during the day and wakeup at night they eventually taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience but she was finally adopted.

The time I was patient was last @DATE1 when we went to the cedar point. When we went to cedar point there was a long line when we got to the front of the line the machine broke. @CAPS1 we had to go to a nother ride and I couldn’t wait @CAPS1 long because I had to go to the bathroom @CAPS1 I walked out of line and went to the bathroom. When I came back there were more people in line @CAPS1 I just waited.
<START>

My dad @PERSON1 is patient everyday.He goes to work and can’t want to come home, but he doesn’t go crazy  like me cause I wanna leave. No ,he does his work and waits till @NUM1 when he can leave and go home. He always patiently waits till @NUM1. My dad always been a patient person andto look  up to him because of that patience .

I was at the great wolf loge and we could not go in because some kid poop in the pool and a big part of the pool was brown we could not go in for three hours and it was very boring then we went outside and there was a pool there the hole time.

A time when I was patient, I have been patient plenty of times but one I mostly remember is when I was waiting for a friend to get home from school (I missed schoo) while waiting I did plenty of things. I played my xbox @NUM1 and I got on the computer. But while xbox I saw one of my friends come online. He lives in @CAPS1. Moures @CAPS2. After he got online we played most of day then I got off and watched @CAPS3 because I was bored. Nothing was on so I got on the computer, still bored. So I tried to take a nap, didn’t work. After that I tried to play my xbox but after another hour (nowaround @TIME1) it got bored. I still played for about another half an hour till I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more till he got online. We played all day till night

My friend @PERSON1 was patient last week in the lunch line, he waited about @NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line. He was behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders. @PERSON1 was patient by not cutting in front of them and didn't complian. The line was longer because there was a presentation and then it was lunch, the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders didn't have lunch yet so that was why @PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he did a good @CAPS2 waiting. When many students were filling up the tables I saved @PERSON1 a seat next to me. @PERSON1 finally got his lunch and I saw him go over to the @CAPS1 and milk cooler and grab a orange @CAPS1. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When when he came and sat down next to me I told him he did a good @CAPS2 be patient and waiting to get his lunch. I was almost done with my macovoni and cheese when @PERSON1 said, "@CAPS3 for safeing a seat for me." When we both finished we took care of our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We were glad we didn't have to be in that loud, crowded cafaterra. In the gym other kids were playing a small basketball game. @PERSON1 grab a basketball. I waited until the @NUM2 grated were done, I was patient, the teacher then told the younger students to go back to class, when I got the ball I asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to play around the world. It was one at @PERSON1's and I favorite game we played.

One day me and my friend @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 to alabama. It was the most boring thing @CAPS3! Imagine just driving in a car for @NUM1 hours just driving and stopping to use the bathroom. And to make the matters worse I had the smallest bladder there wich as I can imagine @CAPS4! But we did get to count waffle haoes because the farther south you go the more people like waffles. I’m not kidding there was at least one waffle ???. And a kind of ??? was we weren’t just going to alabama  we were going to the @CAPS5 of alabama. So when we finally ??? ??? still had to wait @NUM2 more hours. But when we finaly got there we had a blast! And I have to admit one good thing came from experience ??? rides don’t bother us??? ???.

I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient. My cousin was at my house and needed help on math homework. Because no one else was home, I had to help him. We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn’t know how to do any of it. So I had to sit there and teuch him how to do it, and then explain how I got the answer. And did I mention that he had three pages to do. It was almost two hours before we were done with it all. And that was a time when I had to be patient.

@CAPS2 father has recently lost his job. It has been hard. It has exactly @NUM1 since @CAPS2 father has had job. @CAPS2 father has been constantly applying for jobs. But he didn't give up. He kept on trying and trying. Fortunately @CAPS2 father has a job interview in san @CAPS1 in a couple of weeks he is going. Hopefully he will get the job.  Thankfully @CAPS2 father has been very patient. Even though he is being rejected constantly, he still trys very hard to get a job. @CAPS2 father is @CAPS2 I role model because of his amazing level of patientence. Thank god, I have someone to care for me who his as patient as @CAPS2 father. Without the patience of @CAPS2 father @CAPS2 family could live. Well job or no job I will always love @CAPS2 father. This would be true because of @CAPS2 fathers great level of patience. For that main reason that is why @CAPS2 dad will always be @CAPS2 heroe and number one beloved role model

Patience is a very diffult thing @CAPS1 some people. One time I was at a huge party. But none of my friends or cousins were there. I was board the whole time. I asked my mom if we can go home she said "no". Then I sat down I waited and waited @CAPS1 a really long time. Then finally we went home. The next day my mom sent me over to my cousins house @CAPS1 a sleep over. This was because I was being patient at the party. I learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing. You recieve good when you be patient.

Melay was a little girl, waiting for her parents in the @CAPS1 bush. @CAPS5 didn’t know why @CAPS5 had to. Her parents second distressed all the time now.” @CAPS2 must be something I did,” @CAPS5 thought. Her sister was not as patient as @CAPS5 was waiting. @CAPS5 had to be doing something all the time. So when her parents didn’t come and somebody else did @CAPS5 wasn’t happy. Boys came walking along the road @CAPS6 @CAPS14 were hiding carrying @NUM1’s. Melay was thinking, “these are boys waiting along the street. Are @CAPS14 crazy!” @CAPS3 their parents told them to hide @CAPS2 was always for a good reason. @CAPS5 sat @CAPS13 thinking about this when @CAPS5 heard a loud crack! “@CAPS4 was that’s” @CAPS5 thought. @CAPS5 looked to @CAPS6 her sister was supposed to be and @CAPS5 wasn’t @CAPS13.” @CAPS6 was @CAPS5?”  @CAPS7 @CAPS5 looked out to @CAPS6 the boy soldiers were standing around laughing.” @CAPS4 were @CAPS14 laughing at?” @CAPS5 looked closer and saw that @CAPS2 was her sister. “@CAPS10!” @CAPS5 cried out. “@CAPS6 are my parents, @CAPS14 should be here by now,” @CAPS5 thought. The boy soldiers were walking towards her. Thats when @CAPS5 saw another two married and depleated bodies. @CAPS5 found out that @CAPS2 was her parents. @CAPS5 started running. Running away from tragity. @CAPS5 made @CAPS2 a mile before @CAPS5 had to hide. @CAPS5 hid in a bush. The boy soldiers were walking around looking for her. Suddenly one cried our, “@CAPS13 @CAPS5 is!” @CAPS14 dragged her out of the bush, and walked for @CAPS4 seemed to be forever. Finally @CAPS14 reached a build. Melay was screaming at herself,” @CAPS3 only I waited. @CAPS3 only I waited. @CAPS14 took her into a room and the boss raped her @CAPS14 quickly shot her to death and dragged her into a dumpster. @CAPS3 only @CAPS5 had waited.

A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well I get out of school at @TIME1 my dad gets at @TIME2So,if  I wanted his  help , I would have to wait myself  but I didn’t understand it. Even with homework that needed help on back in my backpack until my dad got home I wished the homework that didn’t need help on. After my homework   that which I did all my @CAPS1, then it was time to eat, as I ate my dinner. By that time I was done waiting my dad me, more and really to help we as my dinner. It was last to go to wait over my dad to help understand it so much more.

On @DATE1 my friend @CAPS1 and I climbed on the bus headed for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together till @NUM1 am. We had been riding all diffrent rides all day and we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front said “wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours”, but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started a @NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnixous screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said “@CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6” all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did.
<START>

A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to @LOCATION1, really it had only been about a month. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had an awesome time. I had to be patient at @ORGANIZATION1 since there were long lines for the rides, so we had to wait a while. I had a really fun  time in @LOCATION1!

Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular.                My first one is when people don’t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don’t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesn’t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn’t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I’m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs.

I remember a time when I was patient, it was kind of hard to just there waiting on the doctor to call my name. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady havent called my name yet, after waiting like @NUM1 minutes. I just turned my @NUM2 player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine.  Before I knew it @CAPS2 called my name, “@CAPS1” @CAPS2 said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room @CAPS2 directed me in. When I left the doctors office and I was going on I thought to myself “maybe being patient isn’t that bad after all!”
<START>

Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctors or in the hospital. What I do to pass time when I’m at the doctors is play I spy. I play it with my mom every time. There is usually a lot of people at the doctors when I go. There is magazines but I think they are boring. Therefore I play I spy to stay patient. Otherwise I would be very very bored.

@NUM1. Last, year I had to go to the doctor on my birthday. So after I came home from school I left right back out. When we got there we had to wait in the lobby. There were crying babys every where, we still had to go to the movies, and shopping. @NUM2. There were still to many people in front of me. I started to get mad. Finally, they called my            name. I was so happy I didn’t know what to do.

A time when someone was patient was when a guy named @PERSON2 was driving and a little girl named @PERSON1 was walking on the side walk and it was a red light. She yelled out loud “go old man”  the old man went and she flowed him to the store and she asked what was that and @PERSON2 sales that was nothing .No you tried  to hit me no you were rushing  me so I went. @PERSON1 saies to @PERSON2 I was looseing or patience .@PERSON2 tell her well learn how to control the in.

“@CAPS1!” @CAPS2 whined, her voice escalating into a wail. “You can’t do this to me. I’m ten!” “@CAPS2, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I can’t leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work honey!” “@CAPS4 can’t you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year!” @CAPS2’s mother sighed. “I know you liked @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just wasn’t fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 “@CAPS7 if!”. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2’s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county’s only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. “@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment” @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother’s red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, “@CAPS12, why don’t you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting “little” @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2 we need to talk.” @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,” honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe he’d still be game for you.

I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom can decide when I would get my phone. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was acting very patient  so my mom would think it’s time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasent little angel. But she still didn’t say it was the time to get a phone the next @TIME1 @DATE3 I acted the same way but better. I still didn’t get it I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day @DATE1 I cooked my mom some breakfast and I was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone. Nope she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am so I dressed very professional\ casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said “@CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get something” I smiled so  hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and I wondered my ma said “wait @CAPS2” me still wondering   watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @DATE5 the last day for the week. I dint do anything but mop all day.  I was still being patient though. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friends house. @DATE4 my mom was up when I got up for school and she said “@CAPS2 you can have your phone now and I hugged her tight and run out the door very eagerly to try it out.

A time when I was patient I was patient on @CAPS1. I got to open are presents at nine thirtey in the morroning I had to wait and wait. So for two hours I wacth telavison. I though @CAPS2 would be hard @CAPS4 I made @CAPS2 through. That @CAPS1 I thougt was the funnest @CAPS4 I lied I think this year will be. That day I made breaskfest in bed.

One time me and my family were at @CAPS1 point over the @DATE1. My sister really wanted to go on all of the small kiddie rides with me but I didn’t feel like it. I wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It looked really cool so my dad and I ran over to the entrance, but when we got their the wait time on the board said one hour and fortyfive minutes. I really wanted to go on this ride but really wasn’t worth standing in that line. So when the line started moving and we were half way their the signs said @NUM1 minutes. I told my dad maybe we should do this another day. But my dad said that we’ll be trough soon and he told me for just watch the people on it go by and not talk. We moved up only a little and the time was at @NUM1 minutes, so my dad said maybe we should do this another day and then we left the line to find my mom and sister.

I was patient once when my dad had said he was going to give me a letter every @DATE1 because he was to far away for me to visite he lives all the way in @LOCATION1. He told me I had to be patient because I’m not really the patient tipe.I guess being patient is not all that hard. For me to be patient I have to being doing something so I get myself to rest by writing stars and drawing, reading, going to any around mother house to help with our animals. And when he finally comes I didn’t even get it. Milk @DATE2 so I had to wait even longer within I guess on sit that was to do you just have to have mind on the thing you have to be patient about it.

I was patient one time, really patient but kinda went like this. It was @CAPS1 and my mom a I went shoping for presents. So my mom and I went to the mall and walked into target, and I already knew what I was going  to get my brother, the new game @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 it was perfect. But my mom wouldn’t let me buy  so I just bought him a target gift card for @MONEY1 i had to hide it for almost a month, but i really wanted to know what my mom got for my brother and I, but she wouldn’t tell me so I  had to be patient. And when @CAPS1 came I was so suprised because my mom bought @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 for me and my brother.
<START>

Once my friend @PERSON1 was very patient,he waited @NUM1  months for the xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. He quietly waited day after day for the game.But one day after school it arrived.

The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball she’ll just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited. My sister ended up getting so bored she just droped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, then when I was playing basketball again she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames.
<START>

When I had to go get my check up with my asma or and a familiar way like that when I had been waiting in the waiting room wich had tons of stuff to do if the doctor didn’t call your name yet. So I had gotton myself busy with crossword puzzles and looking at the fishes wich were awesome cause they had different kinds of fish. And then mostly I had read my book cause I am a reader at the same time a writer but I mostly I had read my book when the doctor came in finally to call my name but I was still busy doing activities then he had said he was sorry a bout  the wait which took a while and just said it had been fine and he seen all of the stuff I had been doing while I was waiting. And he said I was a very patient nice girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so I can get good compliment which makes me fell really good with a smile on the face. And ever since I see that exact doctor who I had do appointment with he always give me a treat or sitters. But to me it doesn’t matter as long as I am treating other people fair usually great. Because people would love to be like you one day for having patience.

When my mom, @PERSON1 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was really fun. @CAPS1 because I wanted a lot of stuff that my family couldn’t afford, my mom was very patient. I guess she’s just naturaly patient. I just don’t know how she does it. Anyway, throughout the entire store, it’s pretty big. It’s two stories tall! My mom a little angry with me because I kept on getting mad at her. @CAPS1 even though she got really angry with me, she tried to do her best to not show how angry she was in the store @CAPS1 by the time we got home I was so tired, I could’ve slept for a whole two to three days! We got everything that we needed that night when we went to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day we had to put up our night stands. @CAPS1 I really wanted my dad to put up our new bunk bed. @CAPS1 my mom said that he might not get to it that day. I was almost literally hourding my dad to put our bed. @CAPS1 when the time came, I was fed @CAPS1 my mom was mad at me cause I wanted to sleep in my bed that night.
<START>

A time when I was patient was when @DATE1 we drove to @LOCATION1. It was a long ride. It was long because he had a nagshion that went the long way to six flag and to our hotel. I try not to complan and be patient because the ride was a daylong so that means sitting for almost a day! We were lost in @LOCATION1 for almost a hour going up and down looking for our cusion that were coming too. I had to search but there was no space to. I wanted to go outside and run, jump but I hade to be patient. It was @NUM1 in the morning and I was tird. We still had to look for our hotel which was taking for ever! At the hotel I was unpacking my stuff and notice I was patient for almost a day which I though I would never be able to do in a car. That was the time I was being patient.
<START>

Not long ago I went to the pumpkin patch with my mom, sister, grandma, aunt, uncle my @NUM1 year old niece and baby cusin. When we where done, we went to a restaurant to eat. After @NUM2 minutes of waiting for the waitress, she comes over just to tell us she will be with us “@CAPS1”. So we wait for half an hour just to put our drink orders in. When we finally got to order our food it took them an hour to bring it.
<START>

Will I was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that farthers day morning in @DATE1 I was so exicted. I’m not a very patient person so when it came to this it was so hard to sit still. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard but when she was in my arms it was the must ama-zing feeling in my life. it’s always hard having to leave her when she’s calling your name it’s like I want to cry. I don’t always get to come home to a little girl saying my name but I love every minute I do. I always patiently wait to see her again but it is hard if you know what I mean.
<START>

At the @CAPS1’s office. I had an @CAPS2 appointment. At the @CAPS2 office I was waiting in the room for her to come back. Then the @CAPS1 asked me questions and my foster mom question. Then she left out she went an found the othere @CAPS1 and talked to him. Then they came back and said @CAPS4 you. here goes the papers you need. The foster mom said ok @CAPS4 you. Then the @CAPS1 said to me, “@CAPS4 you for being patient @PERSON1. I apprisiate that so much,” “@CAPS5 to I’ll see you guys next time ok.” @CAPS5 we said “bye.”
<START>

Patient people are the people that tolerate life. If you’re not patient you won’t get through to welI.I learned this when I was little. There was this thing I wanted and I was going to drive me, but just before I got out the door, the phone rang. My @CAPS2 picked up, “@CAPS1 oh hi @PERSON1 no not busy @CAPS6 did not! no!” and it went on for so long and every minute I kept getting less and less patient, I finally burst out. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “hold on @PERSON1 I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and walked away. That’@CAPS4 why patient is important
<START>

In the @DATE1 time my mom had planned of trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. We were on our way is airport and there was?? trying to work through traffic but we could not. So my mom starting yelling and l told her just calm down we will make it. So finally we got to the airport and there were a lot of people so we had to rush finally we made it to airport and l taught my mom to be patient and you will get were your going. So finally we made it to @LOCATION1.
<START>

A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office I had to get six teeth pulled. When we where waiting I keep asking my mom "when are we going when are we going." When the said "@CAPS1" i waked into the room. I asked if i was going to hurt and they said you won't fell a thing." The doctor put a tube on my mouth and said close your eyes and breath. with out even knowing I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours and when I wanted to get out of the chair they said "no, no, no" so I sat and sat until @NUM1 minutes later they let me out I was all loope and had to be put in a wheel chair. When I got to the front desk they let me take two toys and my mom gave me wresteler. When we where about to leave my mom talk to the doctor and they took for  ever. When we got in the car my mom took the wheel chair back and we where off. during the ride my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day cause of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror but I did and it was grass. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks d so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat I was happy. I am still patient cause the doctor said that grawn up teeth would come in a few months but it has been two years and nothing so I am disappointed, but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get bcacies which is gonna hurt really bad.
<START>

On a fine @DATE1 day I was heading toward the @CAPS1 office. I wasn't pleased. I didn't want the son to get there. But it did. When we got inside, my mom went to the checkin lane I just sat down. When my mom got done she sat right next to me and we waited. And we waited and waited. We waited for about @NUM1 minutes until the @CAPS1 came and called us in. Right when we get into his office a nurse came in and checked my temperature, heat beat, ex. When she was done and left we waited and waited. We sat there for @NUM2 minutes before the @CAPS1 came in. when he was done we checked out and left and @CAPS2 don't have to go there again.

One early @TIME1 in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 for a @ORGANIZATION1 skating competition I completed. I was waiting to hear if I made it to the @DATE1 part of the event. I had completed in. it was seven in the @TIME1 when we left the rink. We went get a bite to eat and went back to the rink when we were finished. My best friend @PERSON1 also was in the same event I competed in. I knew she would make it to the @DATE1, but I didn’t know if I would or not. After a endless wait they were about to call out the people who made it. I kept saying over and over again in my head my number I was given.  They called @PERSON1’s number. I was waiting for my number to still be called, but they never called it. I had not made it. I was disapointed, but I couldn’t do anything about it.
<START>

@CAPS1, @CAPS1 is a huge past of life to be ?? While you have problems and obstacles that makes you a good person. To have @CAPS1 it ??? to ???  to get the job done that has a long process you might have to wait for an example I have to have @CAPS1 all the time. for like football, hockey and all the active things I do you have to have @CAPS1. As you know adults probably have any more @CAPS1 than teenagers like myself.  like if I were to sit in my blind with my father all day! Like he does it never does happen. Now when I become more grown up and an adult I’ll hopefully have way more @CAPS1 and be able to sit in the blind all day with my father. I also do have to say I’m getting better with @CAPS1, because my dad preaches and preaches to me about @CAPS1, @CAPS2 hopefully when I’m an grown adult I’ll be able to have some good @CAPS1 like my dad.
<START>

To say really I’m not a very patient person, but once I was, I don’t really know how. I was waiting in line to pay for some earphones. I loved those earphones they were blue my favorite color. So I was waiting @NUM1 minutes passed then @NUM2 then I lost track of time but I knew it was a long time. Then the cashiers were having trouble with the registers. So I waited longer and longer until some people were trying to fix it. Then I had to wait even longer. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour. I really loved those earphones but as much as I wanted them I just couldn’t wait any longer. I “@CAPS1” and put the earphones aside and left the store. I was really mad that day. Two weeks later we came back luckily the earphones were just where I put them. Yesss!!
<START>

One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside this talking to each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said “yes”. So I went and packed some things to take because they don’t have anything. So when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio and was all fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub. I was fine until I got a test saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad but my mom this kept her eyes on the road. I was keep on screaming and saying mom go faster, but she this ignored me. It was like it went through one ear out the other. Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said “I don’t know” of course my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a bad @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didn’t listen. So then I was going to ignore her. That didn’t work because she didn’t talk. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said “why”. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer didn’t reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back “here”. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I don’t know why she didn’t talk. Maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient.
<START>

Awhile back my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called "@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2". I had just taken a great sniping position. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, @CAPS3 usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aim my weapon and fired, @CAPS4 to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, @CAPS3 I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1 @CAPS6 I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my weapon from the ground the person was gone. This made me pretty made seens how I waited @CAPS3 long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was looking my patience and getting frustrated. "@CAPS7 anyone even out here?" I whispered "@CAPS8! I got you @CAPS9!" someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He   was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. This whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one.

One time I was getting a cool @CAPS1 game it was sooo awsome. And my mom said we will get it on fri. It was @DATE1 and was soo part for her to get of work. And she got home and said we well go on stater day. I was a little mad. Bat how cares.But yea we got the game on the next startday I could’t believe  i was patient

A patent person in my life is my mom. Aicason my mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events. Soccer practice friends home and other places if I need to go there. Also she spends money on our soccer, our hobbies and other things we need or sometimes want. She is never certain and is always kind when were sad or anry and takes lot of time to do stuff for us. Also whenever were havinn trouble in school she helps us study, an example of most of these events would be that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year and thats not including additional things like gear, uniforms and team stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour even has to driving me and my brother places like cross country, soccer and basketball she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I needed help with a test she stayed with me for corily @NUM1 hours. Also whenever I do bad in school she just encourages me to do better but still is a little discouraged because she wants me to do good. She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals in conclusion my mom is one of the most patient people I know.
<START>

A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very very busy. She was the president of a club named @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about one or two years. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either position, she wasn’t earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things. She couldn’t find a job that was right for her. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didn’t enjoy.

I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. They’re so boring. Especially the @CAPS18 long weddings that take like two hours of people  just standing there on the after doing  nothing  I’m not the most patient person, so that’s probably why I hate long wedding. Now that is one long ‘story about patience. “Do we have to go?” I moaned to @CAPS4 mother. “@CAPS1 its @PERSON1’s wedding and it’s important.” “@CAPS2.” I had to surrender as I put on @CAPS4 new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the wapin @LOCATION1. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam. “@CAPS3 on!” @CAPS4 sister yelled. I just kept quiet. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, dramatic event just shot out. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to @LOCATION1. When we got a call from @CAPS4 grandma. “@CAPS5?” @CAPS4 mom answered. “@CAPS7 are you? The ceremony just ended,”  “@CAPS8. That’s bad. We’re in @LOCATION2, why? Has the reception @CAPS9 yet?”  “@CAPS10, but I’m sure you’ll make it in time to be there,”  “@CAPS11. That’s good. @CAPS12.” “@CAPS12.” @CAPS13, as if on we, he reached the reception. I was so happy to be there even if I do hate weddings. “@CAPS14 you have @CAPS16?” @CAPS4 mom asked as we arrvied home. “@CAPS16? I asked.” @CAPS17, I guess I @CAPS14, even the car ride was kind of @CAPS16.”  “@CAPS18? You tend not to be the patient type.” “@CAPS1” I said and I was proud.

A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by or the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table. At the garage sale I had a lemonade sale. Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty god! We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate. We hadto do a whole lot of work but I liked it a lot!

 A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON2 who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure. I started &lt;@CAPS5 knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS1 sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom&gt;. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS5 @CAPS5&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.             FIN

 Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @CAPS2. Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have.  Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was my team name, I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team, I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team.  As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly and I wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said "ready or not here we come". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt.  As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by I saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the @CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field they all grew a smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS2. I have had great memories with the @CAPS2, but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships; therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people.

 Some people like making people laugh, I love it. I will do most anything to get a good laugh. I will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of "special" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still at the tender age of five I loved making people laugh, and being special I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. For example one time I hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures and I wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how "special" I was (I got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street I fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm "special", and that I'm a complete spaz I can get on with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. Surprisingly I have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgies). That day is what this whole story is about, it's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm "special", and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when I would get into the story and lose my guard I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. The story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. The story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a "special" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  To this day I still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course I can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, I'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember, being "special" could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh.

 "LAUGHTER"  @CAPS1 I hang out with my friends, the one thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh about is running into trash cans, laundry or maybe even about what we ate for dinner the @TIME1 before. @CAPS1 I am usual stressed out the one thing I love is to hangout with my friends. they usual are good listeners. overall. Though they take your mind off things. So with my friends you can count on having a great time no matter what the occasion is.    @CAPS1 I say trash can I really mean trash cans I remember this one time in the hall way at school my friend was hanging on to my back pack because she tends to loose me in the hall way a lot because I walk a lot faster then her, anyways the class bell had just rouge an all the student were heading to lunch we were. I was just getting ready to cross the hall way an she said don't do it, so I did an nobody stopped! so she kinda slide into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hall way, she @MONTH1 have knocked it off but I can't really say? I was still walking an the sound effects were so funny I laugh at it still.       My friend an I have a inside joke? we went out to lunch together. @CAPS1 we saw a laundry mate an I minds went crazy, we made up a funny joke an said that we should make our self's aprons with lots color and rhinestones, so that way if we wanted to get all of our laundry done at the same time. We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS1 our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.  Now about the food its sort of like the laundry but I guess better? I remember @CAPS1 i came to school the next day i just started talking about what i had for dinner @TIME1 i think at that time my mom had asked us if we wanted chicken @PERSON1 an my sister as i screamed an said hell yeah? so dinner was ready an @CAPS1 we went to go site at the table we looked at it an it was not what we expected it to be? it was frozen out of a box an it looked like somebody had eaten the food than puked it back up? it was that great looking.    All of these thing that have named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @CAPS1 there not drama i love my friend I don't think I could have asked for a better one because all we do is laugh an have fun an fun in to trash can locker an whatever else there is but the one thing that matter the most with my one friend is that @CAPS1 we get in to a fight we can not stay mad at each other well I now that I can't. So at the end of the day I ask her are we done being made at each other? an than we just look at each other an laugh because that about all we can do because the reason was so stupid there was really no need for it.that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us. but just to have fun an be silly. not anybody else but are self's an sometime @CAPS1 we have are really goofy days? we make up the story about our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than to laugh because deep down inside you an your friend will look back an say wow those where the best day was @CAPS1-would would get in trouble in class for talking way to much.

@CAPS3 I'm going to tell @CAPS18 a little story. I remember a time when @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I decided to make a snowman at @CAPS11 house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I say to him, I'm bored, @CAPS1 do @CAPS18 want to do?" @PERSON1 replies,"@CAPS2 go make a snowman." @CAPS3 I agree that that would be fun. @CAPS34 starts reaching for a jacket @CAPS3 gloves, but I stop him @CAPS3 say," @CAPS1 are @CAPS18 getting those for?" "@CAPS5's not cold @CAPS20." "@CAPS6," replies @PERSON1. "@CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18."   We start our snowman by building the base (The biggest piece for the bottom). @CAPS3 after about @NUM1 minutes the base is almost done, but we notice that we're getting cold. "@CAPS7 we should go inside?" @PERSON1 says. "@CAPS8, I @CAPS7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate." @CAPS9 off we go back inside hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate. I see @CAPS11 mom @CAPS3 ask, "@CAPS10 we have some hot chocolate please?" "@CAPS11 @CAPS18 look cold, Of course I'll make @CAPS18 some." @CAPS9 @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit downstairs waiting anxiously for our hot chocolate by the heater to get warm.   "@CAPS5's ready!" @CAPS11 mom calls from upstairs. We fly down the hall @CAPS3 rush up the stairs. @CAPS3 to our amazement we find not only hot chocolate but a bag of chips as @CAPS28. "@CAPS14 mom!"I say. "@CAPS14 @CAPS16 @CAPS17!"says @PERSON1. "@CAPS18're welcome boys"says @CAPS11 mom. @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit down at the table @CAPS3 start drinking our hot chocolate, while @CAPS11 mom puts some chips on paper towels for us. I start eating the chips by the handfuls whereas @PERSON1 grabs one, just one. I ask him," @CAPS19 did @CAPS18 only grab one @PERSON1?" @CAPS20 of the corner of his eye @CAPS34 looks at me @CAPS3 slowly brings the chip to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. As @CAPS34 did that I fell @CAPS20 of @CAPS11 chair in a fit of hysterical laughter.    @CAPS11 mom hears the thump of me hitting the floor @CAPS3 runs upstairs to find me laughing. "@CAPS1's @CAPS9 funny?" she asks. I say to @PERSON1, "@CAPS22 her." @PERSON1 then complies @CAPS3 grabs another chip @CAPS3 while @CAPS34 looks at her from the corner of his eye, slowly brings @CAPS5 to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. I start busting up laughing again, yet @CAPS11 mom doesn't see the humor. She simply asks," @CAPS23 is that @CAPS9 funny?" @PERSON1 replies," I have no idea but @CAPS34 just about died from laughter. I start to stop laughing @CAPS3 I'm able to stand up again. I then tell @CAPS11 mom," @CAPS5's the way @CAPS34 looks at @CAPS18, @CAPS5 just makes @CAPS18 laugh."   I then @CAPS35 to do the same thing, but with no effect to @PERSON1. "@CAPS19 isn't @CAPS5 working?" I ask. "@CAPS26 I'm awesome like that @CAPS3 @CAPS18're @NUM2 says. "@CAPS6, @CAPS28 I'm gonna keep at @CAPS5 until I get @CAPS5 right." @CAPS9 I @CAPS35 to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I made happen was I spilled @CAPS11 hot chocolate all over myself, which made him laugh, albeit not the way I wanted to. "@CAPS18 want me to @CAPS22 @CAPS18?" @PERSON1 says. "@CAPS31!!!! Please!" I beg. "@CAPS6, @CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18." @CAPS34 proceeds then to grab another chip @CAPS3 while looking at me from the corner of his eye, bites the chip. I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS3 without pause. After about @NUM1 minutes I stop laughing.   "I'll get that right!" I say. @PERSON1 says,"@CAPS35 @CAPS5." I grab a chip @CAPS3 look straight at him @CAPS3 bite down, nothing. I @CAPS35 again, this time while looking at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye, nothing yet again. I @CAPS7 to myself, "@CAPS36 I @CAPS33't get @CAPS5 this time I'm giving up." "@CAPS6, here goes." I grab a chip @CAPS3 slowly bring @CAPS5 to @CAPS11 mouth while squinting at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye. I bite the chip. I notice @CAPS34's laughing. @CAPS34's laughing!!! "I told @CAPS18 I'd get @CAPS5!" " @CAPS31, @CAPS31 @CAPS18 did." @CAPS3 this is one of the many times laughter brought @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I together."

 My best friend, @PERSON1 and I have been close ever since we were @NUM1. We met through @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lessons at our local dance studio. We've stayed close throughout the years because we've always done similar activities. We're very different from each other though. I'm more out going, I like to speak my mind and I'm more carefree. @CAPS4's the opposite. @CAPS4's very conservative and @CAPS4 can take things too seriously. But either way, we manage to even each other out. Finals week had just gotten over, and @LOCATION1 and I had been planning a sleepover all week. We just needed time to relax and have some time to ourselves. When I had gotten home from school, I gave her a quick call. "@CAPS3?" @CAPS4 answered. "@CAPS5, @CAPS12 time did @CAPS16 wanna hang out?" I asked. "I was thinking @NUM2?" "@CAPS6 good!" I quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and my blanket. I put my shoes on and headed back out the door. My dad dropped me off with all of me gear. I had brought my pajamas, my pillow, and an extra blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked, and waited. Only seconds later did @CAPS4 answer it with a big smile across her face. @CAPS4 lead me down to her basement where @CAPS4 had all the junk food set out ready for us to attack. @CAPS4 had gone to the store earlier that day and had bought everything. @CAPS4 had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used. There were chips, cookies, sodas, candy, chocolate, and pizza. I set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we could eat all the food. We simply weren't big enough. After eating for almost an hour straight, we laid on her basement floor trying to gain composure. We started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen @CAPS7. Eventually, we got to talking about how each of our finals went. "I did soo good on all of mine! I'm gonna get ALL A's" @PERSON1 bragged. @CAPS4 has gotten straight A's every year since middle school. "I think I did pretty @CAPS8 too, not so sure about a @NUM3 though." I said as I was laying upside down on the floor. "@CAPS8, we'll just see tomorrow!"  We finally decided to move ourselves over to the couch on the opposite side of the pool table, so we could face the @CAPS7. It was already @NUM4 in the @TIME1 and we were still on a sugar high. We switched back and forth from watching some old scary movie, and the top @NUM5 music videos of the week. That had passed some time and before we knew it, it was @NUM2 in the @TIME1. @PERSON1 and I were laying on opposite ends of each other. Occasionally, one of us would get some chips or candy from the table. We grew tired to the point where we couldn't keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep fast. When I woke-up the next @TIME1, @PERSON1 wasn't laying across from me anymore. @CAPS4 was sitting in the corner chair where I had set my stuff. I looked at the clock, and it was already @NUM4:30 in the afternoon. I looked back and @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 seemed somewhat upset. I shifted around under my blanket so I could face her. "@CAPS5..." I grunted, while I was stretching. "@TIME1." @CAPS4 said abruptly. @CAPS4 was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand. "@CAPS12's up?" I asked, sitting up on the couch. @CAPS4 crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I picked it up from my lap and unfolded it. It was her report card. I scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades. @CAPS4 had received all A's... and one @CAPS13. @CAPS4 had gotten a @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper to see her hands covering her face. I walked over to her kinda amused by how upset @CAPS4 was.  "@CAPS16 got a @CAPS13... and @CAPS16're crying?" I asked. @CAPS4 looked up at me quickly. I looked at her with a stupid face, and @CAPS4 busted out laughing. @CAPS4 felt so stupid for crying over @NUM8 @CAPS13. I stared laughing too. I knew my grades we be far worse. Heck, I'd be glad to get @CAPS13's. @PERSON1 and I are the perfect best friends. We even each other out. I tell her to lighten up, and @CAPS4 tells me to focus more. @CAPS16 can't take little things like that too seriously, it's just not worth the stress. Sometimes @CAPS16 just gotta relax, and maintain your focus. @CAPS16 have to find your perfect balance of work, and play.

 I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness.

 Laughter, one of life's greatest gifts. Have you ever laughed so hard that you cried? What about laughed so hard you can't breath, or noise no longer escapes from your lips? I am the type of person that can @CAPS6 at something so stupid that when I get done laughing, I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can @CAPS6 so hard that nothing comes out at all! @CAPS1's amazing what laughter can do to a persons heart. The way @CAPS1 makes you feel, the way @CAPS1 makes you act. @CAPS1's so contagious, and @CAPS1 happens all around us everyday. You are never too old for laughter, @CAPS1 happens to the best of us. young or old, @CAPS1 doesn't matter. Laughter has no age limit. One time @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I stayed up until three in the @TIME1. We were so delirious, and kooky, we acted like crazy people. Now we have the type of relationship where we can @CAPS6 at almost anything. Literally almost anything... As we were staying up, we drank lots of soda and had sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We made up songs, we danced around @CAPS2 house, and @CAPS1 felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears were flowing out of @CAPS2 eyes, and i couldn't get a breath out of @CAPS2 heaving lungs. When @CAPS1 gets to the silent laughing, @CAPS1's even more funny because that person can't control @CAPS1, and they look so hilarious because there rocking back and forth, with this silly expression upon their face, not making any noise at all. Have you ever just laughed for what feels like a lifetime? How did you feel after that "lifetime" of laughter? @CAPS1 almost feels as something as powerful as the sun just warms over your heart and soul. When I @CAPS6 I feel all the happiness and emotion just flow all throughout @CAPS2 entire body. @CAPS1's one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a greater feeling than the warmth that laughter brings. @CAPS1's so great when you and a @CAPS3, or group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even when your feeling down, maybe need some cheering up. You can always depend on a @CAPS6 to pull you through. No matter what mood I'm in, @CAPS5 I hear someone laughing, @CAPS1 is so hard to not join in. Laughing is so contagious! @CAPS1 effects us in our everyday life's. I bet you that, you cannot go one day without hearing someone @CAPS6, or you not laughing yourself. I probably @CAPS6 about five hundred times a day, @CAPS5 not more. I love hearing people @CAPS6, @CAPS1 brightens @CAPS2 mood and also @CAPS2 day. I would most definitely say laughter is very important and beneficial for a relationship. I mean imagine the world without laughter. Boring, right? @CAPS2 advice, @CAPS6 like you heard the funniest thing in the world. @CAPS6 like there is no tomorrow. Who cares @CAPS5 people thinks its dumb. You'll feel much better after you have that tear-induced, hard to breath, silent but oh-so therapeutic @CAPS6. Laughter really is the shortest distance between people!

 Laugher Laughter is to express delight, fun, or a object of a joke. Laughter is something we all do, its a large benefit in our life and it happend on a everyday scedual. Without laughter we couldn't express our happy, out going side, we would have no particullar feeling in life except for frowning, which is a proven fact to cose more wrinkles beacuse of how many more muscles it uses.  For me laughter is a all day thing, @CAPS1 show, my friends, family and, horses are my number one reason for my frown to be tured up side down. You @MONTH1 think horses cant smile, or talk but @CAPS2 do have their own ways of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @CAPS2 are all smart, but @CAPS2 can be clutsy or goofy at times. Mostly @CAPS2 all just make you laugh and giggle like your own little brothers or sisters.  There is this one time that I will always have locked away in the back of my mind. It took place on a @DATE1 mid-day at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses saddled, ready to go. Both us and our horses felt the energy rush when we saw the waves pouning at the shore with the salty smell in our noses.  Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind wistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses heads were equaly pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced arounds like yearlings again, @CAPS2 would walk tell into the water tell it was drenching us both then soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'ed swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore.   After about five hours of adventuring caves, sand dunes and starfish we were all worn out, then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying "thanks for the good time". Driving home I knew this was a perfuct day because of the laughter, and of all the times I just laughed for the injoyment, also my face did hurt a little from smiling so much.

 Starting a story out with two @NUM1 @DATE1 old boys named @ORGANIZATION1 can already be considered a comedy. Those are the names of my identical twin cousins @ORGANIZATION1 I can honestly admit that they are @NUM2 of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the most intelligent human on earth, @ORGANIZATION1 by the way he named his children it's apparent that his sense of humor is a little bit off, but he's a really hard working man. Occasionally my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be a handful. Weekends are specifically better to have them over because of my hateful step siblings whom hate me, my brother, my sister, @ORGANIZATION1 even my mom. The amount of tension in the house isn't a healthy amount, so a couple of @NUM1 @DATE1 old running around livens it up a little @ORGANIZATION1 makes us all laugh together as a family. It must have been @DATE1 in @DATE2 when @CAPS7 was home @ORGANIZATION1 we were building onto our house when the twins came over. My mom was getting quite furious at their insanely high energy levels, she appeared to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My step dad @PERSON1 needed to go to @PERSON2's for nails @ORGANIZATION1 child locks @ORGANIZATION1 I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would have been a great idea to take the twins with us, just to relieve my mom of the loud mouths for a few minutes. We loaded up the car @ORGANIZATION1 I drove down the highway, amused with the twins in the back seat playing with the ponies @ORGANIZATION1 laughing at the people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like twinkle twinkle little star, @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION2's until we arrived in the @PERSON2's parking lot. @ORGANIZATION1 finds it pretty hilarious to run down the isles @ORGANIZATION1 hide behind items on the lower shelves, while @ORGANIZATION1 enjoys pretending he's @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 getting @CAPS7 confused. Eventually the twins were being too obnoxious, resulting in @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 me catching them @ORGANIZATION1 holding them as captives in the seat-belts of the @PERSON2's cart. It was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued along on our adventure in search of the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 found them down isle @NUM4. There was a large man standing in front of our destination @ORGANIZATION1 when i say large I don't mean muscular, or tall... I mean he probably has a few too many @CAPS1 shows he watches daily, @ORGANIZATION1 maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long @ORGANIZATION1 sandy blond, he wore a dark purple @CAPS2 die shirt @ORGANIZATION1 slip on sandals. @ORGANIZATION1 apparently hadn't realized how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude fashion, especially when they can hear you. He said, "@CAPS3 cow @ORGANIZATION1 look at that lady! She's so huge!" @ORGANIZATION1 laughed outrageously @ORGANIZATION1 agreed. "@CAPS4! She's as big as our whole car!" I panicked a bit @ORGANIZATION1 tried to get them to be quiet, however the twins paid @CAPS5 attention to me, they were much more excited to see the man on the tall ladder next to me giggling @ORGANIZATION1 laughing along with them. They were quiet for a moment then @ORGANIZATION1 gasped @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed, " @CAPS5 she's as big as a fire truck!" The man turned around @ORGANIZATION1 glared at me; i apologized at least @NUM5 times @ORGANIZATION1 started to take the boys out of the isle when the man on the ladder hit a button to make the ladder move. I was walking behind the larger man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beeping sound, like that of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear @ORGANIZATION1 shouted frantically, "@CAPS6 run as fast as you can hurry! She's backing up @ORGANIZATION1 she's going to squish you on the floor!" @CAPS7 laughed, even the man they were making fun of, but i was so embarrassed that i just took them to the car @ORGANIZATION1 waited for @PERSON1. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to a word i said. @PERSON1 only took approximately @NUM6 more minutes before he came jogging out the door with the nails, the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store @ORGANIZATION1 i chuckled quietly until @PERSON1 hopped into the truck, then i started laughing profusely. When I returned home I told my mom what had happened, she laughed for a while @ORGANIZATION1 i laughed even harder @ORGANIZATION1 quite a bit longer than i had before. I went to sleep with a fairly massive headache that night, but i think it was worth laughing all day for.

I remember i met this beautiful girl name @PERSON1 to me she was not just a friend i knew i wanted to have a life with her and be with her people say love cant come true but turn that upside down cause its the other way around love doesnt go love comes from up above.

 People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes a you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says "laughter plays a big part in our relationship".  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, "@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how put a smile on my face". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once "@CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh. That's @CAPS2 makes our family relationship stick together, and other familys also.I finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship.

    "Laughter is the best medicine." The phrase almost everyone has heard before. But it'@CAPS20 true! I've had days when all I could think about was how @CAPS23 life sucked, or at least seemed to. The days when you feel like everything is going wrong, and nothing could make it worse... And that'@CAPS20 when one of @CAPS14 best friends will make me laugh. I'll laugh so hard I'm on the verge of @CAPS19 @CAPS14 pants and @CAPS14 eyes water. I'll laugh so hard no sound comes out, @CAPS14 sides cramp and I fall on the floor. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think that even if I was in a coma, they'd say something so funny that I'd sit straight up in the hospital bed and @CAPS21 laugh the huge belly laugh that sometimes escapes me.    There was this particular time when @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others. We staggered to @CAPS1'@CAPS20 house flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know how it is when you and your best friends @CAPS9 @CAPS21 @CAPS13 so tickled by each other? Those times when you glance at your friend and @CAPS21 as you've begun to calm down, you see her pinched expression from trying not to laugh, and you lose it all over again. If you've ever had the pleasure of experiencing these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how hard we were laughing.    Anyway, we stumbled into her house, trying to get serious, since we did have to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were starving after all that laughing, so @CAPS1 told @ORGANIZATION1 and me that we could get some cereal. @CAPS21 regular milk and cereal, right? There'@CAPS20 nothing @CAPS22 special about @CAPS4'n @CAPS5 (besides that it'@CAPS20 freaking delicious). But on that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I'd ever tasted, and I @CAPS6, @CAPS6, @CAPS6, milk, so that had to mean something. "@CAPS7 this milk is so good! @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8!" @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. "@CAPS9 you kidding me with this? What kind of milk do you buy?!" I blurted out. For some reason that milk was really extraordinary, and it was seriously blowing @CAPS14 mind. "@CAPS10, I don'@CAPS17 know. Two percent?"@CAPS1 looked at us incredulously, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. Her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter. Now whenever one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it @CAPS21 happened.    @TIME1, it happened. @CAPS1 peed her pants, and not @CAPS21 a little. It wasn'@CAPS17 @CAPS21 the idle threat rushed out, the "@CAPS12'mgoingtopee!" squeal. @CAPS13 no. She actually peed herself, and I still @CAPS16'@CAPS17 even remember what I said to make her laugh that hard. All I know is suddenly (scaring me half way to death), she yelled out, "@CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8 I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS18 @CAPS19! THERE'@CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24!!" I whipped around and saw @CAPS1, red-faced and open-mouthed, supporting herself against the counter. She looked like the freaking @CAPS26 @CAPS27 of @LOCATION1 all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tight, crinkling at the corners, a few stray tears escaping as she tried to hold in shrieks of (apparently) crippling laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I was totally straight out laughing at her; pointing and laughing @CAPS14 shoulder-shake laugh, and it only made her laugh harder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-type run down the hall to the bathroom, where @DATE1 was. @CAPS1, in her wet jeans and with a red, tear streaked face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly bewildered and amused with what @CAPS21 happened. So naturally, @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at the sight of her, in her comically delirious state. Who wouldn'@CAPS17 have?   The fact that we @CAPS16 always laugh at each other and ourselves is why I love @CAPS14 friends . It'@CAPS20 great when you have people that you @CAPS16 laugh about everything and nothing with. @CAPS1 is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and @ORGANIZATION1'@CAPS20 pretty clever when it comes to thinking of them. Personally, I love laughing, especially with (and mostly at) @CAPS14 best friends.

               "Laughter" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but @CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping @CAPS2 full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh @CAPS2 off with time and start new. @CAPS5 helped me realize, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."  @CAPS1 a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried @CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever @CAPS5 would joke around with me I would take @CAPS2 all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought @CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that @CAPS2 was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. @CAPS5 said, "@PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now." I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. @CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, "@PERSON1? Are you alright, @CAPS2's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad." @CAPS5 exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes @CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, @CAPS5 looked worried. @CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that @CAPS5 so desperately wanted to have with me. @CAPS5 told me about how they would @CAPS3 together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then @CAPS3. "@CAPS3? What? Why would you guys do that?" I questioned.  @CAPS5 replied, " @CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say." @CAPS5 helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can @CAPS3 off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."

 Laughter. A story about laughter is what you want to hear? Well my life is filled with laughter and smiling. Crazy I know! If it wasn't for laughing I would not have the six pack that I have today. Have you ever stopped to think about when one person can make another person laugh they usually become really close friends maybe even best friends? My boyfriend is my best friend. This one time my boyfriend and I were laughing so hard. My boyfriend is my life. I spend pretty much everyday with him, he is so amazing. Me and him well we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best best friend anyone could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, a lot can happen in one year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even move away from those relationships you just made. Me and @PERSON1 we are always laughing, at each other and at other things as well. We always have fun times with each other. It was a late @DATE1 @TIME1 and he was walking me home like he always did before. There is this field with extremely tall grass and we were walking right next to it. All of a sudden out of no where he acts like he is getting pulled into the grass. So guess what I did, I screamed as loud as I could possibly scream! Then he starts calling my name in a creepy voice telling me to come over to the grass. Out of curiosity of what just happened I start walking over towards the tall grass. When I arrived to the spot where he entered the grass he tells me "@CAPS1 I lost my shoe and I can't seem to find it anywhere!" @PERSON1 and I start looking everywhere for his shoe. We couldn't see anything because it was really dark, so we used our hands to search around for his shoe, "I found it!" I said. After we found the shoe we realized two hours went by. We were so tired we laid down in the grass to take and break and we both started cracking up with laughter because of how ridiculous it was that we spent two hours on something that was suppose to be a little joke! it was so awesome. When we finally got to our feet our bellies hurt so bad and were very sore. I have never laughed harder than that in my life. Every time I'm with @PERSON1 is the best time ever. We always seem to find a way to make each other laugh. Without best friends or even just friends you would probably find it hard to laugh. With friends you always have someone to laugh at and also laugh with. This is why i cherish my best friend @PERSON1 and all the happy and laughing times we have together, because you'll never know when the last time you'll see that person will be. I try to be as happy as I can and I try to always make people laugh because laughter is the best way of exercise.

 Laughter is a big part in my relationship. I feel so much more connected with a person if we laugh together. Laughing make's you feel great. You could be in a depression stage and either a friend or a family member could walk up to you and pacify you and make you laugh. If I had a relationship that had no laughter in it, I would leave that person as fast as I could. Some people think relationships are only about money and/or looks.People now and days don't last that long in a relationship. Back in the old days people would die together, and even in death they would have there graves right by each other. My boyfriends name is @PERSON1. We have been going out for four years now. He is a very funny, I love his jokes. Sometimes he doesn't even try to make a joke, but he does anyway. When we where first going out, I was throwing a birthday party and me, @PERSON1 and one of his friends went in the woods and hid from everyone else. When the others came to find us we jumped out and scared them. They where mad at us, but when night fall came we where all laughing about it together. My mom and dad don't really laugh together that much. They just go to @ORGANIZATION1 with each other and come home together. My dad loves to crack jokes now and then, but my mom is the kind of person who likes to laugh at the other people that gets hurt. My grandma is so funny. She try's to make people laugh and hurt them selves so she can get a kick out of it. All of my friends are funny. My best friend @LOCATION1 is the funniest girl I have ever known. She likes to dance funny and mock people that she doesn't like. When she works, she'll try to find something to make a joke out of, so she could bring it to me and almost make me pee my pants. @LOCATION1's relationship was very bad. She loves to laugh but her boyfriend hates making jokes. She tried to stick it out but things got worse and worse. The only thing he would do is sit on his bed or his couch and play video games, or watch wrestling. He would make @LOCATION1 clean his room and do the dishes. He has a one year old sister and he makes her watch her,clean her, and feed her while he was up in hie room playing video games. @LOCATION1 got so tired of it , so she packed her stuff and she left. She went to her sisters house. Now she has a funny boyfriend and they always laugh together. There can be a laughing relationship with animals as well as humans.Animals are the one thing that cant talk back or make fun of you. Animals are just like humans, but they cant talk and they have fur. My cat is the king of my house. His name is @CAPS1. He loves to follow me all over my house. I love to sit on the floor and watch him wrestle with all of the other cats.Every time I go into the kitchen he is always there with me, bagging for food. After he eats, he gets an erg of energy and runs all over the house. It makes me laugh. He will stop right in front of me and just stare at me, if I move then he will run away. Cats are cute but not all of them have the power to look into your soul like my cat. @CAPS1 has big eyes and his meow is so sweet and incessant. The funniest thing about him is how fat he is. He is a fat cat, but he is only one years old. So when I see him running all over the place it makes me laugh. My horse is the same way. His name is @CAPS2, and he is four years old. He is a crazy horse, but at the same time he is very funny. He try's to play with my other horses and get hurt because he bites them, so they kick him back. He has a blue eye, so I bought him for my purposes. Some people thinks horses are just a bill, but I think they are my family.

 Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case she is full of joy, and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her all that takes place is laughter, and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and when ever you put the shapes into the right slots it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh, and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON1, my nephew, and @CAPS2 brother. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughs harder then ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see laughter is happy, and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew is just one example. What makes you laugh and smile?
<START>

 Why is it that laughter can bring people so close together? Is it because laughing shows trust for one another, or is it simply because you understand each other. There many different kinds of laughter, like cracking a joke, or someone does something very embarrassing. The story that I will be telling is about how such a bad day for hunting turned into the funniest moments ever.   It all started in the @TIME1 when I woke up, and I had forgotten to put my wet clothes that were in the washer machine to the dryer. Now I had to dig through all my clothes up in my room and find camouflage clothes that weren't dirty, or were something that I could wear. By this time anybody would be in a bad mood, and trying rush to get out the door. When my buddy @PERSON1 showed up and was ready to go and I wasn't. I was rushing, and when you rush you are bound to forget something, and I had left my gun at the house. Five miles down the road I noticed that I had forgotten my gun, so we turned around and went back to go get it. Not only now we were late, we were speeding to the cabin for breakfast, @PERSON1 had the eggs so that we could make omelets. As we are racing down, we hit a bump in the road and everything, I mean everything hit the ceiling in the truck and then slammed to the floor. In doing this all the eggs broke in the egg carton, so now we had no eggs, and no eggs meant no breakfast.  Its about thirty minutes till shooting hours, and we are late showing up to the blind so that @PERSON1 and I can meet up with our other friends, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2. Finally we get to the blind right before sunrise and while we are getting all set up, a group of twenty mallards drop in unexpected and took off before we could get a shot off. Now were all thinking great their goes our opportunity to redeem ourselves from a terrible @TIME1. Only to find out that those ducks were the only ducks we saw all day.   At around twelve o'clock we gave up, and went back up to the cabin, but on the way up we got stuck in two inches of water in a truck. I remember thinking to myself, "@CAPS1 this is not really happening to us right now". So @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and I got out of the truck to push, and @PERSON1 stayed in the truck to drive. Their were many attempts to push the truck out, and finally on the sixth try we pushed the truck hard enough to get it out of the muddy water. Now the funny part, when we had broke the truck free @PERSON1 laid on the gas causing the truck tires to spin, and spray mud everywhere. When I saw the amount of mud being hurled everywhere I jumped behind @PERSON2 and used him as a shield from the mud. By this point @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 are @CAPS2 in a inch thick layer of mud from head to toe. You couldn't help but laugh, it was the funniest thing ever. @PERSON1 had watched it all through his rear view mirror and as soon as he was safe from getting the truck stuck again, he fell out of the truck because he was laughing so hard. Even @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 were laughing a bit too.  So when its a day when nothing goes your way or having bad luck, you never know what the day has planned for, in this case its one of the most memorable things I remember that happened that duck season.

 "@CAPS1 figure something out to do! I am really freaking bored!" @CAPS2 explained as all of us relaxed next too his dark blue @CAPS3 which was gracefully parked right out side of my house. The @ORGANIZATION1 was young and as young boys we needed something to do. Gears started to turn in my head! As i thought of a bullet proof plan that would be very funny.  "@CAPS4 I've got it!" I yelped. "@CAPS1 here it, I'm really down for anything right @CAPS21," @CAPS6 quickly replied. "@CAPS7 since @CAPS2 has car he can drive into town and buy some cheap saran rap then @CAPS15 back to the four way intersection right out side of my neighborhood and tie the rap around two of the trees on opposite sides of the street so cars will speed through it!" I quick explained as i ran out of breath. Bursts of loud laughter came from all directions were my friends were standing as I came to realization that this idea was golden. "I will drive and go get it, but does anyone got some money too pitch in!" @CAPS2 pounced as @LOCATION2, @CAPS6 and I, handed single bills to him.  " that's plenty! give me a few minutes then we can meet at the intersection right out side of @CAPS10's neighborhood." @CAPS2 said as he brushed everyone off his car and begin to dip out of my neighborhood. "@CAPS12 text me when you're about to get back!" I screamed to @CAPS2 as sound of his poorly maintained engine bellowed in the @TIME1 sky. Minutes flew by and the rest of us just sat down on the curb, talked, and waited for @CAPS2. Ring ting my custom ring tone for incoming texts sounded. My eyes quickly scanned the phone's contents and concluded that @CAPS2 was ready with the saran rap at the four way intersection.  "@CAPS15 on @CAPS1 @CAPS4 go! @CAPS2 is ready and so @CAPS1 do this thing" I muttered as i grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood. @CAPS6 trailed, as @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 brought up the back. i yelled once again to enhance the passe. @CAPS2's car lights lit up the @ORGANIZATION1 air as he made a blinking signal to express where he was to us. All four of us quickly jogged over to the drive way of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood to where @CAPS2 was parked. "@CAPS17 you @CAPS4 long enough," @CAPS2 explained. "well we are all here! so @CAPS1 go to the intersection and set this up!" @PERSON1 explained as the started too lead toward the intersection which was about fifty yards away. As we reached the intersection there were no cars! We all @CAPS17 to this opportunity and @NUM1 and @PERSON1 look out for cars!" i yelled as @CAPS2 and i began the process. Quickly i opened the saran rap and ran crossed the road, uncoiling the rap as i went. Soon as @CAPS2 and I were both on opposite sides of the street we both started to firmly rap the saran around trees we have already pick out. Once i pulled and inspected it finding that it was prefect i sprinted to a short fence that was a boarder for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. i was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. "haha this is prefect! i am made sure everything feels right!" I explained as we all gazed upon delicately hung rap than ran from both sides of the two way street. "@CAPS21 we must wait," @PERSON2 said as anticipation fell into place. Four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road. Since it was about @NUM2 pm most of the good folk of @LOCATION1 were sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car came out of @CAPS21 were, speeding and only @NUM3 yards from the great prank. "@CAPS22," i yelled as the car continued driving closer and closer. Boom! The car speed through the saran rap, then came to a screeching stop. Laughter burst out as the inspected target was completely in disarray. But the anger male driver hearing our laughing decided too leave his car and chase us! "@CAPS23 up," I screamed! We all @CAPS23 right as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late for @CAPS6! The anger man caught him as the rest of us all high tailed it for my house. As soon as we reached my house we all began too ask our self's what happened too @CAPS6! Suddenly out of @CAPS21 where @CAPS6 came running, as he @CAPS22 reached us we started too burst into laughter once again! The whole left side of @CAPS6 was dripping with soda! @CAPS6 would never tell us what happened that @ORGANIZATION1 although we could have guessed! As the @CAPS25 and long @ORGANIZATION1 rapped up we all called quits and hit the sack at my house. But laughter wasn't in short supply that @ORGANIZATION1 as we all fell asleep!

Interesting fly.It was the @DATE1 of this @DATE2,after a long @DATE1 with some crying @CAPS3 lots of goodbyes i was finally in the airport,waiting for my plane to @LOCATION1.I've been in that airport so many times...I love @LOCATION2 but it's always exiting to go in vacation @CAPS3 i @CAPS1 it with my parents pretty frecuency.Today it was different, this wasn't a vacation. It was going to be a whole year. @CAPS3 my parents weren't going to be there.Just think about being away from them @CAPS3 all my friends in @LOCATION2 for such a long time made my stomach sick. Expecialy because in @NUM1, i was going to be meeting my host parents that i never saw before @CAPS3 wondering if they were going to be normal people or a pair of complitely weirdos.Once in the plane i sat with a young girl that was in @LOCATION2 studing arquitecture @CAPS3 going back home for winter..when i was just going away from it.@CAPS2 asked "@CAPS1 you speak english" @CAPS3 i said "I try to" @CAPS2 laught,@CAPS2 looked nice,with a big smile,@CAPS2 was pretty too.We started talking @CAPS3 @CAPS2 felt how nervious @CAPS3 anxious i was.@CAPS2 asked me if i was ok @CAPS3 i told her that i was going to be a foreing stage studient for the next year @CAPS3 my concerns about it,like meeting people or missing home.@CAPS2 told me"you will be fne,dont worry about it..i wish i had that chance when i was your age"@CAPS3 then changed the subject.After a long conversation @CAPS2 started reading a magazine @CAPS3 i put on my music.When we were about to get @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 all sudenly screamed so hard that made me jump,we laugh for a long time @CAPS3 @CAPS2 couldn't even talk to me @CAPS3 explain why did @CAPS2 scream because everybody was looking at us @CAPS3 that made it even more funny @CAPS3 kind off embarazing too so @CAPS2 could not stopt laughing.Then @CAPS2 told me that the guy in the picture of her magazine went with her to highschool a few years ago @CAPS3 they were together for some time but since graduation they didnt know anything about each other.He was now working at a bank @CAPS3 making good money,really good money...@CAPS2 was going craizy talking to her self @CAPS3 asking why in the word @CAPS2 stoped talking with him.That good time with her,even if i haven't seen her again made me really happy @CAPS3 by the time we got off of the plane i was more confident @CAPS3 almost forgot about all the nervious that i was before.After @NUM2 months here,everything is going perfect @CAPS3 im sure that even if it was just a few laughs @CAPS3 not a really long time on that plane,when i go back @LOCATION2 @CAPS3 think about @CAPS4 i will think about her,@CAPS3 i'll count that moment as my first good @CAPS5 expierence.

 In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over "are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back "yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. "then why cant you not laugh?" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. "its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to" and I said "well why on earth would you do that?" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. "allright if you don't stop this" he said in a gental but strained voice, "im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, "my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. "@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh" he said and went on "like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked "why though? why would someone tease you, your nice" and he repled "because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again "then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me" he said "I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to" I said "really!?" with too much excitment. "yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak." I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter.

 These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, "friends", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,"friend", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody.

Friends are'nt always what we want them to be they arent always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh a friendship can become. I mean what is a friendship if there isnt those moments where you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit-ups. Ofcourse you @MONTH1 meet a friend like this and it @MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of @NUM1 and i was new to @ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks, well atleast thats how i felt. My homeroom teacher @PERSON2 @CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. What? @CAPS2, what is that. I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a "friend" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing.

  It was a normal bright and warm @DATE1 day, going into my fifth grade year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors that were around our age. One of those neighbors happened to be a boy. We could not find anything to do. It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun, so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS1 had made. He made it out of an old swing set seat and I thought my neighbor would really enjoy it.  We all headed into our garage to get it. My sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so I would be the one to get it. As I was in total concentration, stretching and reaching to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I had found out what happened. My sister pulled down my pants.. in front of our boy neighbor. I picked my pants up off the ground, looked straight at my sister, and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists. I ran straight to my room, crying all the way there.   My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups. She sat on my bed waiting for a half an hour, I didn't budge. She did not say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night I finally came out. My sister kept on apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was upset with her, that's all that mattered. The whole next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood. My @CAPS1 came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her. I thought in my head, " how could she be upset.." but I realized I had not treated her right, even though I wasn't happy with her.   After hearing what my @CAPS1 had said, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days. She told me that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke around like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone besides family. I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbor friend away, but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about.   Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time it is brought up, we laugh so hard tears role down our face. I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It is another memory that my sister and I share and can reminisce about. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to some one.

Making someone laugh is the best feeling to their soul, and it is one step closer to internal happiness. People might say that when feeling something good inside the body its when they know that they have done something right. I agree with this because it has happen to me; I was feeling down about something that I cant even remember but, when I felt the need to help someone do something I knew inside of me that I did something very special at that moment. It's amazing how you make someone laugh, and it doesn't matter where you are, you also feel happy. The one person in my life that has a great sense of humor is my mother. She is always in need of something funny.People enjoy laughing so much that it is if they were to take some sort of energy drink to make them not want to stop laughing. I hear people say that laughter is very healthy for a human soul, and it will also make the soul and body last longer. Laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much. It could be a great way to start a conversation with a person. Positive thinking leads to making good choices especially if happiness leads you on in life. By making someone laugh it makes the awkwardness go away. It is better to laugh then to be sad.Everyone has their addiction to something in which they need to depend on. My mom's addiction is laughing. She laughs at work and she especially laughs at the house whenever I'm around. Although, sometimes she feels down whenever something goes wrong. I hate seeing her like this, because it then makes me feel down. When she is feeling sad it is if there is nothing in the world that would make her cheer up. If one person is feeling depress, that feeling passes on to the next person closest to them. Eventually I get tiered of seeing my mom like this and in this situation I cant help it but to get up and start doing some ridiculous stuff to cheer her up. Some things that pop into my mind is that I can start dancing funny or tell a little lie that might of happen at school that I think will cheer her up. When there is an opportunity to make someone laugh I enjoy to put a smile on their face.My mom means the world to me just as I mean the world to her. We try to help each other in any way as possible. This one day she came home from work and my dad was sitting in the table reading the newspaper and my mom walks in, and notices that my dad hasn't made food yet she started to flip out on him. She thought that it was stupid of him to not make dinner for us. She was pretty angry at him for a period of time, so she started to make us dinner but she was doing it all wrong. She was mixing the spices in the wrong pan, I was going to let her know that she was doing it all wrong, but my dad was holding me back so that I wouldn't get her more angry. She finally finish cooking and served us our plates but we didn't wanted to eat it because she made the food out of anger and made it smell funky. My dad forced us to eat it because he thought that by eating the food it would make her happy, but he was wrong it only made her feel worse because my youngest brother didn't like it. I felt bad so I had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood to not be mad at my dad anymore. I turn on the @CAPS1 and changed the @CAPS2 to the music @CAPS2 and started to dance as if I were to have ants in my pants. Her lungs were about to burst because she was laughing so hard, and eventually she was in a good mood for the rest of the day.Everywhere I go I see people smiling and laughing about something and it only makes me wonder about the funny things that are being said. I think that it is a good thing for someone to feel good about themselves because it brings a positive feeling in the room. I enjoy to see people be happy because it always makes me feel happy. What better way to be happy when smiling is one step closer to laughing. My mom and I like to take walks just so that we wouldn't feel apart and stay closer to each other, we see different people each time we go walking and we always get a smile from them. That is the best feeling in the world, to feel joy is to be free from all your problems.

 "Laughter is the key to the soul." @CAPS1 you are having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, laughing can always make it better. I was sitting in @CAPS2 class one day, and was bored out of my mind. Then, a shy, quiet kid, all of a sudden started laughing! @CAPS3 couldn't stop! It was like @CAPS3 was on "laughing gas." @CAPS3 laughed so hard @CAPS3 couldn't breathe. Now this made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laugh. Soon enough the entire class was laughing! So even though some of the people in @CAPS2 class might have been bored, or had a bad day, the laughter was spread throughout the room, making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire, and it makes everyone happier. And when you are happier, you are healthier. So with that, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter in it, in order to work. When you ask someone what they like about there boyfriend or girlfriend, if it is a @CAPS2 relationship, they will almost always say, "@CAPS3/she makes me laugh." @CAPS5 when you don't have laughter in a relationship, you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh the more you can live a better life and enjoy life more. Have you laughed today?

 Their are many joys in life, some are more relevant then the others, and some are so obvious you'd be stupid no to notice them. Have you ever just sat on your porch or stared out the window just to watch the sun rise, as you sat there pondering your life and its unusual qualities, you think of all the great memories, all the laughs you have shared, all the sorrows, all the pain ,and all the love and hate. Its not surprising that almost everyone has done just that and they wonder if they could change things, how would they do that, or would they leave it the way it started out, filling their life is complete and they are complete as well, not having any regrets.  For all the tears I have cried and all the pain I've been through there has always been a laugh to top the sadness. some time I to sit and pander my life, although i have not lived long and my real experiences are yet to come, I have been through a great deal in my short experiences, but it does not trouble me, for i have taken in what has happened during my time period and I have learned a great deal form it. I've learned that no matter how hard you try you can never fully plain your life theirs always going to be something or someone unexpected, all you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Its not hard to be happy, just keep an open mind and a light heart, and soon you will find yourself laughing with the rest of the world and enjoying your short time on this amazing planet we call @LOCATION1, so listen to your mother and father or even the person you look up to most in life.  There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals, but the most important thing i can think of isn't just one thing its a collection of things, such as love, laughter, new beginnings and old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is take it) , the relentlessness of the universe, and the idea that there @MONTH1 be other planets out there that sustain life, maybe even intelligent life. Its easy to find things to live for and even easier to find things to die for, hopefully you look for things to live for. I remember when it was hard and I thought I would never ever be happy and I felt like I wasn't right for this world and its many confusing aspects. I was at the end of my path or so I was making it out to be, but then something happened as I sat on the side of an old road. I looked up at the stars and thought what would i miss out on if I ended my path now, what would I dare to name my child or children for that matter if I even have the chance to produce any.Who would I marry if i marry, will our love last or fade like morning due. so I finally decided that there was to much i would not experience if I ended it this soon. after that fateful evening I went about my life slowly molding into a better person who wanted a bright future with a romantically new but burning love story to tell to my child or children, and with devotion, trust,and respect would hopefully last. but that's not all I would want my adventure to consist of. I would want to find peace of mind in a place where silence is a scarcity, I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals not pushing them aside or abusing their natural right to be on this @LOCATION1 along side us, I want to solve the pollution problem that we humans have more then helped produce. i suppose in my small way i will because in just one person and a every small thing on this very big home of ours, but as small as I am what i do or say will make an impact. so if I want something to look back and laugh on i had bettered to what i consider my part and making this planet a shared and healthy planet.

A true story about how two close friends became friends over the joy of laughter. One year their is a boy named @PERSON1 who wanted to so something fun this @DATE1 ins ted of just staying in his room and playing video games all day. So he heard of a play called"@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1" from a friend and found out if he could join and help out with the play, but he ended up getting a part of the play and helped back stage when ever he could. @PERSON1 found that he enjoyed the doing the play very much and made a lot of friends. At the some time when @PERSON1 was having fun their was a girl named @ORGANIZATION1 who didn't talk much to @PERSON1 at all, but she liked him and she didn't tell a whole lot of people. @ORGANIZATION1 also tried to make as many friends as she could when doing the plays and spent as much time with her friends as she could. As the play stared to end @PERSON1 stared to hang out with @PERSON2 who is @ORGANIZATION1 older brother and stared to pay a little more attention to her and found out from her brother that she liked @PERSON1, but @PERSON1 already knew that she did like him from the way she acted around @PERSON1. @PERSON1 joined another play called"@CAPS2 in @LOCATION1" after doing"@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1" because of how much fun he had in doing the first play. @PERSON1 found he already knew most of the people form doing the first play. So he stared talking to the rest of the people that was their that @PERSON1 didn't knew already. This is when @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 stared talking to each other and both of them found that they enjoyed each others laughter they became vary close friends. they became such close friends vary fast because of how @PERSON1 like to make friends vary easy and @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't have vary many friends or close friends or it could have been the fact that @ORGANIZATION1 liked him so much. @ORGANIZATION1 didn't have vary many friends because the kids at school would make fun of her for being so smart and then she go home schooled and lost some of her only friends that she had. @PERSON1 soon found out in their friendship @ORGANIZATION1 was scared of of @PERSON1 not wanting to be her friend because of all the friends she had already lost. By the time that the play was starting to come to an end @PERSON1 had already noticed that @ORGANIZATION1 had liked @PERSON1 before they were friends and he asked her if she did like him she said no at first, but then she felt bad for lining to him and told him the truth about how she did like him and how she thought that is would be best if they just stay as friends. Both of them knew that they could only be friends because of their age difference. @PERSON1 was @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 was @NUM2. So they both knew that it would have never have worked out because of their age. So they both agreed that is would be best if they just stay as friends. As the play was ending the used every minute of it to grow their friendship. By the end of the play they both have became close friends and enjoyed the the good times that they had together and also enjoyed the laughter of one another.  Even after the play both of them still talked when ever they had the time to talk to each other, but they didn't get to see each much of each other. When they had the time to talk they talked about the good times that they had with one another and how much fun they had. They also talked about the great and fun that they had in doing the plays. Both of them agreed that they would do the plays again next @DATE1 and looked forward to seeing each other next @DATE1 and how many great thing that they will have to talk about. End the end I think that @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 are going the be friends for a long time. maybe when they get older they could be more then friends and have their friendship go to the next level......... only time will tell.

 I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 can. Just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first @CAPS6 someone is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you know @CAPS2 the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS4 happened in @LOCATION1, where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE1. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a hot place and the sun is usually out every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family. I remember @CAPS4 was a day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring with us @CAPS6 we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @CAPS6 I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. "That was funny wasn't @CAPS4" he told me laughing. "@CAPS1 @CAPS4 was. I didn't know you made jokes like that" I replied.  He kept on talking to me and then he said, "I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say @CAPS4 to hurt anyone."  I thought @CAPS4 was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION1 talk like that. We kept on talking @CAPS6 I started to laugh again. "@CAPS2 did I say now?" he asked. "@CAPS3. I was just remembering @CAPS2 you said in the beginning. That was really funny" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget of @CAPS2 he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think @CAPS4 was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought @CAPS4 was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least @CAPS2 I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparent and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION1 than where I live know because @CAPS4's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of @CAPS2 I had told him because he knows @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like to live in @LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how I's like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, @CAPS4 got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because @CAPS6 I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time @CAPS4 was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. "@CAPS6 did they leave?" he asked me. "I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time," I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if @CAPS3 had happened. @CAPS4 was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually liked making a new friend this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend over there and if I decide to, I can make other friends by simply laughing with them in their conversations.

 As I waited in the car, anxious to meet my best friend and man I'm in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, many many text messages, and countless emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my sanity.  As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got more nervous. @CAPS6 if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? @CAPS6 if he didn't like me? @CAPS6 if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away. I smiled back. "@CAPS1, @PERSON1," he said. "@CAPS1 @PERSON2," I said, butterflies in my stomach. I was smiling broadly still, he reached out and cautiously took my hand.  "@CAPS3 was the drive?" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand. "@CAPS4, and nerve wracking," I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again. "@CAPS5 your here now, and I'm very happy @CAPS7 are," he said, smiling. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was dreaming. Here him and I were two guys in love with one another, a new thing for both of us, and we were happy as can be. The whole car ride we held hands ad talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 all too fast and all of us got out of the car, I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half-hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table my mother, who was very happy I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with tales of my childhood. It was one of the most embarassing moments of my life. I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered, others I did not. @PERSON2 laughed and joked wth me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table.  After we ate dinner and dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store. My favorite book store, @ORGANIZATION3's. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed @PERSON2 staring at me. "@CAPS6?" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously.  "@CAPS7 just look very... In your element," he smirked.  "@CAPS8?" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. "@CAPS9 problem," he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. "@CAPS10 if I'm a little forward?" he asked. I shook my head @CAPS9. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew @CAPS6 he was thinking just by the look on his face.  "That felt fantastic," I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face.  "@CAPS11," he simply said, kissing me again. "I love your laugh, love," he told me, I was on cloud nine, I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! I'd never been this happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to @ORGANIZATION2. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. Both our gazes fixed our future together. Now whenever I remember that I was start to giggle happily to myself. Yes I get a stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. Making us the closest we've ever been.

 Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS12 we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS12 talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I most have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS12 showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits o laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS12 begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS12 stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON1 was @CAPS10 in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. i was even closer to @CAPS1 then in the first term. So, one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, "@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!" @CAPS10 even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS12 a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION2, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @CAPS12 said, "@CAPS11 you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me." @CAPS12 about five minutes afterwords, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12 with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS10 a science @CAPS13, so we were unable to do to many experiments. So @CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS14, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using the matches, because his nickname for me was @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS11 this happened, i was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS12 I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did so. So @CAPS11 I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so i got after him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS18 class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day, because she lvoed the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS11 he was done giving notes @CAPS12 giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embaressed, so he said to come after class @CAPS12 ask personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste classtime for silly @CAPS12 personal question about him. I thought the entire time, "@CAPS20 doesn't he just say yes or no?" @CAPS21 were fun times that I will never forget @CAPS12 tell the day I die. No class, or science class will ever replace fourth period physical science. Nor any teacher replace @LOCATION1, he is @CAPS12 always will be my favorite teacher. I will forever remember the days of every phsycial science class, because of that one simple teacher.

 Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS3 awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS3 embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone "cheese ball caroling" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE2, we go secret @LOCATION1 shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS3 going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking "@CAPS2 great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome." We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to "his" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said " @CAPS3 you going to sing or just stand there?" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second "happy birthday to you" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS3 all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of "what were you thinking" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it.

 Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM1 grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS2 and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?

                                   @ORGANIZATION1 blew my mind the first time I seen her. She was my other half. Everything we did together was perfect. She made me laugh with everything she said. She was my better half would sum it all up. I still remember when I first seen her in @CAPS1. The nickname of the town was @CAPS1 @CAPS4 hell because of where it was located, in the middle of nowhere. We met when I was on vacation at @CAPS1. My parents had just retired a few months before and were looking for a cozy retirement home away from the big city's and more closer @CAPS4 the good eastern @LOCATION2 mountains that seem @CAPS4 always have snowy tops and beautiful landscapes. We ended up staying there for a week or so in this little trailer that we took with us. That thing was hell on earth, every time we stopped I would have @CAPS4 set everything up even if we weren't going @CAPS4 use it. It was a two hour process and after the hundredth time you can see how I would get bored. looking for a great house @CAPS4 stay in that town was not hard @CAPS4 come by. They were all amazing homemade houses. Never was a contractor paid @CAPS4 build these houses because the men of the town made them by hand. They were incredible two story oak made houses that look like they could take a tornado coming out with only scratches. We ended up finding this one house that was so amazing that I wanted @CAPS4 live there right off the bat, surprisingly my parents wanted it @CAPS4. But the sad thing is is that we had @CAPS4 sell our house first or we wouldn't be able @CAPS4 afford it, so we put that house on the "@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6" and headed back @CAPS4 the trailer.  We had another @NUM1 days or so there and I was officially bored out of my mind. I needed something @CAPS4 do besides stock the fire and make sure the hot dogs did not burn. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town ( the trailer park was located about half a mile out of town). I arrived in town @CAPS4 be very disappointing. It was just as boring riding a bike around town and stopping inside the shop @CAPS4 make small talk just as sitting by the fire in @NUM2 degree weather. In my mind it was just another boring vacation but little did I know it was about @CAPS4 get a lot more fun. I woke up the next day and took my shower and got ready for the day. It seemed like another boring day in hell from what I could tell. @CAPS4 me fun was doing stuff I normally would not do. But back then @CAPS1 and places like that just did not cut it because all I did that @DATE1 was go @CAPS4 places like this and do nothing so it was expected of me @CAPS4 be bored. I rode my bike around a corner and I saw a bunch of guys and girls that looked like they just came from fishing or tubing or something fun, so I rode over @CAPS4 see what was going on. I started talking @CAPS4 a guy named @CAPS8. He told me they just got back from a youth group get together on the snake were they went tubing and cliff jumping. I was in aw. That seemed crazy @CAPS4 me. Cliff jumping? Tubing? It seemed way @CAPS4 crazy for a youth group. But I guess that's just how they do things in @CAPS1. They just don't go have a picnic they go do crazy stuff that I personally have not done any of the things they were talking about because for one i not crazy and for two I have never had the chance. We kept talking and before they all left they invited me @CAPS4 go on there nature hike up on top of this mountain. I was more than happy @CAPS4 oblige seeing as I love hiking.  I woke up in the @TIME1 feeling all hipped up and ready @CAPS4 rock. I had my permission slip signed and I was ready for a good ole hike. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town at five in the @TIME1 and arrived at the youth administrators house just in time for a protein shake for breakfast ( he offered it @CAPS4 me I did not ask). We drove @CAPS4 the mountain and at the base there were around @NUM3 @CAPS4 @NUM4 people all in hiking gear. It surprised me because I was not expecting so many people. That's when I met @LOCATION1. She was gorgeous so I was attracted @CAPS4 her immediately. We began the climb and I began @CAPS4 talk @CAPS4 her. We were like two pees in a pod. I couldn't get enough of her and her of me. Her laugh made me extremely happy. She was my other half. All I can remember is her amazing laugh.

                        `   THE @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 story is about how I fell in dog @CAPS1 and stepped in it, I fell off of a slippery trampoline.about four or five years ago I went too a friends house to stay the @TIME1. That day was a hot day so my friend and I devised a plan to have fun and stay cool, so my friend and I went to the garage and found the sprinkler, so we decided to put the sprinkler under the trampoline and when u do that it makes the trampoline wet and slippery. My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline and he was starting too jump higher then me and I started losing bounce and he came back down the same time as me, but he had more bounce, which made me bounce a lot higher then I normally could also he weighed more then me. So i came back down and I landed on my back and the angle I was at on the trampoline shot me off. As I was bounced off the trampoline I thought I was gonna get hurt and I had rather gotten a few scratches then landing on a dogs manure, but that's just what happen I landed on a pile of dog manure and it really stunk my shirt up so bad, but after i took my shirt off i started jumping again and i jumped for that whole day about but i don't regret it it because after that everyone had a good laugh including me. so @CAPS3 story was a part of laughter and how laughter is a great way to have fun and even when it @MONTH1 have been a bad thing that happen to you, maybe in the end it was funny even though at the time it was not.

 @CAPS9 you ever been scared so much that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party. It was called our "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" night, we call it "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" because, us @CAPS5 kids, we consider ourselves as @CAPS1. Our night involves @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be "@CAPS6".  To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. Everyone reached at my house around @NUM4 pm. We started out by playing videos games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed. Once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the "@CAPS7 or @CAPS8" games. I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version didn't you? Well, fortunately we are the @CAPS5 kids. Just your normal "I @CAPS8 you to run around the house three times" or "@CAPS9 you ever kissed someone?". Nothing unrated about that. After a while everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do which was to play sing-star on the @NUM5, but @LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords over so we couldn't hook the console up. Since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @CAPS1. Since this was our "@CAPS1 @CAPS2", it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @CAPS1. For our @CAPS1 role, it goes like this, I am the father, @PERSON3 is the mother, @LOCATION3 is the cat, @PERSON8 is the @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @CAPS13 and @PERSON6 were my children, @PERSON1 is my brother, @PERSON7 is the strange atrocious woman, @PERSON4 is the sister in-law, and @LOCATION2 is our cable guy. This is how we all considered each other in the @CAPS1, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering to each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot. After photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM6 different large pizzas. Hawaiian, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2, and @CAPS20. One by one, we all kept coming back for more. My "daughter" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. We all started to pother. @PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, and @PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life. After the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. Now it was @CAPS23 movie time. Snuggled up onto the couch with @NUM1 people all clutched together is the "right" way to contemplate a @CAPS23 movie. The movie we chose was called The @CAPS24. Every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then, that's when it all happened... when @PERSON4 got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS25 turned off, all the lights in the house shut down and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @CAPS13 started to cry, @LOCATION2 was complaining, @PERSON4 wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I was freaking out. Since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. Most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. There was one story that @PERSON6 portrayed about a possessed @CAPS26 that had no left leg and would go around terrorizing pedestrians. Well, it just so happened that I had a @LOCATION1 that had no left leg and when we started telling that story my @LOCATION1 started to freak out and assail all of my guests. So I grabbed my dog whistle and commanded them to cease, and dismiss. After all of the commotion, my parents never woke up and we all scurried up to my room to continue our discussion of @CAPS23 stories. During the whole process of the @CAPS2, the main lesson was that you can conquer any kind of fear as long as you @CAPS9 a sense of laughter and friends to back you up with it and that's what happened at the party. We were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter. By far I would @CAPS9 to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties I @CAPS9 ever had.

 Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to @CAPS11 is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in @PERSON1's seventh grade math class at @ORGANIZATION1, I was chosen to be in the @ORGANIZATION2 along with just three other classmates. Being in the @ORGANIZATION2 simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves @CAPS1-@CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @PERSON1 would teach the rest of the class an easier, more simple math. The @ORGANIZATION2 was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused @TIME1 incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the @ORGANIZATION2. Their names were @PERSON4, @PERSON3, and @CAPS3. @PERSON4 and I were already friends, but it was working together in the @ORGANIZATION2 that really brought us closer together. I also became close with @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3. To @TIME1 day, @PERSON4 is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. @PERSON3 was caught up in the popular crowd, @CAPS3 usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and @PERSON4 and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence.  We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing @CAPS8, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the order things played out in. "@PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math @DATE2. I'm beat," I complained as we walked into @PERSON1's room for math right after lunch. "@CAPS6 neither," she replied. "I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work." We made our way to the table in the back where @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. @PERSON4 and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. "@CAPS8 uh, I was talking to @LOCATION1 @TIME1 and he said that we don't have to do any work @DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out," I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 grinned. @PERSON3 turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind @CAPS6. @PERSON4 noticed and immediately started to chuckle. "@CAPS10, what's that?!" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. @PERSON1 and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. "@CAPS11 guys, I had @TIME1 crazy dream @TIME2," @PERSON3 said as the laughter died down. "I went to @TIME1 @DATE1 camp thing, and @PERSON2 was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about @TIME1, was that @PERSON2 often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were @CAPS8 desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, @CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, @TIME1 would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the @ORGANIZATION2. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We @MONTH1 not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other.

Many @CAPS1 to laughter People always say that laughing can have many benefits. The truth, I believe, is that laughter is not always the best thing. Laughing can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles,happiness, and memories. Although, there is one memory of laughter that does not prove that to be true. "@CAPS2, I really don't wanna be here. I don't know that I can stay here and tell him this," I pleaded to @CAPS11 mother to @CAPS6 me go back home. "@CAPS3 need to do this honey. @CAPS8's for the best." @CAPS4 that point I had always though @CAPS11 mother knew best. Now, I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back tears, waiting for @CAPS11 father to get back to his house. I knew he was at the bar, and silently thanked him that I had time to think.  I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way there. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at @CAPS11 drunk father and @CAPS11 heart dropped. I burst out in tears while @CAPS11 mother held me in her arms. "@CAPS5...@CAPS8's alright," she soothed. @CAPS11 father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man @CAPS11 mother had once married anymore. He had became a monster.  I couldn't stand @CAPS8 anymore. I walked into the room where @CAPS11 mother waited with worry in her eyes. "@CAPS6's go home," I said. On the way home I sobbed until @CAPS11 shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on @CAPS11 face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS11 @CAPS9 how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. "@CAPS7. Hey." @CAPS8 made me upset that @CAPS11 father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk.  "@CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel as though @CAPS3 are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know @CAPS10 addicted and there are risks with stopping but @CAPS3're also endangering @CAPS10 health!" I basically screamed at him. I poured out @CAPS11 heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @CAPS11 father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. "@CAPS10 mother told @CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @CAPS8. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 doesn't know what she's talking about." @CAPS11 jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious. Anger boiled in me.  "@CAPS3 don't even know me! @CAPS3 don't even care about me!" I screamed then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked straight at @CAPS11 mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave.  This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is almost always a great thing, I started to cry because, just once, laughing didn't mean happiness. @CAPS8 meant tears.

                          Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 "@CAPS5, we've got something to tell @CAPS3." I knew @CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that @CAPS8 they went into the other room, @CAPS6 wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce @CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words "We are getting a divorce," rang in my head like church bells @CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @CAPS3 could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS9 was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet @CAPS11 become one, @CAPS6 had turned red @CAPS11 irritated. @CAPS6 killed me inside to see her crying, @CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love @CAPS11 that @CAPS6 all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment @CAPS11 anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around @CAPS9 was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,"@CAPS6's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father @CAPS11 I." @CAPS7 did they think those statements made @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION1. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. @CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. @CAPS6 was broken @CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just @CAPS8 @CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I @CAPS1 never forget. "@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily." One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time @CAPS8 mom @CAPS11 I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS11 familiar. @CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives @CAPS11 mine.  I began to laugh, @CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,"@CAPS9's wrong, @CAPS10?" @CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That @CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, @CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. "@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh." The statement that said to me, @CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS1 be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If @CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.

 Laughter, the sense of pure happiness. You are in the moment @CAPS1 nothing else matters, all your worries @CAPS1 stress fall away leaving you with your true happy self. Have you ever had those moments when everything seem too much? Then a friend says something that makes you laugh, once your done laughing you start to cry because it felt so good to laugh. Or when you laugh so hard you fall to the floor @CAPS1 can't get up for what seems hours? Yet looking back you forget what was so funny. Laughter is magical, @CAPS7 behind love. Those two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just you boyfriend/girlfriend but you friends @CAPS1 family too, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, @CAPS1 that brings you even closer together. When I'm with @CAPS16 friends the one thing we seem to do most is laugh. We laugh about anything @CAPS1 everything that is even slightly funny. It bring us closer together, sharing a moment of joy. The six of us are very close @CAPS1 will be friends after high @ORGANIZATION1 is over, even if we go to colleges a thousands of miles away. It is because we have shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other @CAPS1 can share anything with them even our most important secrets. This story is how we came to be so close. Brightly colored fancy dresses @CAPS1 killer high heels were splayed out across the room. Open soda cans @CAPS1 chip bags. The faint smell of nail polish, flowery perfume, @CAPS1 deodorant lingering in the air. Laughter @CAPS1 giggles bubbling through out the room with the occasional squeal. Pitch black outside but light @CAPS1 warm in. Six of us lounging around the room. Smeared makeup @CAPS1 deflating hair. Sweat pants @CAPS1 baggy t-shirts. We all went from looking our very best to... not, within a few minutes. Yet not one of us cared. We when looking at each other we were able to @CAPS17 past appearances had fun with each other, not their looks. We had just gotten back from the @ORGANIZATION1. None of us had had dates but we still managed to have the time of our lives. "@CAPS1 did you see him! He was dancing with her!" "I wouldn't really call that dancing...." she made a pelvic thrust, we all burst into a new round of giggles @CAPS1 shouted stuff like, "@CAPS2, get a room!" We gossiped about what we saw, who was with who, pretty dresses, hot @CAPS4, creeper @CAPS4, slow dances, the music, even our @CAPS8 we hid our cups so we would know which one was ours when we wanted to use it again.We had all been friends, but recently we had been becoming closer. Starting to move from friends to best friends.  It was at least @NUM1 @CAPS3. Everyone was exhausted but was forcing themselves to stay up with caffeine @CAPS1 sugar. You @MONTH1 ask why, but I'm not really sure. Maybe because we always seem to have so much to talk about, because we enjoy each others company, or just because we can, so why not?"@CAPS4 I think we need a picture, a picture of the six of us." I said."@CAPS5!" "@CAPS6""@CAPS7 now? I'm a mess!""I've got just the thing!" @PERSON1 takes off running upstairs to grab something."@CAPS8 should we sit?""@CAPS9 the bed?""@CAPS10, @CAPS5! Scoot over fatties""@CAPS11! I'm not fat, I'm festively plump!" We all cracked up to the reference of @LOCATION1 as we stared to squeeze into a corner of the squishy full size bed. @PERSON1 @CAPS1 @PERSON1's mom arrive back into the room. @PERSON1 was carrying a old @ORGANIZATION2 camera that print out the picture immediately after you took it. She gave the camera to her mom @CAPS1 jumped @CAPS9 to the bed. We all squished together, barely enough room to breathe."One...Two...Three!" @CAPS12! the picture came out. "@CAPS13 take one more while the first is developing. Again, one... two... three!" @CAPS14! @CAPS12! "@CAPS15!!!" We all screamed in unison. The bed broke! we had broken the bed! We all sat there clinging to each other in total shock."@CAPS16 bed! You @CAPS4 are faaaaat..." @PERSON1 said while trying to contain a giggle. Suddenly we were in hysterics. Even @PERSON1's mom was laughing. We were one big throbbing pile of laughter. Only the corner of the bed had broken so we were all pulled down into that corner. Then someone started tickling, it was war. Every girl for themselves. It was a mass of bedsheets, wiggling fingers, bare feet, biting @CAPS1 a whole lot of laughing. "@CAPS17 the pictures have developed." The first one showed us sitting together smiling, but the second one was taken just as the bed broke. It showed the shock @CAPS9 our faces as we held onto each other for support. Not only did it bring us literally closer together but it started our amazing friendship.

 Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things @MONTH1 not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You @MONTH1 think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people @MONTH1 find very simple things considerably amusing, but others @MONTH1 be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us. And regardless of the way you @MONTH1 interpret laughter's abstract form, you've got to admit: it's kind of funny.

Someone once told me that laughter is the key element of comfort. I believe that @CAPS7 is one of the most important part of any relationship. @CAPS7's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob @CAPS1, when @ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help @CAPS7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh @CAPS7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-@CAPS2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, "@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur," then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend @PERSON1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, @CAPS4 was waiting on the steps for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 stood back a second then said, "aw were you waiting for me little one." @CAPS4 replied with, "@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur." I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. @CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe @CAPS7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions.

                            On @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is a true story about a time that i had with two of my friends/squad member named @PERSON3 and @PERSON1. When we were walking @CAPS3 cheer-leading practice on a @DATE1 @TIME1. We had a good laugh going @CAPS3 @NUM1 and I were getting cold, because we were in shorts and sweatshirts, @CAPS8 we put on @CAPS1 hoods. @CAPS6 @PERSON3 wanted @CAPS3 put her hood up also @CAPS8 she didn't feel lonely, but her hood was @CAPS3 small and with thick hair it just made it worse for her. @CAPS8 she tired @CAPS3 put her hood on anyways and her hair went on the top of her head and her curls are at the bottom of her hair. @CAPS8 when when she put her hood on it made her look like a poodle.When we got @CAPS3 the end of the block that I live on @PERSON1 said her foot was hurting, @CAPS8 i told her i would give her a piggy back ride. @CAPS8 she got onto my back, and i told her @CAPS13 we get @CAPS3 the end of this block set me down and we can cross the street @CAPS6 give me a piggy back ride, @CAPS8 @PERSON1 gave me a piggy back ride. @CAPS8 when we crossed and @CAPS6 we told @PERSON3 that it was her turn @CAPS3 give one of us a piggy back ride, i was about @CAPS3 get on @PERSON3's back the @PERSON1 said "@CAPS5 just got a turn! Now it's my turn!"@CAPS6 i was like "@CAPS7 @PERSON1. Okay @PERSON3 give me your backpack and water bottle." @CAPS8 @PERSON3 gave her stuff @CAPS3 me and gave @PERSON1 a piggy back ride. @CAPS6 @CAPS13 that we got @CAPS3 the end of the block, I told @PERSON3 that she now had @CAPS3 give me a piggy back ride. @CAPS6 @PERSON3 was like "@CAPS9! I'm @CAPS3 tired" In the end of that conversation she gave me what i wanted.At the end of that last block @PERSON3 set me down and @CAPS6 we crossed the street. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 drove by us yelling "@CAPS10!" @CAPS6 we turned around @CAPS3 see who yelled that at us, and we found out it was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 I said "@CAPS12 look it's @PERSON2! She is actually here on time!" @CAPS13 @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON2 us, we three girls started @CAPS3 just bust out laughing. We started @CAPS3 laugh because of what @PERSON2 yelled out at us.When @PERSON2 went @CAPS3 go park her car, we just started walking up @CAPS3 her @CAPS3 talk @CAPS3 her, as she was getting out of her car.@CAPS8 when @PERSON2 got out of her car we were just getting @CAPS3 her car. She walked up @CAPS3 us and we started @CAPS3 talk and walk into the school where we practice. As we were walking i said @CAPS3 @PERSON2 "@CAPS5 are actually here on time!" @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 responded by saying "I know right?!" We finally got @CAPS3 the doors @PERSON2 said "@CAPS12 everyone is here today!"  @CAPS8 that is a time that i had a good laugh with more @CAPS6 just one person. Going @CAPS3 that practice was a blast that night. That night was fantastic going @CAPS3 cheer leading practice. Hope @CAPS3 have that much fun going @CAPS3 practice again.

                               Freshmen @CAPS1 All freshmen @CAPS1 was a @CAPS1 of fun. There was this boy who made me smile and laugh. I swore I was falling in love. We had one class together. Which was called @CAPS2. Passing each other in the hallway just would make my @DATE1. We met in a class that we both didn't care for. I would ask him for help even though I didn't need it just so I could talk to him. We also would see each other at the swimming pool because his brother swam and I did also. I would see him during the @DATE1 but not very often. Instead of him "helping" me we would sit and talk about our lives how they were at school and at home.  First semester is over and he got moved out of the class to another class period. We would still talk at the pool and see each during the school @DATE1. He would now give me hugs in the hallway. We started to become really close friends. Talking drew us even closer. Laughing was big part in our conversations. We found out that we have a lot in common. Like hunting, wheeling, foods, favorite dog and our personalities are so much alike, that it seems as if we grew up around each other. @MONTH1 came around one more month of school. I started to go to his house every once in awhile. He came to mine more often. In the beginning of @DATE4 strawberry festival came around and I asked him to go with me. He said okay and his parents also went but with my parents. That @DATE3 was fun and enjoyable. The end of @DATE4 was finally here, school was out in a @DATE1. Summer break was here. The @DATE1 @DATE1 of school was fun. It was going to be so nice not to have homework over the @DATE3 or during the week. All we did the @DATE1 of school was sign @CAPS1 books and tell funny stories about the school @CAPS1. After school I went to swim practice and after practice he was still at the pool waiting for his brother. We were outside talking and all the sudden out of know where he asked me "will you go out with me"? I said... yes! He made me one of the happiest girls in the world that @DATE1. Today, in @DATE2 we are still dating. One and only relationship I have ever had. I hope we @DATE1. He tells me almost every @DATE1 that he is going to marry me. He tells me he doesn't know what he would do with out me. I told everyone I swore I was falling in love. Now everyone knows I fell in love. I fell in love at first sight. We talk and laugh all the time we hardly ever argue.

When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1.We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so I jumped off the four-wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS1. It was by far the biggest @CAPS2 head that we have ever seen.  While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON1 told me to get the net he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole.At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON1 was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole.   Once @PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole.  The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @PERSON1 and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON2 was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON2 jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally i don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had.

 One time when i was spending the night at @ORGANIZATION1's she wanted to sleep oustide in a tent. @CAPS2 was @DATE1 and we always tryed seeing eachother anytime possible because she had to go back to boarding school alot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went ouside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and i was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. @CAPS2 was like two best friends dating two bestfriends, and we were closer then ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the @TIME1 so @CAPS2 was just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point i was just cracking up with laughfter, @ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd her self while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happend, so all of this was going on at around one in the @TIME1 and i was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When i looked over and saw that she had pee'd her self i yelled out "@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION1!" @CAPS2 was the most funniest thing, i dont think i have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said "@CAPS3 should probably go take care of that," and then they got off the phone. She was really embarassed after that, i mean i would be too if that happend to me.

@ORGANIZATION1 is one of the many joys I love to share with people. I absolutely love to laugh, I don't know where i would be if I didn't laugh. My cousin; @CAPS1 and I, are usually together for most of the @DATE1 and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks. @CAPS1's dad; @PERSON1, gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1. After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster, me being the one who drank most of it, was the one who was staying calm. @CAPS1 on the other hand, who drank a couple of sips, was going crazy. She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet. She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it. @ORGANIZATION1 hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy; @PERSON1's wife and my second cousin started to get hungry, so we went to go eat pizza at the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe that is there. My mom had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza. I handed my plate to @CAPS1 because my plate was slipping from my grip. She was holding her food in her other hand, she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to @PERSON1 who wasn't paying attention and he didn't have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us. After that embarrassing moment, @PERSON1 realized that he forgot the churos, so he told @CAPS1 to go get them. All three of us realized his mistake as soon as @CAPS1 left, cause @CAPS1 is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying @CAPS1 is probably going to drop them". We were a little surprised that she hadn't dropped them yet, as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table, one of the churos fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We were @ORGANIZATION1 so hard that we couldn't breathe. @CAPS1 was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @CAPS1, but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things i usually say is if you can't and aren't willing to laugh at yourself then you aren't having fun. That's why i believe it is so important to laugh cause you gotta learn how to have fun when it is in a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but yet aren't wanting to. That's one of the biggest ways to have fun is by @ORGANIZATION1, because you know you made a small silly mistake that you think everyone in the world saw, all you need is to laugh it off. But you wont cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake. Sometimes it's your job to go over to them, pat them on the back and tell them that everybody makes mistakes, you gotta learn how to be silly in a tough situation, and that nobody is perfect. Tell them to laugh it off, it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down just get back up cause that's what life is all about. That's the only way you can learn from your mistakes and from life as well. Laughter is really important the more you laugh the better you feel and the better you feel the more fun you will have. Laughter fixes everything, it is a bandage for the little things that happen in life."

                 A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  I once heard "laughter is the best medicine." I believe that is true. I could laugh all day long, finding anything @CAPS9 everything funny in @CAPS3 world. Laughter is important to me, without it, life would be boring. Sometimes Laughter is good @CAPS9 comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS9 mean. I like to avoid the cruel @CAPS9 mean laughter, @CAPS9 just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing @CAPS9 smiling, it makes me want to know @CAPS10 they're laughing about, so I can laugh too.  Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends, @CAPS9 my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS9 I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy @CAPS9 always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @CAPS9 soon the party was over, but, my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in @CAPS9 wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. "@CAPS3 is so good!" my cousin @PERSON1 said. "I know that's why I had my mom make it" " @CAPS4 you wanna hear a joke?" "@CAPS5." @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS6, @CAPS7 once was a kid named butt itches, he was really sick @CAPS9 one day died, his mom cried to the doctor,"@CAPS8 my poor butt itches!" "@CAPS9 @CAPS12, @CAPS4 you wanna know @CAPS10 the doctor said?" "@CAPS10?" @CAPS11 @PERSON1. "@CAPS12 itch it!" @PERSON1 had just took a drink of punch when I said @CAPS3. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, it got all over me. Usually when someone spits, or spills something on you, you get mad. I started cracking up laughing, @CAPS9 so did she. "@CAPS8 my gosh! That's so gross." "@NUM1 @CAPS9 I could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny, it was the punch all over me @CAPS9 the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us wondering @CAPS10 in the world had happened.  You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your @CAPS2, would make you mad. @CAPS3 is why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case laughter was the shortest distance between @PERSON1 @CAPS9 I. It would have to be short for her to get that much punch on me. Laughter made @CAPS3 @CAPS2 extra special, because I will never forget my twelfth @CAPS2.

 @CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10 , @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and now even @CAPS2 ( @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5). Laughter! some say it is the best median. It can brighten a cloudy day, cure a case of the blues, and even sooth a breaking heart.  On the other hand a simple sinker or soft giggle can break a heart to! I have had first hand experience listening to goofy squeals being thrown my way and not because I told a witty joke simply just for siting, siting in my @NUM1 grade class room and becoming the but of my pears jokes. Before I go on with this story there are a few things @CAPS6 must know. Let alone that all @NUM1 graders have a common undeniable erg to bring people down so they can build them self's up. I was a @NUM1 grader who's weight had reached the point at witch my doctors were telling me "@CAPS6 should look in to a weight loss program." this news alone was crushing my self a steam and my class mates laughter soon brought me to tears. I can recall a particular @CAPS7, perhaps one of the worst. I was on the buss and almost home when @NUM4 girls who i thought were my friends started laughing. Little did I know it was me they were laughing at so I joined in what i thought, and what seamed to be some @CAPS8 giggling. Suddenly they stopped, looked at me started whispering to each other then one of the girls blurted @CAPS4 between chuckles "@CAPS6 look like a beached wail!". She said this so @CAPS5 the whole buss herd and immediately burst in to side spiting laughter. I walked down the same street i walked down every day were the buss dropped me off. That day it seamed more gloomy then ever before. This is the day I decided I was never going to set foot on the buss again! It is encounters with laughter like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation towards loosing weight and regaining confidence. Days, weeks, months, even years have passed scene that day in the @NUM1 grade. I'm @NUM6 pounds lighter, a varsity cheerleader and proved of who I am. The tables have turned for me in many ways. I am no longer the person who gets laughed at because of my weight, but some times i catch my self sometimes mindlessly cracking a joke or two at some one else expense. I can recall just the other day, I was with my best friend at the mall. She spotted this girl who was over weight and immediately started giggling and elbowing me in the side trying to draw my attention to her like she was some freak show. When I saw the girl my first reaction was a hideous @CAPS3 but just as soon as I did so i felt the same pain I felt when that buss full of my pears laughed at me. I immediately stopped, realizing the pain my laughter could have brought her. My self, I am a very funny person and will do just about any thing for a @CAPS3. But when it comes to laughing at people and hurting there feelings this is were i draw the line because i know how it feels to be in there position and i hope that my story helps open the eyes of u and others to the harmful effects some laughter can have. So go ahead and @CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and even @CAPS2 just not at the expense of another persons feelings.

 Laughter is a big part of my life and I believe @CAPS1 have to have laughter in a good and healthy relationship. This is a true story about laughter and it's affects on my life.Laughter is a good thing for your body, mind and soul, it lightens my mood when I'm feeling down. I'm glad to say I have lots of relationships, many of which are blessed with laughter. My mother and I have a good relationship together, and almost any time we're together in the same room there is bound to be laughter. My mother and I laugh all the time, over silly things. We laugh just to laugh and most of the time, we don't even know what we're laughing at. She can make me laugh at the most ridiculous things. I'm also pretty sure she's the only person who can get me to spit my drink all over the dash board just because of a silly face she made.  My mother isn't the only one I can have a good time with. I remember a conversation I had with a good friend of mine, it was about the way people laughed. I told her about how I had noticed that people usually laughed in different vowel sounds, like a, e and o. It seemed odd to me that I had only ever heard people laughing in those vowels and not I and u. She thought the same thing I did, so we came up with this idea to laugh in the vowels I and u. Of course people were too busy with their own lives to notice us laughing oddly, but it was fun all the same. @CAPS1 never really realize how hard it is to not laugh until the occasion is upon @CAPS1. My mom and I were at my aunts house trying desperately not too laugh. We had all decided to do a facial cleansing mask we had seen on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The mask itself was made out of whisked egg whites and toilet paper. @CAPS1 dip the toilet paper in the egg whites and plaster it all over your face. @CAPS1 have to wait at least fifteen minutes or until it's completely dry before @CAPS1 can take it off, other wise it doesn't work.   The three of us did as the instructions told us, but were dismayed when we saw the final results of our efforts. We weren't upset because we looked repulsive we were upset because we all looked like a bunch of crazy ladies, and we found it exceedingly difficult not to burst into laughter. The site of my mother and aunt was so ridiculously funny I had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry. After about fifteen minutes I came back to find my mother and aunt in the bathroom drying each others face with a hair dryer. After seeing this I just couldn't stand it any longer, I started crying with laughter, my mask cracked and all my hard work went down the drain. that day was one of the funniest days of my life, we laughed together so hard our abdomens hurt. I love to laugh as I've said before and I personally have many different forms of laughter. when I laugh really hard I laugh all the air out of my lungs and forget to breathe. What it looks like to others I have no clue but I must be a red faced girl rocking back and forth. Other times I kind of have a manly ha ha but if your lucky @CAPS1'll get to hear me snort. The thing I'm trying to say is that laughter is a good thing and it has made a big difference in my life, I don't know what I would do without it. I love to laugh, I think I would die if I couldn't laugh.
<START>

 The laughter in me.  To me all you need to do to get through a tough and horrible day is a good @CAPS5. It gives you hope throughout the day, and no matter what kind of mood your in, when leaving to work, going to school, or really any activity that involves a "sigh" moment. For me I get that feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @PERSON1. Everyday she manages to say something totally off topic and we'd end up dying of laughter at the top of the stairs near the science labs were we eat lunch. As people walk by they give us weird looks, we don't care because we understand each other. To me @CAPS9 is my way of reliving stress.My @CAPS1 agrees with me her name is @CAPS2 I call her @ORGANIZATION1. We've been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working at some fast food restaurant. I hang out a lot at her at her house and we share so many great and fun memories. Its really bad when we are around each other, its like one look at each other and boom!, I'm on the floor not breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is but, its like when we see each other its a rush off all the good times we've spent coming together all at once. Sometimes we @CAPS5 hysterically over nothing. I doesn't make sense but I guess that doesn't matter when your hanging with your best bud.  Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. Its shows me how fun a person can be and if the have a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and not some stuck up want to be perfect robot. All @PERSON1 and I talk about is boys and boy problems and it makes me @CAPS5 and giggle, but when we are in our fifth period class forestry and fire we are like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we are magically "high," all of a sudden have this out burst of energy. We sit next to sit side by side to one another and we tickle each other and @CAPS5 really loud. By the end of class I make a paper ball and we play paper soccer ball its fun especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop and you don't do it. Lets just say that her face turns a very bright red color.Nothing compares to how much I @CAPS5 when I'm with @ORGANIZATION1. When I used to go to @CAPS3 I had three classes with her @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4. We also had lunch together, but anyway as I was saying, I swear we had a not stop @CAPS9 war everyday. My @CAPS5 is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like, some thinks its cute, others think I @CAPS5 funny( The weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2 she'd stand next to me and she'd look at me weird, or said something that didn't come out right, or sang obnoxiously, anything she did cracked me up it was so distracted when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from @CAPS9 with her. At home when my family is all together, are way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It's different than laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS6 was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mothers stomach. We made fun of my brother for being the only boy out of five kids. We make fun of my sister @PERSON2 for being the shortest one in our family. I can feel the difference between laughter. It's mostly criticism really.I @CAPS5 mostly because I feel more alive it gives me something to live for everyday in stead of "@CAPS7 great, another day to try to get through, @CAPS8...no." @CAPS9 for me gets me motivated for the day it's like my drug to get through life. It gives me an easy way in to communicate with others. I thank @CAPS10 for giving us the ability to @CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. "That's how I make friends I @CAPS5."

                               The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3  The beautiful flames danced so peacefully in the @CAPS1 air. The faint shimmer of the blaze was the only light we had. As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by @PERSON4, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race @PERSON2 to the @ORGANIZATION1. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about @CAPS2 for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were @CAPS4 and the @LOCATION1. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. @PERSON3 was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged @PERSON3 and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, @CAPS2. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the @CAPS1 shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if @CAPS2 were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation.

 What makes you laugh? Laughter is a really good stress reliever. There are many different types of laughs around the world, some people's laughs are really high pitched and others @MONTH1 be very deep and low. Some other people snort and make other animal noises. I know that for me I have many different types of laughs for all the different emotions I feel. When I am upset I have a very distinctive laugh. Although when I am upset I laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day.   One time during a basketball game, I was having a really off night. Fouls were being called on me left and right. Normally when this happens to me, I get really mad and I lose my head and end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench. I absolutely hate sitting on the bench. This time when I got a foul called on me after already being threatened to be ejected from the previous game for the same reason. I decided to just smile and laugh about the foul and told myself to shake it off. My coach was very pleased with my change in attitude and just told me to play defense with my feet and to shake the bad call off and keep my head. When you are mad a person can take a lot away from the demonstrative looks you can make, although if you just smile and laugh about it, their reactions will be a lot different. I am not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way. A lot of us just laugh about calls that are made and just shake them off.  I am also a cheerleader. When you are a cheerleader you should always try to have a smile on your face at all times, and make it seem like you are in a happy mood. I play in a basketball game every night before I go out and cheer. I have to do my best to keep my cool while playing so that I'm in a good mood for after my game when I do cheer. Laughing helps me a lot with keeping my cool and relaxing while I am playing, so I'm in a good mood for cheer.  My coach is also very huge on people having positive attitudes. She tells us at practice that if we just smile and laugh about things that go wrong the outcome will be a lot better then if we have bad attitudes about it. I took this in very strongly and it stayed with me. My coach inflenced me to have a better attitude and since that day I have tried to have a positive attitude. I keep my positive attitude by just smiling and laughing when things in my life go wrong.  A laugh can go a really long way. I personally think laughing helps express the mood you are in. Laughing is also good for the body. Laughing can make you feel one hundred times better when you are feeling down in the dumps. I try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times. I really don't like being in a bad mood, it's really not fun. Laughing makes me feel a lot better.  I think that laughing is a very good function for the body. I feel that when I laugh it makes my mood better and the moods of the people around me a lot better. Laughing is a magical feeling that goes through out your body and makes you feel warm inside. I think everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will make your day that much better.

 Laughter is the so called "best medicine". I do not believe that to be true, however my nephew @MONTH1 have other thoughts. My nephew was "sick" for every school day for two weeks. "@CAPS1 just doesn't like school", I would tell his grandma. The thought of school being no fun and not liking it changed drastically for my nephew.  We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they get a party, lucky for @CAPS2 they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing it's ugly face that morning as @CAPS1 fought every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door @PERSON1 did something uncharacteristic, to him and five year old's all over the @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags, they went all out for the first one of the year. The aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire. Above all they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all of this cooked thirty feet from you. so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva. These children played with a ninja like ability, one moment in front of you, you blink, and just as fast as you blinked they disappeared. It took me an hour at least to find @PERSON1 in that small room. As I realized though it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and nearly unbearable surface @PERSON1 was in front of me. @CAPS1 had this ear to ear grin on his face that scared me, @CAPS1 never had that big of a grin on his face unless @CAPS1 had a plan. @CAPS1 definitely had a plan, in seconds my face was soaked.  @CAPS1 had been concealing a squirt gun behind his back, and had the escape route planned out. With the chairs and the short tables how they sat long legs and weaving through them did not go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we hit the hallway and I could extend my legs it was an easy run. His ear to ear grin disappeared once I caught him, but the laughter on both sides did not. @CAPS1 @MONTH1 have got my face but I got his head! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still party hard, but thanks to us no more squirt guns. I think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school. @PERSON1 is a very smart, athletic and good child. @CAPS1 will be just fine in school, plus @CAPS1 is strong so I pity the child who fights him.

 I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that alot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in it's own way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.                         So @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3.

 Laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you've just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion @CAPS2 brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role. @CAPS2 was the @DATE1 I was fifteen and a sophomore at @ORGANIZATION1 school. @CAPS2 was my first year there. I have been to many schools, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wood, etc. and like any new school I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday I woke up, got ready, went to school, got home did homework (maybe), and went to bed . @CAPS2 was a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much. Because one thing I realized was that trying to be cool and something you're not only gets you so far. The one thing that kids, people in general, like is when you're real and being yourself . I found that out later on, but I actually didn't realize that's what people liked the most. I said to myself one time that I didn't like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was I actually thought that I was a cool person deep down. So I changed my ways I stopped trying to act cool, and acted like myself. And @CAPS2 turned out that I actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive, and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable. My main attribute, well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @CAPS2 gained me many friends that I didn't have in the beginning. @CAPS2 even gained me one of the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her name was @LOCATION2, in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, caramel skin, and the face of a goddess ( and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me. So what chance did I have? What did I, @PERSON1 have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times. Even though @CAPS2 didn't last as long as I would have liked @CAPS2( forever) @CAPS2 was great being with her for as long as I did, the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together, are priceless. And @CAPS2 was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that @CAPS2 is today. Sure, there is still crime and many horrors and atrocity's committed today, but imagine how horrid @CAPS2 would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. @CAPS2 allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future

 Laughter @MONTH1 be the best part of life. It usually expresses the feeling of happiness and joy. The expression almost seems contagious in a way, one laugh that goes hand in hand with a smile could improve someones day drastically. Possibly the best part about laughter is that it is not hard to come by, there are many things in our world that are worthy of laughter. I have personally find myself laughing most when I am around people that I enjoy being with. Some people think the key to happiness @MONTH1 be love or joy, or possibly being happy with yourself. I think the key is surrounding yourself with the ones you love and care for because everything seems better when they are around. They are comparable to sunshine, everything is better in its presence.  My favorite memory that involved excessive laughter took place on a warm @DATE1 day at my friend's house just outside of city limits. It must have been around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. The @DATE1 air was warm, but not overwhelmingly hot. It seemed like the perfect afternoon. My friends and I were hanging out, playing catch with a football, building a fire, and being happy. We had all the components needed to have the best night of our lives. The most vivid memory I have is when we were playing catch, I threw a deep pass to my friend and as he he was running under the ball, he ran straight into a fence. He got up laughing, and the laughter spread. That, you could say, set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of the @TIME1 seemed like it could have been straight out of a movie. Everything was going right and we were all feeling good. It was the quintessence of happiness. Laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us. It had to me my best memory of laughter.

  Laughter is the esscense of life. Without laughter my life would be meaningless, and without that sense of happiness or compassion, life wouldnt be worth living. My sister is the only person i trust with my secrets. She is the only one who makes me happy when i feel down. My sister and I, laugh with eachother at our own jokes. My sister is my other half and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when i need her. I'll always be there for her also. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2, my sister and I laugh and play. One day I came off the bus from school, all i could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a river flowing. The bus appeared and a sense of joy appeared with it. @CAPS1, it wasnt the bus that brought my joy. It was my sister, right away she could feel my pain and noticed my tears. I could see in her face, the love and care. She asked me whats wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. @CAPS1 need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said,"@CAPS1 matter whatever happens, I'll always love you." @CAPS2 we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh. A chorus of laughter filled the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it.

 The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure. Shadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I said things that were unnecessary and horrible. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. I turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS1 pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat and immediately @CAPS1 knew something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer, "@PERSON1."  @CAPS1 knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS1 did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession. Bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again and then @CAPS1 asked me, "@CAPS2 you feel better now that you got it all out?" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, payed, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke @CAPS1 told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And there have always been there proving I can count on them.  That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if your counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS2 it ten make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear. I hope that one day when I am old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magical. It can make a sad man glad, make sunshine on a cloudy day, and make light of the darkest situations.

  Being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend. Everyone has their flaws; a friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust. A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. Making someone laugh can always help when they think that it's not possible for their life to get any worse. Laughter is the most valued gift that can be given. You know inside that it's making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face. There have been many times in my life where I have laughed so hard that I cried. There is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter. I laugh a lot throughout the day. When I don't, people get suspicious and they feel like there's something wrong with me. That's literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life. Laughing is my second language in life. There has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that I cried tremendously hard. My friends were staying the @TIME1 at my house and we were just being boys. We did so many things that mad us question our sanity: we at hot sauce by the spoon full, we watched comedy shows, and we also ate ourselves sick. It was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. While watching the comedy shows, we couldn't breath. We were laughing so hard! Nothing could make me stop laughing; I would just keep replaying every joke in my head and I'd start laughing even more. I already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier. The comedian was a magician with words; the way he put them all together to just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did that for ten minutes straight! It was unbelievable. Making these life-long memories with my friends is something that I will never forget. I truly know how great I have it in my life; people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support I get from my friends and family. All my experiences are the things I learn from, whether they're good or bad, I know that its all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me. All the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. They made a point in my day great as well. Being myself around them is great as well because I know that they're already accepted me into their lives and I don't have to try to be anyone else.  Everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it. I really don't even know why they would because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while? I really don't think that there is any. I feel really honored that I have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life. It shouldn't be any other way in my personal opinion. Live life to the fullest; why would you want to live it any other way?

 Its always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. @PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worry. Couple minutes later, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happen. @PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time. Even thought that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to @PERSON1 but I was confuse. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confuse, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON1 was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relief that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst. As I was laughing I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to be call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON1 laughed with me and thank me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and cant really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh I found out laughter was a key element of life.   
<START>

 Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without @CAPS3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @CAPS1 are a great source for laughter, @CAPS1 are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS10 dad gets hurt he starts laughing. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but @CAPS3 did hurt him. so @CAPS10 @CAPS2 sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, @CAPS3 wasn't too long ago. @CAPS3 was last @DATE3, @CAPS3 was early @DATE5 and @CAPS5 of @DATE5 was coming close. Traditionally me and @CAPS10 parents would drive to @ORGANIZATION1. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks.  Once @CAPS5 of @DATE5 came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to @CAPS10 mom and ask "@CAPS3's @CAPS5 of @DATE5 can I take the fireworks out to the package now?" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. @CAPS7 shook her head "@CAPS6 yet @PERSON1, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight" @CAPS7 smiled at me. "@CAPS8 girl." @CAPS7 whispered as @CAPS7 left the room.  Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew @CAPS3 was time. "@CAPS9 you like to do the honors?" @CAPS10 dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto @CAPS10 face without @CAPS10 control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling @CAPS3 with a sea of colorful sparks. After @CAPS5 of @DATE5 had ended @CAPS10 cousin @CAPS12 came over. @CAPS10 mom had was little sick but @CAPS3 wasn't something that was contagious. @CAPS10 @CAPS25 figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for @CAPS10 mom. And @DATE3 was ending and I wanted to see the movie @CAPS13 with @CAPS10 mom and @CAPS12 so badly.  @CAPS10 mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but @CAPS3 seemed like @CAPS7 got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems.  Its mid @DATE5, @DATE4, and still no sign of @CAPS10 mom getting any better. @CAPS12 and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched @CAPS15, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really.  @DATE1 came, and @CAPS10 mom was showing signs of improvement @CAPS7 was walking more naturally . I called @CAPS10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because @CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS10 moms voice. "@LOCATION1, @PERSON1 honey wake up" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder. I opened @CAPS10 eyes slowly, opening them wider as @CAPS10 eyes focused of what was around me. "@CAPS18 go to the movies?" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder once again. "@CAPS19, but your sick." I exhaled a heavy sigh. "I am feeling a lot better today." @CAPS7 smiled. "@CAPS21 because the next showing is in twenty minutes." The sudden rush to @CAPS21, woke me up. I then woke @CAPS12 up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, @CAPS12 went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still.  @DATE2. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on @CAPS10 computer most of the day, @CAPS10 dad was playing his video game. and @CAPS10 mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. @CAPS10 dad went in to help her with dinner. until @CAPS7 almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. @CAPS10 dad suggested that @CAPS7 go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @CAPS10 dad had found @CAPS10 mother. laying stiff, cold...@CAPS10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if @CAPS10 heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting @CAPS12. Told her what the doctors told us. @CAPS12 mentioned how torn @CAPS10 @CAPS25 was about @CAPS10 mom. And even though @CAPS12 was hurting inside, her and her @CAPS2 @PERSON2 tried to get @CAPS10 @CAPS25 and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives. 
<START>

 Someone once said,"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS1, to me that means, that since everyone laughs, laughter is the quickest or easiest way to connect with another person. I believe this because at one point in time my older brother and I did not get along very well. We were almost never around each other, and when we were,we would either be fighting or ignoring one another. It wasn't much of a problem since he is five years older; but once I became older my brother and I began to see one another more often. So we then decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't exactly sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes we just sat there in silence. Just two guys on the back porch in the middle of the @TIME1. Then out of no were he fell over backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we have ever laughed in our lives. So @CAPS1, when my family get together, there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit and tell stories and laugh.For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important components of a relationship because, with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life. So I say, "Laughter is the shortest distance between all people."

 This true story might sound some what cheesy, but its true and in my opinion its a love story. I will be substituting the real names with others names though. On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log on @CAPS1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to @PERSON2. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 had accepted @PERSON1's request that's when @PERSON1 remembered about the request. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, @CAPS9 before the had no clue who the other one was. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after along chat, @CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of @CAPS1-book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knew that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @NUM1 and also have friends in common. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked talking to @PERSON2 a lot. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean "a lot", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked that because it always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, @PERSON2 didn't mind, he @CAPS4 liked @PERSON1. He had a @CAPS4 big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12... he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said... "@CAPS3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend".  "@CAPS4 you would?" @CAPS5 @PERSON2.  "@CAPS3 why wouldn't I? replied @PERSON1. "@CAPS6 I thought that you wouldn't @CAPS9 you recently got out of a relationship" @PERSON2 answered. Days had past they were doing perfectly until... @PERSON1 starting to receive texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect @PERSON1's relationship with @PERSON2.But the bad thing was that @PERSON1 was still in love with @PERSON3. @PERSON2 knew that for one. But that didn't stop @PERSON2 from fighting to get @LOCATION1's @CAPS7. @PERSON1 is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS12 one night while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 were talking on the phone, @PERSON2 decided to ask @PERSON1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... "@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything."@CAPS9 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 have a @CAPS4 good communication when laughing is involved, @PERSON1 changed the subject and @CAPS5 @PERSON2 if he was willing on doing her a favor. Of course @PERSON2 said "@CAPS3". The favor that @PERSON1 had @CAPS5 @PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. "@CAPS11!" @PERSON2 laughed. "@CAPS12 can you do me that favor? @PERSON1 @CAPS5. "@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it @CAPS12 much better. @CAPS3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting @NUM2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. @CAPS6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships.

My relationship with laughter.  Well the first time I came face to face with laughter was when I met my boyfriend for the first time. Before I met him I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't stand it anymore. But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time. When that happened for the first time in almost a year I smiled I didn't smile until the day I met him. That's when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who I am.  Later in the relationship is where laughter came into play I was laughing all the time when I was around him and not upset all the time. That's when we started hanging out but, it took all of our friends to us to hang out. After we stated to hang out we got to know each other better then we did for the beginning when we first met. It took until freshmen year for us to start dating. That is when I found out I suppose ably dating someone else and not him I didn't believe it at first until that guy came up to me and started yelling.   He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said "@CAPS1 are @CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over?" with a guy @CAPS3 just met. Then he tried telling me it was over and I told him "We were never dating in the first place!". My friends walked up to me and saw me in tears and asked me whats wrong and tried to find me someone new. By the time @CAPS4 did I was with another guy and I'm happy with him and nothing can change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when I'm upset or mad he says "don't worry everything will be okay I promise so just believe in me."  Laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now so we don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again we have messed up so many time that we don't know what to do anymore. If it leaves now I don't know what I'm going to do it's apart of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together with out messing up this time around. This part of my relationship is the best and it wont change at least I hope that it wont because it would make me go back to living in fear of my step dad I'm glade that I found someone. I hope that it doesn't change because laughter is what comes with him and when I'm around him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when I was crying not even my friends and family. Now that laughter is here almost all the time I can't wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window. So now that me and him are together and happy and hopefully nothing goes bad between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not my bubbly self when he's not around. Six to @CAPS2 of my friends say " @CAPS3 are losing your bubbly self don't let her disappear on @CAPS3 she is there to guide @CAPS3 down the road." @CAPS4 also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason @CAPS1 I don't is because @CAPS4 can be bossy and @CAPS4 tell me what I can and can't do. @CAPS1 can't people just understand that this relationship isn't going to work if @CAPS4 keep getting in the middle of it @CAPS4 all think that my life revolves around them and it doesn't. My relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family it has to do with my boyfriend and me and that's @CAPS1 I told @CAPS3 about my relationship with laughter. Lets just say my relationship with laughter will always be here and nothing will change it not even my parents or his parents we can promise @CAPS3 that much. @CAPS1 can't this relationship just have a happy ending to it with out anyone or anything trying to get in the middle of it? I just wish that there was a world @CAPS3 could just run away to with out anyone knowing where it's at in the world. Well just to say nothing can make this relationship ever go bad unless we start to fight again with each other I hope that nothing will tear us apart and if it does who knows what will happen.

                             "Laughter" I once heard a man say " laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life.

Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!

 Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and couldn't remember. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends. Admittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time, instead we started off as a crier and a helper.  @PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my math teacher @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from @LOCATION1 and wasn't exactly happy about it. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4, I agreed and walked into the room @PERSON3 was in. When I saw her the first thing I noticed was her eyes, as the tears went down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, like @PERSON1 said wasn't happy. I will admit i was a little scared to try and show her around seeing as she wasn't happy at all to be here. But once we got started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble tempts to make jokes. I still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns. So I walked differently and talked in a funny voice, I even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Eventually she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end I got her and @PERSON4 to laugh so hard we all almost wet ourselves. But as funny as it was for us, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see that person it happened with, right? Well to say the least @PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class we, @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, and @CAPS1 and I, were all in @PERSON2's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and so had @CAPS3 else. I randomly look around the room and see a really cute looking poster I hadn't noticed ever before and without realizing it I had said aloud, "@CAPS2, that's really cute." @CAPS3 started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I'd just said and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends.  But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we didn't do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things, or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with that other person, I feel like I become a better person and I believe I help her become one too. Besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do.  So as I've stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship. @PERSON3 and my friendship hadn't started in of laughter, it started in tears and grew to be laughter. Laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank we don't really even have that much in common, it is because of the big hilarious moments we've shared not only together, but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny. I do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy.

 There are a couple things that can lead strangers to being comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriends parents was very nerve wrecking and uncomfortable. I am a people person and I can get along with anybody. Starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge.  My boyfriend @PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families. So because of this it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we attended the last years of elementary and some of middle school and all but one year of high school together, I left for a couple years and came back really different. So after @NUM1 months of dating I met the folks.  One day in @DATE1 @PERSON3 had a football game that i attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss @PERSON3 came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I wanted his parents to love me put a lot of weight on me.  I slowly walked over after him, and said "@CAPS3" in my most friendly voice possible. His mother reached out and said " @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I'm @CAPS2" I took her hand and shook it and replied "@CAPS3, so nice to meet you". I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. " @CAPS4 there, I'm @PERSON2", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a bit comfortable. " @CAPS1 , great to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football.  After talking about football for about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes @PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke, @PERSON3 thought it was lame, yet i loved it. I took the chance anyways. I said " @CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke", @PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that said oh god, don't. I looked away and started "so there were two muffins in the oven one said, wow its hot in here, there the other screamed, holy crap! A talking muffin. I started laughing and my laugh is very odd. Anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique. His mother was like "that is adorable i will have to tell it to @CAPS6", I smiled gratefully. His father @PERSON2 said so sweetly " I like your laugh, i ain't heard anything like it". @PERSON3 came in and said "yes her laugh is really something". We all kinda smiled and at each other and went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing then laughing at my laugh. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcomed. Until this day we laugh at me telling that joke. I still until this day am happy i told the joke.

   On @DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I had @CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION2. When we got to the church I went to @CAPS11 meeting till @NUM2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then.    Come to realize @CAPS11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON1 craft store. When we got there me and @PERSON2 went over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought me and @CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into @PERSON1 to brag about the slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma.   That was a bad idea, @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @CAPS6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS6 @PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home.   We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out "were going to @LOCATION5's, I want a bowl of chili". Our reaction was "@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says "I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1", @CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 forever in a day.   After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was "@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by @PERSON2 and @CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all @CAPS11 breath, and @CAPS11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road. When I eventually fell asleep.

 Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughing is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my realationship with my sister @LOCATION1, we laugh all day, everyday. And I think thats why we have most fun together. I laugh most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with @PERSON2 and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. I'm just a laughing person. Everybody knows that. I think when I laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. I have this one friend namd @PERSON3, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time me and @PERSON2 were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. Then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. See, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. Who cares. Be you. I love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. In movies and tv shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  One time me and my sister @PERSON2 stole a truck, well.. We asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. It was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. So, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. It's funny to just sit there and reminise. I could tell you a thousand stories. Heres one. One time, me and @PERSON2 were living with our good friend @PERSON1, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! I'll never forget that time. And even when I'm writing this I still laugh about these stories. One time me and my sister @PERSON2 were skating downtown, and I was trying to do this one trick, I think it was a tre' flip? Anyways, I tryed to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory that I have, I laugh when remebered. One time me and @PERSON2 were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. That was really funny. In the video I'm mostly just laughing.

@CAPS1.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS6 my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS6 I was @CAPS5 I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS6 people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better. @CAPS2!", it hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just gotten out from a four month sentence, three months ago. One of the hardest things is thinking of what to say @CAPS6 his three year old son, @PERSON1, asks "@CAPS3's @CAPS4?". The main reason I'm not as scared for my brother as I was is because of my nephew @PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So whenever my brother gets thrown back into jail, I know everything will be okay @CAPS6 I see a big smile on @PERSON1's little chubby face. He is my inspiration to smile @CAPS6 I feel like there is absolutely nothing in this word to smile or laugh about. Even @CAPS6 we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing.  Being @CAPS5 is the absolute worst thing in the world to me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go places. All I usually do is go stuff outside with my friends, but @CAPS6 I'm @CAPS5 I cant do anything. The only things I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains. Then not even two weeks later I was back in the emergency room with strep. I was in a lot of pain for about four weeks all together. one thing I hate more then being @CAPS5, is people feeling bad for me being @CAPS5. So whenever I'm @CAPS5 I always crack jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts me to laugh. Even though the laughing did not feel good physically, it sure made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughing is like my brand of medicine for @CAPS6 I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster then any other over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first "love". "I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore", that was the last thing he said to me. My first "love" just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real break-up. I was having a pretty hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up. They told me that I needed to be cheered up. @CAPS6 we got into town we stopped by the store. My friend @PERSON3 told me to pick out a half gallon of ice-cream, so I got mint chocolate chip. We finally got to @PERSON3's house and he told me that I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream to myself. Of course I didn't argue. While I was eating the ice cream him and my friend @PERSON2 put on a little skit of how they were going to be up my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard I got a brain freeze. By the time the skit was over I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughing made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex we never hung out because i was always with him. I had a blast that day and I will remember it forever. Laughing is truly the key to living a great life. "@CAPS6 life gives you lemons make lemonade", that is a quote that I chose to listen to and try to follow. To me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life. So whenever I laugh, I am enjoying a little pleasures in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how hard life @MONTH1 seem. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS5, or i just got dumped; I laugh so that I don't have to worry anymore. Laughter is a main ingredient to everyone's life, don't forget it or life wont turn out the way that anyone would want it.   "

 Laughter. We all need it. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder that @CAPS7 is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, @CAPS8 a reminder that even though we @MONTH1 make mistakes, @CAPS7 is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   In the @DATE1, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children, of course, were not invited. We were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 was nothing to do. One of my best friends, @PERSON2, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five in the @TIME1, and I was to be back no later then nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before @CAPS1. Neither of us knew @CAPS13 to do with so much time on our hands. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This way new to both of us. We were both sophomores, and I had a crush on @LOCATION1. This turned out to be a big problem, considering @CAPS6 knew this piece of information. @CAPS6 didn't have a problem with it, but @PERSON1, her boyfriend, did. We got along, but he didn't like the fact that I was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't @CAPS7. He trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   We had decided to set up the @CAPS1 tree first, and go from @CAPS7. We both had @CAPS3, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. Tinsels, ornaments, pictures, @CAPS14 name it. It took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It looked magnificent when we were done. I'd help make some pretty @CAPS12 looking trees, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @PERSON2 got on the @CAPS4 to talk to @PERSON1 for a bit, while texted my girlfriend. I was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   @PERSON3 and I had been together for most of my sophomore year, and I was beginning to regret it. Our relationship had started when one of my buddies, @PERSON4, and hers ended. I know this sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I was putting myself between @PERSON4 and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @CAPS6 was like a bad drug that got @CAPS14 really high, and then dropped @CAPS14 like a rock. @CAPS6 was extremely controlling. @CAPS6 wasn't @CAPS12 for me, and @PERSON2 had finally convinced me that enough was enough. After I broke up with @PERSON3, I felt both happy, and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so alone. I'd never been @CAPS12 at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   Seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with @PERSON2. @CAPS6 knew me much better then most people, so @CAPS6 knew that I needed help quick. @CAPS6 did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @CAPS6 took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think it was a @CAPS12 idea. Her boyfriend was very protective of @PERSON2. He didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.   "@CAPS5 @CAPS14 please just try to relax for a minute? Your making me nervous." @CAPS6 said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question. Maybe it was the fact that I was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing really hard.   "@CAPS7. That wasn't so hard, was it?" @CAPS8 @CAPS6 pulled away from the embrace, I kissed forehead; our way of saying "your beautiful."   "@CAPS9 @CAPS14 going to be okay?" @CAPS6 asked in a worried voice.   "@CAPS11, I'll be fine. Thanks @PERSON2."   "@CAPS12. @CAPS14 never showed me that guitar thing."   "@CAPS13 guitar thing?"   "@CAPS14 said @CAPS14 played guitar." @CAPS15 then I realized that I might not ever get another friend @CAPS8 @CAPS12 @CAPS8 this one.   "@CAPS16 @CAPS11. Come on. I'll show @CAPS14 how to play @CAPS17 man."

 As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, "People that are happy are the ones people want to be." @CAPS1 by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It @MONTH1 be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring.

 Laughter is a mystery. Happens @CAPS2 ever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extream, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.  Around two months ago, in the cold @DATE1. It was my @NUM1 birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. @CAPS2 everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me whats going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddie @PERSON3 and my boyfriend @PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a @NUM1 pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed "@CAPS1 up the cars, and let's go!" @CAPS2 we approached the @ORGANIZATION1, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister in law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extream and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in peoples hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold,wet and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worse. Even now the shoes i was wearing are stained. @CAPS2 we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling outta my hair and clothing, the sauce steaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @MONTH1 think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS3 dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON3 threw nacho cheese at @LOCATION1, she threw chips at @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON3 tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs fer and in all the girls hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and @CAPS4 tree. So @PERSON3 finally said"@CAPS5 more nachos!"  @CAPS6 on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on @PERSON1 face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at @LOCATION2, she tossed it at @CAPS3 then @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON3 then @PERSON2. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @NUM3 live on @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't to pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ill see you @CAPS6, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and say nothing but huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken t.v. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH1 not see it right away. Though you will @CAPS2 you started laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on there faces. It @MONTH1 also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after them crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call @LOCATION3.

                              Laughter                               @PERSON1   Laughter has many benefits that make us have might make us have more distance in between two people or maybe make us have differenceses in between the relationships you have with people. But many other people believe and (think) that laughter is an important part of any relationship with your friends, family ect. Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit to us, and how it can also make us have distances from people, or how laughter works in between relashionships we have with friends. Many people think that it's really fun to laugh about simple things and thats me I can laugh for things that might not seem funning to others, but to me they might seem extremely funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But many other poeple don't consider laughter as funny, as many others. I believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express your self on things. Many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes. Thats the reason why I think it's a great idea or (thing) to do around, just have some fun and laugh. Now talking about relashionship in between people. Do you think that laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how could it help us (ways)????? Well yes I do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationship we have with people. You get to know and others get to know about you and how you are.  Eventhough many relationships that we have with our friends, family, or with new people we meet. I believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses how that person is and wheither they are fun people to be around. Laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or doesn't have any humor at all. When people don't have that much humor they really don't understand and get the funny parts from jokes or anything. I also think that laughter is really important to any type of relationship you have with anybody, because that makes you know that person a lot better. But other people consider laughter being a reason that distances two people from each other.I don't considerlaughter being a reason for to people to have distances in between. The reasons why I think and say this is becasue their are many people that laugh a lot almost crying and they don't have distances in between other people or anything. They might get more friends or more people to talk to them becasue other people as well might see how that person is and they might see that the person is really fun to be around with. I know this becasue I laugh a lot and that hasn't happened to me. Thats why I don't consider and don't believe that laughter is being the reason to have distances in between people (relationship). In my opinion I consider laughter a very important part of who we are, the way we think, and also the things we like to do. What I mean by this is that you can have some humor but you don't actually express the way you are thinking about what other do. Or if something is super silly and theirs a new kid at school and you or someone else says something you might probably think that it's funny but you might just not want to laugh at that moment becasue you @MONTH1 a little to shy or simply becasuue you might not know that person as well and maybe the other person won't have enough confidence to laugh with you for whatever silly thing someone just said. Although many people still should laugh whenever they want. Sometimes if you laugh a lot you might be the happiest and funniest person anywhere. Or whenever somebody is sad you might as well be the only person theri who can make her/him laugh and happy. In addition these were some of the reasons why i think that laughter is great for you, that way people will get to know you better. These were a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit,how it can distance people.

          There are times I get along with others and times I don't. There also are times where I make others laugh until they cry. Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS6 he was doing in there, and he said. "I'm taking a pee." @CAPS2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss @CAPS6 we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of @CAPS6 the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @CAPS5 gets up and says to us. "@CAPS4 you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second." @CAPS5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. "@CAPS6 about me? How come I don't get a hug." That when I started to laugh harder @CAPS2 heck. Good thing I did not have to go to the rest room.

@CAPS4 fills the air around us with happiness and joy, @CAPS4 brings warm memory's of loved ones that are close to us , and adds a splash of hope to those who need @CAPS4. Laughter is the key to solving life's problems.@CAPS4 is a way of adding something special into our life and comes from many different areas of life .Laughter could come from a pitiful joke that someone could have told you,@CAPS4 could be brought up by a show, and @CAPS4 could also come from the joy we get when a near loved one has returning home from a long journey. Imagine seeing something comical like a person falling down or crashing into a pole , the moment right when that happens you hear your self laughing as hard as you can that you practically cant breath and the person standing right next to you is joining in on the laugh. Although @CAPS3 might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you. @CAPS3 is how friendships are brought up and made, just by one little thing that made you both laugh and have a connection with each other can trigger a brand new friendship between to people that could either last a minute or can last a life time. In my case @CAPS3 is how I met one of my closest friend ever , we had seen a student from our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the flag pole and replace the @ORGANIZATION1 state flag with his own personal home made flag ( he got the @CAPS1 off of a show ) ,as he was heading up the pole almost half way their he must have gotten scared because minutes later he started yelling for help, a minute later the faculty members finally heard his cry's and yells and tried to get him down from ware he was, @CAPS4 took them almost half an hour to get him down. @CAPS3 was the moment ware I had made one of the greatest friendship I've ever had in my life. Many friendships are made in class and with the people you go to work with but a great friendship is brought up by a simple laugh two people share with each other. God laugh's last. @CAPS3 is the name of @PERSON1 son of @CAPS2 and @PERSON2. In @CAPS3 story @PERSON2 the @CAPS5 of @PERSON1 claimed that she was surprised when she was blessed with her only child and that people would laugh and be surprised the same way she was when they hear the news. Being surprised or shocked can also bring some one to laugh at what either happened in their surroundings or what they did them self's. I remembered a time ware I laughed at something that took me by surprise, @CAPS4 was when my @CAPS5 lost the keys to the house inside the car, we looked for them every ware but had no luck finding them, after an hour had pass we called my dad so he would bring the other key to the house, after we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get their but as soon as my father parked in the driveway my @CAPS5 found the key that she lost inside her pocket (@CAPS4 was a typical cartoon moment).When we heard the news we all just started laughing at what has just happen, we were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened. As you can see being surprise can also bring a smile and a laugh onto someones face. Picture yourself staring into the eyes of some one close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out the slightest bit of a giggle or a smile and then find yourself laughing nonstop for no reason. That is basically an every day thing for me and my sister. My sister and I can't stare at each other for even a minute, we eventually start laughing the first five seconds and end up laughing a hole hour without stop, but as soon as we stop laughing we note's that we were laughing for no apparent reason , which would make us laugh for another hour more.That the kind of laughter that two people that are so close to each other get , the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh but you end up laughing for no reason at all.@CAPS3 shows the connection two people have with each other the type ware you know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memory's of family gatherings for the holidays , friendships we made when we were in school , memory's of our childhood and how thing we thought then were in style and cool are k now thing we look back into and laugh at, by being a little surprise, and can also be The fact that we know someone by heart .

 LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.

Laughter's @CAPS1 Laughter is everywhere. It @MONTH1 be three doors down reclining in a comfy living room. It @MONTH1 be at the nearest playground bouncing on the teeter-totter. It @MONTH1 be at an elegant restaurant sitting at a petite table in the distant corner. For me, it lingered in an old fifth grade classroom. I stumbled through the doorway carrying @CAPS11 purple backpack and @CAPS11 lunch pale resting in @CAPS11 left hand. I recognized everyone from @CAPS11 previous years of elementary school, and shortly joined them after visiting @CAPS11 hook outside the door. I had been waiting anxiously for @CAPS11 turn at the fifth grade. The legendary @PERSON1, was known as the "coolest" teacher around. He played a large role in the gossip of the young students, and each of us had our hopes set high. "@CAPS2 your seats @NUM1 graders!" announced @PERSON1 @CAPS3 with a contagious smile. Kids scattered around to room searching for seats near their closest friends. Everyone listened attentively to @PERSON1's introduction to the year. His voice caught our full attention, but not too exciting compared to our expectations. He appeared very nice as most teachers come, but still nothing spectacular. The day dragged on. The sleepy faces returned and the vivid colors had escaped our touch. The day finally reached an end, not satisfying the eager children. The next day rose quickly and I trudged back to the disappointing classroom. To @CAPS11 surprise, the next day was nothing like the first. The classroom @CAPS7 experienced a drastic change. Every wall was filled with endless color. Posters layered over the plain paint with fascinating pictures and words. A fancy popcorn machine rested in the back of the room. Fresh popcorn overflowed from inside. The smell traveled through our needy nostrils as we entered. Mr. @CAPS3 sat contently at his broad desk as we made our way to our seats once again. He welcomed us to our second day. After the first couple minutes of class I had found that the rumors were true. He had a sense of simple humor that created giggles in every corner of the class. His ideas and word choice related to us as @NUM1 graders. We found his subtle jokes quite amusing to our young minds. He spoke like we spoke, he acted like we acted, and he joked like we joked. He even created customized nicknames for each of us. Laughter hung over our heads like a heavy @CAPS1, never continuing along. Weekly popcorn servers would hand out stuffed bags to all the kids as the class read aloud. Kids became ecstatic on jeopardy @CAPS4 gathering teams as quick as possible. His classroom became a place that we wanted to stay forever, never parting from hour long games and water chugging contests. Despite the everlasting fun and games, @PERSON1 showed us what it was really like to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to strive in every moment of life. He taught us to write with desire and worth. To express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story that we want heard. He would plan one on one time with students struggling in a particular subject, and next class their confidence had bloomed. He had an ability to reach into our minds, find out who we were, and emerge that hidden confidence to become @CAPS9. We respected him, yet felt comfortable messing around with him during class as he had frequently done to us. @PERSON1 gave us a craving to learn.  @DATE1 @TIME1, I had began to walk home, when @PERSON1 @CAPS3 stopped me at the door.  "@CAPS6 @PERSON2C!" I unexpectedly said in a high tone, not hiding @CAPS11 enthusiasm. He chuckled, "@CAPS7 fun at class today?" "@CAPS8 yeah," I answered with a grin. "I'm glad" he continued, then changing the subject, "I was thinking about having a huge dodge ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Do @CAPS10 think that would be a good idea?" I snickered to myself, trying to comprehend the fact that an adult had said this to me, "That would be so fun." "@CAPS9," he expressed quite excited, "@CAPS10 are a really neat kid, @CAPS10 know that? Its a lot of fun having @CAPS10 in class." @CAPS11 face lit up. I stood there smiling for quite some time. We finished our slight conversation and I continued home. Every student in the class yearned to be liked by @PERSON1, as if he were the most popular kid at school. I was liked by @PERSON2 I was liked by the man that changed @CAPS11 whole outlook on education and life. Gradually, from time to time, I drift back to the careless days of @NUM1 grade and @PERSON2 I still laugh at the ridiculous events that occurred in that small classroom each and every day. Frequently, I glance above me to witness that dense @CAPS1 that still hovers above me. Laughter has left a mark on me, and those kids of @CAPS11 @NUM1 grade class.

 Laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others. It lightens the mood of any situation and can really lift my sprits when I'm having a bad day. It is often the ice breaker when I meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends I already have.  On the first day of school, freshman year, I met a girl named @LOCATION1. We were in writing class and there was a boy named @CAPS1 sitting between us. @CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedules, and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomforatable. I looked up and saw that @LOCATION1 had heard what he had said and had a look on her face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and close to laughing. I smiled at her and mouthed the word "awkward" when @CAPS1 turned away. This was her cue that it was okay to laugh, and she did so subtly. I didn't know that this first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly. After the first week of schedules being changed and students being shuffled around, we found out that we had every single one of our classes together, except @CAPS3. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done, and I'm not exactly sure how we managed to pass all our classes. Spending so much time together, it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill up a dictionary. Nearly any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can send us into a fit of laughter. Sometimes, we don't have to say anything at all. I'll just look at her, and we'll burst out laughing. Because of this, our friends often question our sanity. When we start laughing, they'll look at eachother, and then at us for a clue as to why, or ask if we are okay. They don't understand us the way we understand eachother. People always get our names mixed up even though we look nothing alike. Our names dont even rhyme, or start with the same letter. But I can't really blame them. We're so much alike! From the activities we participate in to the way we think, we could almost be the same person. She makes me laugh every single day, and she's one of my best friends. @CAPS4 is another one of my friends who is constantly making me crack up. Whenever I'm with her, I'm always terrified of peeing in my pants. She's not as close to me as @LOCATION1 is, but we've gotten to be such better friends this year. We have a lot of classes together this year, and that's probably why we've gotten closer. We're always doing stupid stuff together, and laughing about it the whole time. For example, she and I like to laugh obnoxiously loud and exaggerate our "ha's" when someone tells a really lame or cheesy joke. Our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes, so when we're in his class, we sit together anticipating one of his jokes so that we can laugh. We also like to chew our gum with our mouths open, in order to make the chewing noise louder. I often laugh so hard that I can't even chew. I know I'll have a good day if I'm with @CAPS4. She can make me laugh in a way a lot of my other friends can't. It comes deep from within, to the point where you can't even breathe, and tears and running down your face. It makes your entire face is sore, even your eyes, from being scrunched up for so long. She's such a fun person to be around, and I'm glad to have her as one of my friends. Laughing is a very important part in the relationships I have with other people. If my friends couldn't make me laugh, our friendship would be so much more boring. Nothing would be fun. If I never laughed, I'd never be happy, and that's not a life I'm willing to try. Life is hard. It's not easy, and it's not always going to be smiles and smooth sailing. There's going to be sadness and rough waters. But no matter how tough this life @MONTH1 get, I know I'll have friends like @LOCATION1 and @CAPS4 there to share a laugh.

 Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 "language" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a "bunny trail" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving "black eyes" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, "@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill." @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  "That only happenedone time!"@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. "@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!" "I didn't tell the world," I objected. "I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on."@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, "@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about." The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. "@CAPS8," @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same "language."

The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter, one of the best feelings an individual can achieve. When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH1 not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter-filled relationships is an important element to someone's well being. Sharing a @CAPS3 is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled "I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3." I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS3 when someone else is laughing. Everyone has their own @CAPS3 too. Sometimes, it is someone's @CAPS3 that provokes laughter within the group. Making others @CAPS3 is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS3. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman @CAPS4' book, "Laughter is the best medicine" explains the powers of laughter in detail. @CAPS4 watched The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and laughed himself to wellness. He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life.

 In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for what ever reason it @MONTH1 be. those are the @NUM3 thing i think you need to have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i will never be able to lose it no matter how hard i try to i now she will always be by my side.

 Bell rings.  Shuffle, shuffle. @CAPS1. Snap. EEEE. Crack. Slam. Click, stomp, @CAPS1. Tap tap tap. SLAM. Creak. Shoof, shoof.  Sigh. Seventh class of the day. Here we go. "@CAPS2! Tu va ou pas? On a +¬tude cette class-l+á. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...." @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate-haired and mocha skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. It made no difference to them if I trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy. I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds, and were then forgotten about.  I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home.  But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS3 walked down the three-person wide staircase side-by-side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUM2scalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS3 weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them?   I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing.  This caught the interest of @PERSON1, as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS6. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON1 just stared at them as @CAPS3 darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table.  And then, we laughed.  We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst and lonliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life.  Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came.  Bell rings.

 I didn't believe my grandfather when @CAPS2 told me laughing could cure anything. I was nine years old, the days were dark @CAPS3 cold @CAPS3 I felt like my life was a shattered piece of a stain glass window. Not only had @PERSON2, my ageless pit bull, just died @CAPS6 also my little sister would tease me if I dared to shed a tear for the lost of my best pet. I sat on the coach, staring at the fire as it crackled @CAPS3 popped, when my grandfather sat down beside me @CAPS3 told me a story. It was about him, when @CAPS2 was young @CAPS3 how lost @CAPS1 best friend too, only @CAPS1 friend wasn't a pet. "@CAPS1 name was @PERSON3," @CAPS2 began, "@CAPS3 we were eleven years old. Oh, how we had so much fun. All we did was @CAPS7! We thought we were gonna grow old together @CAPS3 be each others best men @CAPS3 cause trouble tell the end. @CAPS2 was my best friend until the end. I loved him, very much like how you love @PERSON2. I never thought anything would happen to him. I thought that we'd both live forever. @CAPS6 then something did happened. @PERSON3, @CAPS2 had gone fishing alone because I was at church @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @CAPS4 had to work, @CAPS3 it was such a wonderful day to @CAPS11 down to the river @CAPS6 then @CAPS2 never came back from the river..." @CAPS5 sniffled at the old story, " @CAPS6 you see, @PERSON1, there's a cure for sadness. Do you want to know @CAPS9 it is?" I nodded half thinking there was a magical medication or spell. "@CAPS7." @CAPS2 said. "@CAPS9?!" I was utterly shocked. "@CAPS10, it's simply," @CAPS2 said gently, knowing my easy temper, "@CAPS11 through the stages of grieving. Feel lost for a little bit, @CAPS6 then find your way back home. @CAPS7 is in your heart @CAPS3 always will be. Find a wave of joy @CAPS3 @CAPS11 with the flow. Love life, because, as you have just seen, it can be so short." I nodded @CAPS6 didn't look at @CAPS1 sober face. @CAPS2 kissed the top of my head. @CAPS2 looked into my eyes ( I didn't dare meet the intensity of @CAPS1) @CAPS3 I knew @CAPS2 saw the reflection of the fire blazing in my watery green blue eyes @CAPS3 could see my processing @CAPS9 @CAPS2 had just told me. Then @CAPS2 left me alone to think. I needed to move on? How? Life wasn't that easy. I knew that. I opened up my note book to do some homework to get my mind off @PERSON2, @CAPS5, @CAPS3 @PERSON3. That's when I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I flipped it over, showing that it was a picture. A tear leaked out of the corner of eye. It was of me @CAPS3 @PERSON2. We were both in a mud pit. My blond hair looked like dirt ( considering that I had been rolling in mud). My pit bull was rubbing @CAPS1 greasy head on my shoulder smearing more mud on to myself. I smiled, missing him even more, @CAPS6 feeling a lot better then a minute before. I loved him. I loved him so much. I still do this day, @CAPS6 I had to get over that my friend was gone. After I saw the picture, I had laughed to myself, automatically feeling better about being such a horrid granddaughter @CAPS3 a inconsiderate best friend. @CAPS6 seeing the good times we had, @CAPS3 smiling, made me honestly feel better about myself. Huh? Maybe laughter is the cure for anything.

 The bus flew around tightly wound corners. Beyond the windows, farmland, rocky bluffs, and peaceful rivers streamed past. Exhausted from the fourteen hour flight, I barely knew what time it was. The only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and @NUM1 other @CAPS1 I barely knew gossiping quietly. We were going to visit and live with a group high school students, affectionately referred to as "our @CAPS2." I had met @CAPS16 partner, @LOCATION1, only once. Everything I knew about her, her life, her family I learned from maybe ten, maybe @NUM2 short @CAPS3 messages. Communication was going to be problematic. @CAPS16 mother started teaching me @CAPS4 when I turned two, but I was nowhere near fluent; I was self-conscience and uncomfortable around native speakers. @PERSON1's @CAPS5 was decent, but her family spoke only @CAPS4. Finally, the bus drove down the narrow cobbled streets of @CAPS7. It pulled up to a plaza packed with people. The doors hissed open, and we filed out into the crowd, standing on tiptoes to search for our new families. All around me, people chattered in a mix of @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERSON1 and her parents waited somewhere in the middle, and I slowly wove @CAPS16 way towards them. Brigitte, @CAPS16 host mother, grabbed me in a hug. "@CAPS10 gehts? @CAPS10 war dein @PERSON2? How @CAPS18 you? How was your flight?"  @CAPS11 of @CAPS16 @CAPS4, I faltered, "@CAPS13 @PERSON2 war sehr langalso ich bin ein bisschen muede. The flight was very long, so I'm a little tired." @PERSON1 took @CAPS16 arm and led me uphill towards the school, where our welcome dinner was being held. She explained, "@CAPS14 is very excited to meet you. @CAPS7 is so small; we never get tourists. We only get @CAPS15 exchange students every other year." @CAPS16 stomach was filled with that jittery-sick feeling of nervous anticipation. Normally, making friends was easy for me, but this time was different. I only minimally understood the language and culture of the people surrounding me. The long flight was evident in the sleepless bags under @CAPS16 eyes and @CAPS16 greasy, knotted hair. @CAPS16 jet-lagged brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in, be able to slip into @CAPS4 life without many hitches or snags? We passed from the antiquated street to a dusky tunnel-like entryway. After a few turns, we emerged into an open courtyard. An array of food covered several tables, and the scent of grilling bratwurst wafted through the air. "@CAPS18 you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here," @PERSON1 told me. I grabbed a plate and placed a roll, strawberries, and a sausage on it; I was too anxious to really be hungry. @PERSON1 steered me towards a worn table with wooden benches, where her friends were already enjoying dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I perched stiffly on the edge of the seat. @CAPS14 talked excitedly, questioning me about @CAPS15 life. As @CAPS14 loosened up, they began to joke, sometimes in @CAPS4, sometimes in @CAPS5. Some of the @CAPS2 teased me about @CAPS16 accent. It wasn't a mean teasing; they weren't trying to be malicious, just light and funny. So I laughed. In that moment, I seemed to fit better with these people I only sometimes understood. I was less a foreigner and more a new friend. Relaxing, I allowed myself to laugh at @CAPS16 mistakes and really enjoy being someplace entirely new.

 My friend @PERSON1 and I have @CAPS1 friends from as back as sixth grade. We have @CAPS1 through so much together. Even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out, out side of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. I say that if you are gonna have a friendship that is gonna last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON1 and I where in @NUM1 grade, we where the biggest people to the sixth graders because we where in the highest grade in our middle school. We would have so much stuff to do. @PERSON1 and I would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone. That someone would plow into a locker or wall and we would just laugh are butts off. It was fun to us but the other people kinda minded, but not that bad.  Another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @PERSON1 and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @PERSON1 would tickle me. @PERSON1 new that I'm like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. Well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. Well @PERSON1 was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @PERSON1 told me that she just said "@CAPS3" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started off of laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher had assigned seats and @PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did I. Well the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS4 class and I told my teacher I wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere ells. He told me yes and so I went over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn't care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  So you see. Laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life's. You need it. Without it I would of never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably. Just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life.

 I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them. After first half we scored @NUM1 goals so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.

 Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @CAPS7 fall @CAPS3 their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how @CAPS7 fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life that their isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and @CAPS7 always make me laugh. Their isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say "awkward silence." We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call "good times." I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1 and sat down @CAPS3 a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said "@CAPS2 @CAPS3." I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS3, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS3 the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell "@ORGANIZATION2", with two guys wearing black @CAPS3 each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling "@CAPS8"! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling "@CAPS9"! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness.

 Laughter is a great thing, except for some instances. We all have been there. Having a good time with friends, laughing and making new memories. Then you take a drink of something and start laughing again. Next thing you know you're choking and can't breathe. You're coughing as much as you can, trying to stop. It's not only a little embarrassing, but it can get a little awkward too. You can't stop it, you just have to let nature take its course. Everyone stares, asking if you're alright. The moment feels like forever, and that was exactly how I felt. I have two best friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. It was during the @DATE1 and we decided to have ourselves a little movie night at @ORGANIZATION3's house. We were fully prepared with candy, soda pops, and the best of all, pizza. It all added up for a great night. We decided to watch the movie @ORGANIZATION1. It's all of our favorites, I don't think we could ever grow tired of it. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and I found comfortable seating arrangements and started to watch the movie. We were eating, laughing hard-core and making comments along with it. We were having a great time. Then I decided to take a drink of my @ORGANIZATION2. I was about to swallow it, but just my luck, one of the funniest parts in the movie was on. I started to laugh and knew I had an issue. I put my cup on the table, quickly got off the couch, and took two steps when most of the @LOCATION1 in my mouth came flying out onto the floor. I couldn't breathe and was now coughing, so I kept running to my destination, the kitchen sink. I was about two feet away from the sink, I was so close! Then I felt something come up my mouth that I couldn't control. I wasn't going to open my mouth, it'd be all over the floor! I was so grossed out I basically threw myself at the sink. My mouth opened and there went the puke, into the sink. I continued to cough, wondering when it would it would all end. "@CAPS2 you okay?!" @CAPS1 ran into the kitchen and started hitting my upper back, trying to help me out. @CAPS5 hit me three times, then I could finally breathe again. "@CAPS4 you, I was having a hard time." @CAPS5 started laughing, while I was still disgusted with the nasty taste left in my mouth. I put my head under the faucet trying to clear it out a little. I grabbed a towel, and we made our way to the living room. We entered the room to find @PERSON1 sitting on the couch, laughing hysterically. @CAPS1 sat by her, and started to giggle a little along with her. I got on my knees and started wiping up the @ORGANIZATION2 spill on the floor. There wasn't too much, but still a good amount. I started to chuckle a little to myself while cleaning it up. I thought to myself, "@CAPS6 must I always be the one to choke?" "@CAPS6 didn't you just go to the bathroom sink? I mean it's right there!" @PERSON1 was pointing to the door and still laughing. "I didn't think of that! I just ran for the kitchen!" I've been to her house plenty of times before, but the bathroom slipped my mind. I laughed at how much of a blond moment I had just had. "@CAPS8 my gosh," @CAPS5 laughed a little then continued, "@CAPS9 me of @CAPS10! When I saved you!" "@CAPS11 up and watch the movie!" I told her jokingly. @CAPS5 finished laughing and we were enjoying the movie in peace again. They both still tease me about that, but I don't mind. It just goes to show you the things laughter can unexpectedly bring.

 Has there ever been a person that you know, that just made you laugh like no one else could? Or had a moment or a @DATE1 when you laughed as if there was no tomorrow? Laughter is something that everyone can relate to no matter the age or the personality. It fills you with warm feeling that spills out like a waterfall. There isn't always a reason for the things that people do, there is always mystery. The same thing applies to laughter. Sometimes you are just so happy that it all builds up inside and has to be let out. During the @DATE2 of my sixth, going on seventh grade year, my friend @PERSON1 and I were nearly inseparable. @PERSON1 was the first friend that I had made upon moving from @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 in the beginning of my sixth grade year, but in a short amount of time we became best friends. On @DATE1, we were at my house by ourselves and we wanted to do something fun, and creative. So we decided to make a fort out of sheets and furniture. We took chairs and the ends of some couches and @DATE1 tables and tied sheets and blankets from them, falling over ourselves and not paying attention to anything else. We made a plane of fabric about three or four feet above the ground, tall enough to crawl under and sit down. We then took a tack in the wall and pinned a sheet to hang over the flat sheet as our walls. We then filled the make shift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on. By the @DATE1 of our adventure, the living room was a mess and the furniture was all over the place. It was as if a tornado had run through the house, even though it wasn't the biggest or best fort we had built. But we didn't care, we had a blast building it. I remember sitting in the fort and talking to her about anything that came up. We talked about school, people and just life in general. We made jokes like we love to do and just fed off of each others good feelings and energy. I was on cloud nine and no one was about to bring me down. That @DATE1, I laughed like there was nothing wrong in the world. I was carefree and wasn't afraid to show it. We were both laughing almost constantly to the point of tears, even though, when I look back now some of the things that we laughed about, weren't all that funny. It was one of those days with the laughs that fill you up with so much energy and joy that you can't even contain yourself, and it is so contagious that others can't help but join you. We let ourselves out in cries of joy and cackles. I had never laughed so hard in my life and I never wanted it to stop. It wasn't necessarily because of something funny that @PERSON1 had done or said, but I was just so happy that everything seemed worthy of laughing about. And every time I started to laugh, she couldn't help but join me, and that would just set us off laughing harder. By the @DATE1, we were both emotionally drained. @PERSON1 ended up staying the night because we never wanted the @DATE1 to leave. But, eventually, every @DATE1 ends, every morning is a new beginning and every night an @DATE1 to something, but when you close your eyes to sleep after a long @DATE1 of laughing, you feel full. Not of happiness, but of life. And that feeling, is not something that is easily taken away. So live and laugh like today is the last @DATE1, and never forget the memories that you created in the times before.

         The @CAPS1 Of Laughter In @CAPS2 @CAPS3 me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @CAPS3 listen and pay attention. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our @CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. One memory I always seem @CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   There have been many memories made between @PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE1 we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parent's had decided that they wanted @CAPS3 take a trip @CAPS3 the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS3 go with their family @CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS3 the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out @CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE1 whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned @CAPS3 work together and it helped our @CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got @CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That @DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS3 laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my @CAPS2 with @PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great.

Iv always loved laughter in my life, I don't know how I could live with out it. This is how it all started out. One day, I was not having a good day. Nothing could have made me laugh. Friends would tell my jokes, they would make funny faces. That just did'nt make me laugh one bit. There was just that one thing they have'nt tried that made me laugh, until my sister completed that one thing. I would never forget this day when my sister and I had a water balloon fight. On a hot @DATE1 day my sister and I would always play water balloon fights, this one time she through one water balloon and it hit my face. I also through one water balloon and guess what happen it hit her face. We just could not stop laughing, we were just breathless from all that laugher. My sister desided to tell me that story when I was not having a good day, even when people tried to make it better by making me laugh. The one thing no one said was that one time during the @DATE1. Until my sister reminded me of it and told me that story. I just start laughing from that day on. Then my sister took me outside, she had all the water balloons ready, we start throughing them at eachother . That day when i was not good day turned out to be the best day of my life. Thats a day I would never forget from laughter. Thats why I love laughter in my life, it just makes my not good days turn to the best day of my life.

One day me and my friend taylor got the idea on a snow day to get his quad and tie a rope to the back he was drifting around a post he didnt see the hill and i was on the back on a slead and i flew over the quad and got about @NUM1 feet high then crashed it hurt but it was so funny we both couldnt stop laughing for ten min.then we went back to his creek it was frozen about @NUM2 inch thick then i was drven the quad and he was in the back i was driving along the bank and he was on the ice then it started to crack so i went faster so he didnt fall in then after about two min the ice cracked and he went under then i got him out and i drove as fast as the quad could go and got back to his house he changed and then he just sat there and laughted for hours about what we both did.

  In any situation laughter is used. Many times have I been in an awkward position that i have used laughter to free myself from discomfort. Laughter will never go away and you will always have it with you to use when it is needed in a revolting moment. For example, @CAPS1 a month ago i was walking to the park with my brother and some friends of mine. When we arrived there were already people at the skateboarding spot we wanted to skate at. We decided no big deal we will just go on with our business and skate. "@CAPS2 punks! we were here first!" one of them said. Me and my brother started yelling back. Then one of them got in my face and started talking a bunch of trash so i said something @CAPS1 him that was so funny that all his friends laughed to. He was pretty pissed of but it didn't matter because we ended up skating there anyway and nothing went down.  This just comes to show that laughter can bring us all together at any giving moment. No matter the skin color or were your from you can always be funny. Some people my be funnier than others but everyone has a sense of humor within them. You can always find the time to make a joke or come up with a clever hilarious line for some one to laugh there brains out at. Laughter is the one thing you can count on in an awkward position or when you go to a new school or have never been somewhere before. Laughter can always keep you out of fights no matter what. All around the world people are laughing at this very moment and bonding by it. It is the sign of happiness and gratefulness. Laughter has a purpose and will never disappear.Laughter is bonding. Bonding is loving. Laughter is together.

 As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we cant live without it. Its one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times, and the joy of life. So when people say "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people", well there right! You can think anything you want to, but i want you to know that i have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy i have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION2 inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably to nice for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice we go ahead and swim in the pool, even know we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because in was way to cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell there just sitting there pretending to mind there own business, and i know for a fact that's not why. We talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and i hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME1 and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say good bye for ever. Me and @PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had know idea that @PERSON3 gave my number to @PERSON1, the guy i kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later i get a text saying "meet me outside to walk around". So i amused that it was him, and i got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for the @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like i could con-core everything that came my way.  About forty five minutes past, still gazing into each others eyes, feeling like it as only been a second. His friend @PERSON2 sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom. They bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have i experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all i understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS1 and i live in @LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day i will meet him again. Maybe someday i would be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME1, and just maybe, will i fall in love with him. All those maybe's have came true, because i fallowed what was right and i waited. Now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life.

 I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  "@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student." @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, "@CAPS3, that would be me."  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, "I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class."  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  "@CAPS5, hello?" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. "I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7." @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, "@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you."  "@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, "@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before."  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  "@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school." I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, "@CAPS12 need to lie,"  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, "@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along.

 I'm a tell you about moments sometimes even adventures with a boy named @CAPS1.C. @CAPS4 has brown hair that is up to his neck, that @CAPS4 loves to swoosh around like in the movies. @CAPS4 most definitely doesn't like his bangs cut to short other wise the swoosh will not turn out the same way. @CAPS4 has brown eyes that just seem to sparkle and a smile that seems to fool everyone. "@CAPS2, @CAPS4's so adorable", they say."@CAPS2, @CAPS4 so cute", they say.@CAPS1.C is cute, but does things that will amaze you! Things you wouldn't think a kid his age could make possible. Like i always say, "@CAPS4'll make you work for your money!"The thing is @CAPS4's only @NUM1 years of age, well right now @CAPS17. @CAPS4 loves the attention, @CAPS4'll do almost anything for it. Yet @CAPS4's very lovable and sometimes sweet.@CAPS4 loves comedy, cartoons, candy, video games, the works. @CAPS1.C is lots of fun believe me when i say you'll never get bored! I think when @CAPS4 was @NUM2 1/@NUM2 when the adventures began. @CAPS4 would always go in the refrigerator and just @CAPS8 at the egg cartons and double check if anyone was around. Then @CAPS4'd grab one and toss it and say, "@CAPS5, chicken?" with a baby type accent, so adorable! but @CAPS4'd try another and another and another until all the eggs were splattered all over the place. @CAPS4'd run off knowing we're coming to close to him and hide. I must admit i didn't know who was doing all this at first. I kind of thought it was @CAPS1.C, but wasn't too sure. That was only one mischief.@CAPS4 also loved this aquarium that was there, very bright because of the light it just seem to attract him. @CAPS4'd get closer and closer and just @CAPS8 at the fishes. Watching them swim, all the different pretty colors. The rocks and the little toys seemed to attract him more. When @CAPS5 one was around @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 above the tank and stick his hand in very carefully and say,"@CAPS7!"trying to attempt to grab it, but @CAPS5 success. When @CAPS4 heard that someone was coming or getting closer to him @CAPS4'd run so fast like the bird cartoon from loony toons always out smarting the coyote. There would be a mess, of course. Though everyone knew @CAPS4'd be trouble once @CAPS4'd start walking! @CAPS4 was so cute though.Now when @CAPS4 was between the ages @NUM4 and @NUM5, @CAPS4 just loved picking at people just for the fun of it, or so we thought. @CAPS4 do it for the attention so we'd go drop what were doing and go run after him. What @CAPS4'd do was grab something that was valuable to a certain person and go up to them and say, "@CAPS8! me have, me have."Of course, we had to go run after him, but sometimes you'd have to be careful because if not @CAPS4'd toss if and wham! It would brake. there's only a few things I'm pointing out here, but in reality there was much more and it was ore exciting then might be explaining it! age @NUM5 was a workout! One day we decide to lend @CAPS1.C our @CAPS10 touch to entertain him because we were busy doing our own things and @CAPS1.C discovers you tube! @CAPS4 loves this show called @CAPS12 and @CAPS13! In other words @CAPS4 calls it, "@CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS16."@CAPS17 @CAPS4'd go on it and watch most of the t.v shows on the @CAPS10 touch and use the apps on it! @CAPS4 is very smart when it comes to using electronics if i @MONTH1 add. The day after that @CAPS4'd ask for the @CAPS10 touch almost frequently then every time @CAPS4 was denied of using it, @CAPS4'd go to his methods in getting it! Of course what @CAPS4 did was, when lights were out and everyone was asleep @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 all over, when finally @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 under the pillows and grab them and take it with him. The very next morning we were after him! @CAPS4 told us, but yet again @CAPS4 would do it! Then we went to drastic measures we hid the @CAPS10 touches else where. now at @NUM1 years of age! whoa, well @CAPS5 in my opinion I think @CAPS4 calmed down a little more. Others @MONTH1 not think so, but i know so! Anyways @CAPS4 is now @NUM1 which means @CAPS4 is now starting school! which i hear is quite entertaining for those who are not involved! They love @CAPS1.C but sometimes @CAPS4 can be a little too much, ha. @CAPS4 loves roaming around doing what @CAPS4 loves most and just having a great time, which i admire. well if i were to say one little short story about him as a @NUM1 year old I'd pick, how @CAPS5 matter what @CAPS4'd always defend his brothers! @CAPS4 wont let @CAPS5 one bully his brothers, @CAPS5 matter what the odds! i admire most about him is that!

 Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is to become amused or derisive. Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Through many relationships no matter what kind, I believe laughter takes up at least @PERCENT1 of your relationship. It's to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening. There are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter. "I'm sure you can even think of one".  In my views of this world and our society today, I believe laughter is what makes up our "human" spirit. It's to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us. Have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh? I have asked myself this same question over and over. For me making people laugh is letting them know I care and to also think I'm funny as well. We even do it just the fact of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go to the extremes of being to funny, and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way.  I remember in the eighth grade, I was thirteen years old. I was really shy and didn't have much friends. One day in class some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me. I was @CAPS1 excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what anyone else was saying. Then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time, because some of the things she was saying were true. That's were I messed up, I started talking about all the other dumb things she did, just to make everybody else laugh. As I was sitting there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just to try and make myself popular. Later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do that to her. I told her I was sorry and that I only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids. We didn't talk for almost two weeks. @CAPS1 I tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back. It did take me awhile, but she finally came around and forgave me. It was a good life lesson for me, knowing laughter @MONTH1 not always be a good thing. Now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day. We both together can share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down. I have experienced these things as well in my life time. Laughter has made me stronger and to be a better person, even if it means turning down popular kids @CAPS1 you don't hurt those closest to you."@CAPS1 go out and make somebody laugh today".

 Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time.

 Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, "you need a sense of humor, you know?" @CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS1 moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS1 I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS1 it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS1 getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile.

 In a relationship you should be able to trust in each other, confide in each other, talk with each other, cry with each other and most importantly laugh with each other. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can definitely agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend, and boyfriend, @PERSON2. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days he can find a smile and a little giggle. I constantly thank @CAPS1 for putting him in my life.  The first thing that I really noticed about @PERSON2 when I started to get to know him better, is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he is making totally weird faces at me or tickling me until I can barely breath, he always knows how to get me laughing. When I am balling my eyes out to him, even then he can get me to giggle. Just @TIME1 I had had a terrible day at school and within a few minutes of me crying to him, he had cheered me up and got me to laugh. In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a face and start laughing, there's something about those blue eyes and that dorky smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning. When we play @CAPS2, or he plays and I fail at attempting to play, we always laugh at how bad I am at it, or when I finally do get an awesome kill. "That just works out, don't it!" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny but we have fun competing at who can say it the most in one day. The rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets "the point" (as if we actually keep score) but that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use. When ever there is a camera around @PERSON2 likes to make funny faces, which will always get me laughing. Then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too, they do say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at your self. One time, @PERSON2 his little sisters, @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 and I were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short I kneed myself in the forehead, @PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force, and he just got silent until I started cracking up. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were goofing around on the hard wood floor at his house and I pushed him to the ground, his whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red, but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off.  Even when things get rough our you disagree on something it is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other. Just because @PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree about a lot of things most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger. At times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one, we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject. Both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh.  Obviously I have reason too agree with the statement "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" because I have that connection in the best way possible. I am so thankful to have @PERSON2 in my life, his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between "@CAPS3" over a text message, cracking up at weird things we do or just watching a movie, we are always laughing at each other or with each other. As we both would put it "were freaking soul mates!"

 Every day I spend with my girlfriend is a day full of fun and laughter. I can be in the worst of moods and she can brighten my whole day with @CAPS1 a couple of words. Together we can chane any situation into a happy one. What i'm trying to say is that laughter is a very powerful thing @CAPS1 by making someone laugh, you can change their mood, their day or in some cases maybe change their whole life. People say that laughter is very contagous. I beleive that is true. Take comedians for example, they can take any situation and make a whole room burst with laughter. My favorite one is when this one comedian said "@CAPS2 @CAPS3 shivering in the cold, we will bring him silver and gold", like the song. He then said " @CAPS4 don't they @CAPS1 bring him some blankets, I meen come on, the poor kid is going to die of hypothermia but at least he will be rich when he does". I wrote this paper to show how powerful laughter is in the world. I beleive that everyone should laugh at least once a day to make the world a brighter place.   I conclude with this " A smile can light up a room but laughter can change the world into a happier place". Nobody should go through life without laughter. " A life without laughter is a life not spent".

A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago @CAPS4 I meet my friend @CAPS1. I meet her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's @CAPS4, @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, "@CAPS3 watch where your going!" @CAPS4 we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, "@CAPS5 its @CAPS6, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk." We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved band. @CAPS1 and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS4 you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS1 until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way.

 Laughter is a very important part of life, for many different reasons. Some @MONTH1 say that its vital to survive, one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. This is a statement I myself believe, and have concluded from the actions and outcomes in my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone either depressed or happy. It is true when someone says there is a difference when someone is laughing at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laugh with me, its an amazing, self esteem raising emotion. This laughter brings friends closer, and causes us to trust each other more. One time I thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful. One scorching @DATE1 day my friends and I decided to venture to the mall, being we lived in apartments and lacked the money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a splendid idea. When we reached the mall we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors swung open, as if to greet us. All of us are very introverted so shopping around in an over crowded mall wasn't our cup of tea. Not knowing what to @CAPS1 we sat on a bench and did what we call people watching. Their was this girl, I will always remember her; @CAPS4 was one of those girls you peer at just for a minute and you know @CAPS4 was rich. A sort of stuck up girl, a walk where @CAPS4 means to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleach blond hair.  The girl passed by us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were not even remotely good enough to be in her presence. Quite a bit angry I stood up after @CAPS4 strolled past and mocked her strut. My friends found this hysterical. Roars of laughter leaped from their mouths. The pressy girl stopped proceeding forward and then started approaching us. @CAPS4 grimaces at us all snobby-like and says, "@CAPS1 you guys like have a problem or something?" @CAPS2 covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Fortunately my best friend stepped in and said, "@CAPS3, we think your dress is very pretty." @CAPS4 believed us, then walked off, in a rather less snobby sort of way.  Through this weird and interesting experience my friends and I learned a lot. One, people can hear you talking crap about them from a mile away. Two, laughter can bring friends together, but can also have some consequences. I @CAPS1 not know for sure if @CAPS4 did hear or see us mocking her. But I knew inside I felt a little bad. Sure laughing at her in the time felt right, amusing. Looking back on it, I feel awful. I have been in that same situation but on the receiving end. It is not pleasant having people talking crap about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughing is very vital to life but needs to be appropriate.

DAIRY @CAPS1 boyfriend and I spend a lot of time hanging out together,@CAPS2 two days ago @PERSON3 and I had just gotten into an argument . his mom had just finished making food.he wanted me to try it and see if i liked it. but before I ate any @CAPS3 him if he would eat some of it with me."maybe just a little bit"he had said getting up to grab a fork.Ithought he was going to eat it with me but it turned out that he just sat next to me talking to @PERSON2 @CAPS2 the fight he had just been in. I really didn't mind the fact that he wasn't eating with me. Icontinued eating, I separated the food by colors to make a face on my plate. it turned out looking pretty great, he looks over and says"whats that supposed to be?" with a smirk on his face"its a face!... see the carrots are the nose the shrimp are the eyes the greens and , noodles form the mouth and hair" I look up with a smile "wanna take a picture of my face on the plate ?" I say "nope"he answers "@CAPS4" I answer backI mix up all the things again and continue eating my food when I'm done I get up , put the plate in the sink go back to the table and sit down. @PERSON3 gets up goes outside brings more wood for the fire place and starts lighting it. I go up ask him if hes mad he says yes now I'm sad. I say I'm sorry we talked it over and it turned out that he was mad because I didn't let him take a picture of my food. after five minutes were happy again @PERSON1 suggests that we go to @CAPS5 we all agreed. when we got their we all ordered our food and waited."lets to the wrestling mat!?"we all said at the exact time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 stayed waiting for the order while @PERSON3 and I when to go play in the little kid toys. we were fighting our way in to the wrestling mat when we noticed that all the little kids were staring at us like they had never see older kids play . we continued our little game of kicking, punching, slapping and scratching each other. i decided that i need a time out so I sat up and took long breaths.out oh the onwear I hear this weird noise I look over and asked him if he had farted he looked at me with a cheese smile and after five second he repiles yes. and continued farting but the room seemed quiet too quite we looked a round to see that all the littlte biys and girls heard him too! their were to little girls standing at the entrance a little boy a few feet away from @PERSON3 and two other little kids by the slide.I guess they were shocked i started laughing to tears, ran out of the play room to go tell @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 what had just happen they too thought that it was hilarious.

                                @CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is a powerful tool when you know how to use it. It has the ability to inspire, when in doubt. Lift heavy spirts to new heights, and it can also create great devotion, to a person, thing or cause. So what has laughter done for you and I? Well it has done lots for me, a good example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION2.  At @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3 I had everything going for me. I had good grades, teachers, but most of all a group of friends that I could share many laughs with. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION3 my friends either moved or dispersed into other groups. It was horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things pretty tough. Then came the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Since I wasn't really envoled in the program I didn't have any friends, save vanecek. Then an opportunity it join the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 arose, I took it. Every afternoon for one hour we had practice, which in turn created a strong bond between the @ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting we would laugh it up and relax, making it a fun enviroment to shoot. The @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The @ORGANIZATION2, which my battalion as a part of, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family. My family, seeing how I was nervous, took me aside the night before the shoot-out. We played cards, talked and cracked jokes, it was the one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous just relaxed. Out of twenty four man teams we took third, not bad for a new famliy. Since then the @ORGANIZATION4 has taken first, four times in a row. Those victories I have to give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter in a way has inspired me to devote myself to a family, and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS4 @CAPS1 are you part of?

 Seeing one of @CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. Its was the @DATE1 after @CAPS15 @NUM1 grade year of school. I was having @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and @CAPS15 neighbor @PERSON1 stay the night at @CAPS15 house. @CAPS25 ever we got bored we usually went around @CAPS15 neighborhood "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3" some houses to have some fun. "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3" is @CAPS25 @CAPS21 quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then @CAPS23 run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great @DATE1 day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.@CAPS25 it came to night fall we were all in @CAPS15 room playing @CAPS7 @NUM2.  "I'm bored bro," @PERSON2 said to the other three of us.  "@CAPS8 then, think of something to @CAPS19,"@CAPS9 replied  "I can't think of anything," @PERSON1 stated with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something to @CAPS19 to entertain the four of us. "I got it!" I said with a confident smirk ,"lets go @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!" " I down for that ,"@PERSON2 said "@CAPS13 me too ,"@CAPS9 and @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2. As we were walking out @CAPS15 front door @CAPS15 mom shouted ,"where are @CAPS21 boys going?" @CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say ,"uh, we are going on a walk ,"I replied hesitantly.  "@CAPS16 be safe," @CAPS15 mom said as I walked out of the door. We @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I have thought of yet.  "@CAPS18 this is what needs to happen, I'm going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 the first house, @PERSON2 @CAPS21 get the next one, @PERSON1 @CAPS21 get the house at the corner and @PERSON3 will run around the corner to get the last house.   "@CAPS19 @CAPS21 think that will work?" @PERSON1 asked.  "@CAPS20 yes it will work!" I said,"@CAPS21 @CAPS18 ready?"   "I guess so ," @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw @PERSON2 slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @PERSON1 ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.  "@CAPS9 get the last house!" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 was running to did not have their porch light on. @CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,"should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?"  "@CAPS23 run @CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear @CAPS21 smack their screen door with your face!" @CAPS25 we got back to @CAPS15 house everyone was laughing. @CAPS9 @CAPS23 made our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time one of your friends ask @CAPS21 to "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28" a house think about if the porch lights are on.

 "@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my purse is." I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS7. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS8 to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't.

                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear.

                     Laughter Laughter has always played a significant role in the relationships of @CAPS2 life. Being able to laugh with someone creates a bond with that person.Through laughter, I was able to become friends with a person that I can call to this day @CAPS2 best friend. I met the person that would later on become @CAPS2 best friend through one of @CAPS2 friends. A few friends of mine and I were hanging out and @CAPS2 friend, @PERSON1, said, " @CAPS1 know @PERSON2, @CAPS1 should talk to a good friend of mine."I didn'@CAPS4 oppose to the idea because from what @PERSON1 told me about her, it seemed like it would be very easy for me to get along with her. About ten minutes later, I looked down at @CAPS2 cell phone and noticed that I had a text message from a number that I did not know. I asked who the person was and waited for a response. Two minutes pass by and I get a message that says, "@CAPS2 name is @ORGANIZATION2. I am the girl the curly-headed kid sitting next to @CAPS1 told @CAPS1 about." Once I read this I started just about busted up into a fit of laughter. Never would I have thought a girl I had never spoken to would be brave enough,or sarcastic enough, to say something like that as the first thing they would say to me. For the next few hours, we kept exchanging sarcastic remarks and jokes and the laughs just kept on coming. @ORGANIZATION2 is the type of person that can make anyone laugh. This is what I love about her; @CAPS3 possesses a talent of making anyone laugh no matter where they are, what kind of mood they are in, or what they are doing. We have walked around for hours and we have spent a majority of that time having to stop and catch our breath because we had been laughing so hard. Our ability to laugh with each other has helped us through difficult times in our lives. @ORGANIZATION2's mom passed away a few years ago and this sent her into a depressive state. @CAPS3 rarely felt any happiness until we would talk. Our ability to start laughing at one another helped her throughout this time. I recently received a @CAPS4.B.I. or @ORGANIZATION1. I felt numb to the world. Nothing felt the way that it once felt. Luckily for me, @ORGANIZATION2 was able to come in and do what I had done for her; @CAPS3 was able to make me laugh and feel normal again. Having the ability to laugh with @ORGANIZATION2 has definitely made our friendship stronger than it would have been had we not been able to laugh together. Being able to laugh doesn'@CAPS4 just effect that one moment in time, nor does it just impact one person. Having laughter means so much more than that. Being able to laugh creates bonds that are simply not possible without laughter. I have felt what laughter can do to a relationship and I can say that it most definitely feels good.

 "@CAPS1!" @CAPS2 society today loves laughter. From comical shows to hilarious friends, people have fun convulsing with glee. Not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. Everyone that texts @MONTH1 use "@CAPS3" or "haha" to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having, "a smile that burst."  I couldn't wait. I was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. Because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping @CAPS4. Jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. After the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. Jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  We headed into the crisp air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. The walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  When we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. Eventually, @CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. At last, the astonishing sunrise happened. It was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. I peered over the edge and saw a little path. With a bunch of convincing, I got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  The first part of the path was simple. As we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. A couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So on we went. "@CAPS6 no!" @CAPS7 yelled. We turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. She had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. Suddenly, @PERSON1 tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @PERSON2 forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. While flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if I didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. While she was in the bush, she grabbed @PERSON2's shoe. The hard part was getting @PERSON1 out.  The first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. Finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. @PERSON1 was super embarrassed. After all of that, we headed down the hill. We still had giggles while trotting down the trail. As we went, we saw animal tracks. We then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. A couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. With out it, we could have been very grumpy. Also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important. When writing this paper to the @ORGANIZATION1's in @LOCATION1, I told my friends about the adventure we went on and the predicament we got ourselves into. They laughed hysterically, since they knew the girls. Laugh often to be happy.

 "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."  @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those great times last @DATE1 and all the ones to come. Some people think were weird but if you knew us you would understand. Sometimes people say, "I'm going to die laughing." @CAPS2 i know I am because of @PERSON1, she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together i could there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times.  First of all, this friendship started the @DATE1, and now we are in sophomore @DATE1 of high school. We've been friends for one @DATE1 and eleven months and six days. We are the best of best of friends.  So last @DATE1 when we were learning the cheers for football season, all most every-time we got done with a cheer, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I would say, "@CAPS3-in @CAPS4." That was our saying, and we always did it @DATE1 and after the football or basketball games. We called it our @CAPS3-in @CAPS4 style or for short our slogan. We would be having a blast and laughing for hours.  "@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn," In @DATE2 we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION1, every-time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. Oh @CAPS1 goodness we laughed and we had a blast. After the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 turns, there was another motion we called the monkey and we would act like monkeys. It was so much fun we laughed. We also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really bad.That was one of many car rides that was amazing.  On the other hand, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I, cheer together, we have sleepovers, @CAPS2 i should say that we do everything together. She is @CAPS1 cheer sister and will always be, also she is @CAPS1 best friend.I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1 @PERSON1.  In addition, to the we do everything together. When @PERSON1 is over at @CAPS1 house I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so i went and made all of that and @PERSON1 loved it so now i have to make sure i have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the becomes of the sandwich habit.b we laugh about it all the time.  Finally, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever, because i don't know what i would do with out @CAPS1 sister. I would not be the person who I am today with out her she and everything to me we laugh even when we want to cry she is everthing to me. You could say we have a perfect freindship of all time. @CAPS1 bestfriend is @CAPS1 sister I love you @PERSON1, thanks for alays having @CAPS1 back.

 It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy.

 It was one of those days where I just sat around all day doing nothing, but play @PERSON2, text, and laugh at myself. It was one of those days where no one bothered me; no one even really talked to me; no one told me to do chores. By dinner time someone decided to call me up stairs to eat, but let me tell you, it wasn't anything like pizza. Although I'd rather eat it than get a lecture on not being thankful. My brother came home for the first time in ever, ate with us, then decided to leave again. But this time I asked to come with; I'm so tired of beating @PERSON2. He said no, of coarse. I made my daddy change his mind for him, of coarse. I don't see why he wouldn't let me come in the first place. He was going to hang out with the guys I grew up with, my friends, not his. Anyways. I got ready then we hit the road. There him and I were, laughing about dinner and what kind of music my mom listens to, on our way to pick up my friends. These guys are great! All we do is crack jokes about each other and crack up. But let's get down to business. I didn't tell you this, but it's @DATE1 time, around The @CAPS1 of @DATE2. Fireworks are for sale and we're creating "bombs" out of them. Or they are. Since I'm a girl, I guess I'm not allowed, or something lame like that. But there is this girl my brother likes and I guess he wants to impress, excuse me "impress" her by showing up at her house so she can see these "master pieces" they've made. That just makes me feel bad for him, but honestly just made me laugh. Maybe she'll be impressed. Key word: maybe. Although, no, it won't. Because to this day they are still only friends.  So about these bombs. Complete duds. We tried, well I just watched, over and over again to make 'em work, but they wouldn't do a thing. Eventually my friend @CAPS2 put a whole bunch of @CAPS3 @CAPS4's into my favorite stuffed animal. It just made a bunch of sparkly colors and loud noises, but it was pretty fun to watch. We got in on video too, it was a total good laugh for everyone. After my brother said goodbye to his "girl," we decided to head home. The thing is, we had so many fireworks left! We know this kid @PERSON3 who lives somewhere on the way home. So we decided to go by his house, have @CAPS2 get out of the truck, light the firework on his porch, have him jump in the tail of the trunk, then drive off as fast as we could. The first time we did it we couldn't stop laughing. They didn't come out of their house, so we did it again. They still didn't come out. We did it about one more time, by then all the neighbors were out. They were all so confused. That just made us laugh even more. It was so great we wanted to keep doing it, but to someone else this time. We know this girl @PERSON1 who lives near all of us. We thought, why not? It's not gonna hurt to stop there real quick and have some fun with her too. Apparently she thought different. Way different, actually she thought it was the rudest thing ever. We were just joking around, gettin' a laugh out of all our fun. We weren't being rude, she's our friend. Long story short, her mom got mad too and chased us down in her car. She never caught us, but she got our license plate number. The next day, on The @CAPS1 of @DATE2, she called the police. They didn't think it was a big deal, but they still showed up at my house and talked to my parents about what went down. I was at my boyfriend's so lucky me I only had to talk to my mom on the phone about it. She realized we were just having fun and actually laughed about it too. That @CAPS1 of @DATE2 @CAPS8 was great. It was one of those nights where you laughed the whole time and wouldn't change a thing even if you got in trouble with the law for it. Something I will definitely never do again, but I'm so glad I have this hilarious memory to reminisce on for the rest of my life.

                                        A day with the family  One day my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and i had gone out to eat at @ORGANIZATION2 for breakfast. They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS2 much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS1 where my cousin @PERSON1 farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS2 many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS2 hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS2 bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom "I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have".  Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us @CAPS2 we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS2 we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out "wicked witch of the west"! He frowns at me and says, "@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out." @CAPS2 i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS2 confused. My cousins shouts out "poop"! My brother yells "@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop"! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS2 dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME1.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good.

 Laughter is important, we all know that. It makes life easier, happier and even helps you live longer. It's also very important to relationships. When talking about preference in significant others it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, this is why. this story is , however, not about dating. It is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next.  I had known @PERSON1 for a while for a few months at this point, I had met him on the bus. He was pale, skinny, loud, and he always had something funny and offensive to say. He was a shut in. Before I met @PERSON1 I could dish it out but I couldn't take it. I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to befriending him, we were fighting about something so insignificant that I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Although I do remember what he said. He said that I was a "hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun jokes at other peoples expense but would get up in someones face if they tried one at me." this made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right but because it made me realise that @PERSON1 was actually a pretty good guy whose only real problem was that he didn't know when to shut up. Throughout the whole time I have known @PERSON1 he has never stopped smiling. He laughs off everything from stepping in dog crap to his fathers drug addiction he can dull the pain of any blow with laughter. @PERSON1 is my constant reminder to never stof laughing.

Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have been there, I know @CAPS4 have. We all have. @CAPS4 have been that kid that just did not feel like helping your nagging parent out. Especially when your dad had been in a huge motorcycle wreck and @CAPS4 had been waiting on him hand and foot the entire visit there.@CAPS10 had gone through a couple of surgeries and was put on a lot of medications for @CAPS2. I had noticed @CAPS10 was not really himself on all these pills. His abnormality was taking a toll on the family. Through all these stressful times, we were also worried about @CAPS6 stepmother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also stress of having @CAPS6 fathers business being the main income, and him not being able to work. @CAPS6 father felt helpless, his leg was to weak for him to be doing anything.@CAPS10 would micromanage everything, and tell @CAPS4 were doing things all wrong. The was starting to cause a lot of tension within the house.  Today was the day. Isabelle (@CAPS6 little sister) and I were left alone with @CAPS6 with dad for the first time.I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in @CAPS6 room. Father asked asked if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with full hands I said "@CAPS5, but I will when I'm done." @CAPS6 father took that as disrespect, and hobbled over to me with his crutches. @CAPS10 was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back i headed to @CAPS6 room.The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to @CAPS6 room. That's when it happened. @CAPS6 father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting @CAPS6 knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Slamming the door luckily I had the phone and I called @CAPS6 grandmother. I told her on a voice mail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted @CAPS6 sister and I telling us it would be okay. @CAPS6 grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then @CAPS6 dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @CAPS10 used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then @CAPS10 started making fun, and jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreeing @CAPS6 dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after @CAPS10 told some jokes, @CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why @CAPS10 was sorry. I liked that which made the rest of the day quite a joy.  " @CAPS7 made laughter to be a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 medicine, @NUM1 minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of @CAPS2 @CAPS3." @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a @DATE1 service talked about this. Laughter can truly mend a broken heart. The @CAPS2 that @CAPS6 sister an I went through that day was all over after the laughter @CAPS6 father gave us. "Laughter can save us." @CAPS10 also stated. After this day I believe with a little humor @CAPS6 father an I's relationship can get through anything. I would never let one mistake control a life time bond. Laughter will always be in our hearts.

Laughter play's an important role in relationships, @CAPS1 also supports enjoyment and can be a persuit of happinees. Whenever i am laughing its either because i am really enjoying myself or im just having a great time.Many people don't have a very good sense of humor and dont laugh at thing's that are funny, whenever i watch a funny movie's that i like i sit down and wait for the very funny parts, but dont get me wrong, remember not to laugh to hard because you might wet youre pants by accident or who knows if you laugh hard enought you might even pull a "whotammy "and trust me that does not look pritty and then you will be embarresed infront of everybody. My favorite comedian is adam sandler because he is very funny and has a good sense of humor, he knows how to keep a person laughting and interested in his comedy shows and movies.when he made the big daddy movie @CAPS1 was pritty good not to funny but @CAPS1 was good.My secound favorite comedian is @PERSON1 because he is funnyer that adam sandler by a lil bit but not quit as good though he also stars on a tv show called wild'n out that show really makes me almost cough out my lungs, especially when they bust out with youre mama jokes @CAPS1 keeps you laughting and keeps the blood pumping thru youre body.so we all pritty much under stand what laughing is but most people dont really seem to laugh at things that are funny i cant quit undersatnd @CAPS1 but my guess is tha t they dont have a good sene of humor but some people seem to lautgh at thing that dont even make sense i quit dont undestand that either but i guess its better to laugh than to not laugh at all.

 Laughter is the cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebodies pain. Laughter can mend a friendship to make two strangers become the best of friends. A person can ask anybody on the street of how much laughter is important in life and they would say that laughter is very important. It's like love, everyone needs a little of it in their life and like laughter, it helps a person grow and become an adult. A person can use laughter to help them with anything like getting a job, or trying to get the girl, or just having a good time and making new friends. It's one of the main elements of life that make a person how they are and what they do. In the @DATE1 I was introduced to a girl named @DATE3, by my cousin @PERSON1. She started talking to me and I was shy because she was a girl and I wasn't used to talking to girls. I cracked a joke and that made her and I laugh together and that was the first icebreaker to making a new friend. The days went by and we were text messaging each other each day over the phone, making jokes about how our day was and making jokes about each other. Eventually we started talking to each other over the phone. Teens these days usually don't use the phone to call people and that makes emotions hard to understand because talking over text hides emotions from one another. @DATE3 called me and we would talk to each other until late in the @TIME1, to where we would both fall asleep and leave the phone on, and again we would always be making jokes about everything. Making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school. Making her happy was what I needed to do, and one of the ways to make her happy was to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentlemen because I was raised that way.  @DATE2 formal was coming near and I was in need of a date. @DATE3 was my best option for a date since I was getting close to her and I was starting to get attached to her. When I had the chance I asked her to be my date for the @DATE2 formal which would be one of the most special nights of my freshmen year. The day of the formal came and we danced the @TIME1 away and of course I had to make a few jokes about other things which made everyone laugh and have a good time. Near the end of the dance I asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. She said I was funny, and nice, and cute which was good. We had a fun time because good humor and fun kept the @TIME1 alive. The next @DATE2 formal, the same thing happened with a different girl except that laughter was an important key and that made the @TIME1 so much fun. That @TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life that I had ever had, because we were laughing and having the best @TIME1 ever. Laughter is an important key in my life. I would have never gotten the girl or have had the best @TIME1 of my life if laughter was never involved. Laughter makes everything better and I use it in my everyday life because everybody needs to have a good laugh if they are in a bad mood. Without laughter my life would be dull and have no color that would make me who I am today. It's one of the many keys of life that everyone needs to be happy, and without it you would be less happy then you are right now. A small child could live his whole childhood without laughter or any other important element in his life and he could end up being a mean and cruel person who does not understand good values and humor. Everybody needs personality and color in their life and with out it everything id grey. Life is like a coloring book and without someone or something to color them in with, it's just useless.

 I have had many great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground. @CAPS1 campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME1. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food.  The next @TIME2 on the way out we saw a sign that read "caution racoon problem." @CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1. Once in @LOCATION1 we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1. While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny. A young blond woman came out to help us and she wasn't the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly "dumb blonde", while the woman was standing right there. She didnt say a word and my gandpa drove off with me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened. The next @TIME1 we stayed at a diiferent campground with no racoons. Still the @TIME1 was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmellows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmellow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmellow before he even got one that he could eat. And everytime he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt. The best part was theat my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent that @TIME1 we were so tired everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2. Thats when everything went silent and we couldnt last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always keep me laughing and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with. Keep laughing and have a fun in all you do.

 "Laughter" I believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things between you and a loved one get fuzzy making them laugh will always help break the ice. When I get angry with my boyfriend he knows that in order for me to be happy he must make me smile/laugh. That is exactly what he does. The very first time he made me angry he didn't know what to do. It was @DATE1 @CAPS1 and I had just started dating. I remember he asked me if I was hungry and I said "no I'm not hungry," so he continued to ask. Since we had only been dating for a short period of time he really didn't know much about me, so he didn't know that I am a type of girl that gets annoyed easily and I have a really low temper. He continued to ask me if I was hungry, thirsty, bored, or tired but he didn't realize that at this point I was really annoyed; an hour and a half passed by and he was still asking! I was going crazy I didn't want to tell him how I felt because I knew I was going to make him feel bad, but I thought to myself and said "no he has to know because its going to be worst if later on in the relationship he has to find out what I like and don't like on his own rather that me telling him. I went on and told him every single little detail about me good and bad, at first he just listened but towards the end he exploded and told me that why wasn't I just straight up with him from the beginning. That made me really upset, I was trying to be honest with him before anything worse happened but i guess not. I stayed quiet for the longest time and he kept asking me "what's wrong," "tell me what I did wrong" so I told him that it really made me upset how he flipped out on me for no reason really all I was trying to do was save us from a larger argument, he looked at me and told me that I did do something wrong! He said that we had already been together for two months and it took me that long to show him my true colors I kind of understood where he was coming from but at the same time I didn't agree because by that point he should have already known. I mean it doesn't take that long to know a person especially if its your girlfriend. In the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other. He busted out saying "ouch charlie you bit me" in a @CAPS2 accent that just made me loose it I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about thee over whelming discussion we had. The point being here is that laughter is the tool to breaking the ice when things get tough and it doesn't necessarily have to be a loved one it can even be a complete stranger, if the person is shy making them laugh will help construct a great friendship with them. You can make anybody's day go great with just a little grin that you put on their face a simple "hello" or "hey" can even make them smile. I believe that a person that smiles often lives longer. This @MONTH1 not be true but in my little world it is. I am all about smiling, all about making people laugh. Honestly I hate seeing people walk around with angry faces like if they have no friends when all they really want is someone to make them smile-and that would be me! In conclusion, if it wasn't for laughter what relationship would still be standing at this point? None, because if your always arguing and always wining and never laughing then how do you expect your relationship to last? Like I said "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."

Angelina @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a year ago, some time in the @DATE2, I was at my best friend @PERSON1's house for a sleepover after her @CAPS3 party. We were exhausted from swimming at her @CAPS4's pool and taking her dog for a walk, not to mention the partying, and we would have been asleep if it weren't for the family-sized bag of @CAPS5 and six pack of @ORGANIZATION1 we'd consumed not an hour before. At around three in the @TIME1, our childish minds searching for something to do, we decided it was a good idea to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish in hopes of them glowing in the dark when held to the black light on her windowsill. I was the first one daring enough to touch my tongue to the brush, and boy did it hurt! The acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds. The next day was @DATE1 and, after hanging out at @LOCATION1's house for the afternoon, we came to my house for another sleepover, which is what we did and sometimes still do every time we are together. That night, this time around two in the @TIME1, we grew hungry again and came downstairs to get a snack before retreating back to my room and @PERSON1 playing on my computer while I used her phone to text my former crush. @PERSON1 got jars or ice water, I still don't know why she uses jars instead of cups, interrupted my spinning around the kitchen floor with my new socks, and we had a random instantaneous ice chugging contest. After ten seconds of silence, I glanced over my jar at @LOCATION1, who wasn't even half done with her water. There, on her chin, was a speck, a dot, a glob, of blue nail polish. I attempted a gasp to give me enough air to start laughing at her, but instead of air coming into my windpipe, and ice cube made its way in. Choking, laughing, falling on the floor, laughing, nail polish-picking, and more laughing, we stood in the middle of the kitchen with nothing to actually laugh at that was that funny. @PERSON1 dropped her jar and it shattered on the floor, sending shards of glass and water across the kitchen, but that's okay. We were having fun, and, guess what, we fell asleep on the kitchen floor not ten minutes later. I suppose we were more tired then we thought. We did clean up the glass though. Some people say laughing is the best medicine a doctor can use, that it can cure any disease, that it can brighten anyone's day. Dentist's apprentices use laughing gas that makes people loopy and smile a lot when they do operations on your teeth, and it doesn't hurt as much, until the day after, but that's because you just had a tooth pulled. Today @PERSON1 and I are still best friends. Sure, we get in fights, but they end within a week or two. The longest fight we were ever in lasted a month and a half, and it was a misunderstood rumor another friend of mine had started, and ended by us both laughing @CAPS2 how stupid whatever happened really was. Within the five or six years of @PERSON1 and I being friends, we realized laughing is healthy and good for you, both physically and emotionally to relieve stress, so every time we see each other we laugh as much as possible. Inside jokes popping up from something said that was totally unrelated, a funny-looking person walking down the side of the road, or just our own minds saying its time to be happy again, it all triggers laughter. Sometimes it hurts, but we cant help laughing harder, because its fun.

Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends @PERSON2 I decided @CAPS5 would be fun to go out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods @PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 hide @PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that @CAPS5 was pouring down rain @PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 after we had our little meeting @PERSON2 got everything situated @PERSON2 dealt with, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 went of @PERSON2 hid while me @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @PERSON2 count. After we counted to about @NUM2 we hear screaming @PERSON2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON2 maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. I was curious @CAPS3 I cracked the car door open @CAPS3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 rite behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked as if @CAPS4 was about to cry @PERSON2 @PERSON2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS4 kept slipping @PERSON2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS4 finally made @CAPS5 back @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON2 screaming from, @CAPS3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION1 jumps out in front of me @PERSON2 says "right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!" @CAPS3 I walked over to where @CAPS4 pointed @PERSON2 looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON2 grabs me from the back @PERSON2 screams. I turn around @PERSON2 look at her thinking "what the heck is wrong with you people!". @CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON2 ask her "whats wrong" @CAPS4 asks me, "why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!" @CAPS5 was dark @PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON2 as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON2 by the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON2 yells "@CAPS6! Its moving, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's moving @CAPS7!" @CAPS3 as I approach the girls @PERSON2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 points @CAPS5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS5 to move again @CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @CAPS5 with the flash light @PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 ask her "@CAPS3 @PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?" @CAPS4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, "take a look at @CAPS5 for yourself" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 saw @CAPS5.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that @CAPS4 say @CAPS5 I told @PERSON2 what @CAPS5 was @PERSON1 her @PERSON2 I started cracking up laughing about @PERSON1 @PERSON2 her "hideous monster". Once I got my laughs out on @PERSON2, we all went back to the car where @PERSON3 was waiting @PERSON2 we left. Ever since that night @PERSON2, @PERSON2 @PERSON2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Every time we think about @CAPS5 we all start laughing @PERSON2 making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag.
<START>

 For me laughter makes the world go round. It is much needed to keep the world light and filled with a seance of happiness. You will hardly come across me with out a big old smile plastered across my face. There is so many stores to choose from but @TIME1 one will be the most fun to tell i think. It still makes me giggle just thinking about that @TIME1. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, @PERSON1, down to @LOCATION1 for the forth of @DATE1. They have a big forth of @DATE1 walk and i was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom. We wear staying with good friends of his mom @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. There house was stunningly amazing, beaut full wood floors, big open living room that combined with the kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings, and a big stunning window that framed crisp @CAPS3. @CAPS4. Even with the house being so great my favorite part wear the rail rode tracks. Not more than a quarter of a mile through a little trail surrounded with woods wear two sets of tracks stretching out in both directions @CAPS5 far @CAPS5 the eye could see. My favorite part of the hole trip wear those tracks. It was the second @TIME1 of our stay in @LOCATION1 around @NUM1 o clock. @PERSON1 and i when for a walk in the refreshing @TIME1. We could hardly see and wear holding on tight to each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and giggling we finally stumbled out of the very well hidden trail entrance on to the tracks. Hand in hand we started to walk down the tracks just enjoying each others presents. In @CAPS4 the stars are the most stunning i have ever seen. I'm not sure why but the sky just seems to open up and look two times bigger than it relay is. @TIME1 @TIME1 was perfect for star gazing with out a cloud in sight. So we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars. There we cuddled together for a good @NUM2 minuets. Then @PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled expression then i followed his gaze to see what had aroused him. Far in the distance was a light. Slowly advancing t words use. Sure-a-nuff it was a train at @NUM1 o clock at @TIME1. Looking back at each other we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at @TIME1. @CAPS5 the train advanced we jumped up and off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot.  The train was going way slower than i was expecting. No more than @NUM4 to @NUM5 mile per hour. @PERSON1's eyes lit up with an idea and not thinking he said "We should jump it!"  @CAPS5 soon @CAPS5 the words left his mouth he regretted saying them. I thought it was a great idea! But he tried desperately to convince me not to do it. I headed twords the track telling him to live a little and lets have some fun. I had never jumped a train before but from the looks of it @TIME1 train was perfect to try it out on. There wear long flat bead cars with handy little latters on each one. I garbed for one and jumped on right before @PERSON1 could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We wear both smiling and having a great @TIME1 when we jumped off and met in a hug. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started coming our way. Freaking out, for sure thinking we would get in trouble i sprinted for the trail head with @PERSON1 close on my heals. I could not find the trail and the light was getting closer so we both jumped full speed straight in to a big bunch of bushes. There we stayed perfectly still tell the light passed us and the train began to rezoom its pace. I met @PERSON1's big fat smile and we both just rolled over laughing not being able to help ourselves. What wear the chances of going out for a simple walk and all @TIME1 happening. Still smiling hugely @PERSON1 leans over to me and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of my best nights ever. @TIME1 is just an example of how smiling and laughter was a big part of @PERSON1's and I in our relationship. Love, friends, and laughter is the reason life is worth living.

Being able to laugh, is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share it with is priceless. Family moments like that, are times no one can take away. They will be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and a very depressing place. Laughter is the main connection between family and friends.  My family and I decided that for our @DATE1 break we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION1. Not one of us @CAPS1 how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went.After two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to get across was huge. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up stairs to see where we were at. There it was @LOCATION2.  Once we got off the boat and through the crowed highways of @LOCATION2, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border. I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she @CAPS1 what she was doing, she replied "kinda". After hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were suppose to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS1 what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip we drove around laughing and telling my mom, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment.   Being able to laugh, is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull. Being with family and taking a negative situation, and turning it into the best vacation ever with laughter is truly priceless.Everybody needs to laugh in their life,because you only live once so make it worth while.

 Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is made that is like no other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this @LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings. Last @DATE2, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with @PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON1 came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a good time and enjoying the warm night. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that @DATE1. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, OR. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie-dyed shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were in the back with another girl in between them so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the @NUM2 @NUM3 hour car ride we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story telling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds which made for a very entertaining car ride.  At the tournament, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roomates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other.  Laughter is what brought @PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting @NUM4 girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making other laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter, and united together as one.

   Humor is a huge part of who i am,and i love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousins house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while but they would always cave and let us back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our life time. It all started out at my aunts birthday party. Usually she had it at some fancy restaurant but not this year, this year she decided just to have it at home to save some money. So we all show up for my aunts party my mom, my brothers, and me. First off we do all the regular birthday things, the meeting of family members, eating some food, and singing happy birthday. Basically in my eyes it was all the boring stuff. I mean come on there was a trampoline out in the back yard just waiting to be jumped on but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had ate. Finally everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an even that was about to transpire
<START>

It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON2 who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it.

 @CAPS1 is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in. Therefore @CAPS1 makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations. @CAPS1 is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each others company. My story is an example of laughter's connection between people and the strength of the bond @CAPS1 forms. Picture the scene: @CAPS1 was @DATE2 on the north side of @CAPS2. Hood below the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he could not continue further. Patiently standing beside him was his father, a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in @LOCATION1,and @LOCATION2. The boy was tired, he could not put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The @DATE1 sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. @CAPS1 was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting on foot in front of the other. He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often. The boy's father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going with no avail. He tried another tack, he began to tell the boy stories, perhaps in hope that @CAPS1 would take the boy's mind of the excruciating pain.And to the relief of all concerned, @CAPS1 proved effective. What was most interesting about the whole event is @CAPS1 wasn't the content of the stories that helped, @CAPS1 was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference.An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor I found the strength to keep going . @CAPS1 was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and leg which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead lightened considerably. The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left. The dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels were silenced. This was all due to someones thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone. I believe laughter to be the anesthetic of nature,the emotional element that keeps the world sane. @CAPS1 was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had a indomitable work ethic, was a great teacher, and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found hilarity at each others comment's. @CAPS1 forged a strong bond between us, one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day. Whenever I am morose he always manages to find away to bring a smile to my face and I found that I to had the same ability. To my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship,respect,and love. You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter. @CAPS1 is the drug that descends from the heavens. A drug that runs through the bloodstream of society. In the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also began to laugh. Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spread's throughout both of your faces, as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at. That connective force is a result of the power of laughter.

 Laughing, smirking, giggling, @CAPS1 chuckling; these all have to do with one subject, @CAPS1 that is, laughing. Laughter is everywhere, you hear it in libraries, parks, at home, behind your back, @CAPS1 it can be a great thing or a horrible thing in @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 even with family @CAPS1 friends. Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them, helped them out, cheered them up, or even, just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever. It was the start of a brand new @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 I had just moved from @LOCATION2. I was a seventh grader about to start at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wasn't a real big fan of hanging out with people , so i stayed to myself most of the weeks, eating lunch in the guidance center, trying to figure out where books where without talking to anybody. My schedule was good, I had choir, art, drama, you know all the stuff I like. Art @CAPS1 drama were a blast, but when it came to choir @CAPS1 singing, my social level went down. I love to sing, but never did it in front of people. Then one day, I was walking to choir @CAPS1 I tripped @CAPS1 fell, my papers falling with me. My @ORGANIZATION1 work was all over the hall, math at one end, science at the other. But, out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by @CAPS1 say I did a great job but something triggered her to come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework @CAPS1 picked up my schedule @CAPS1 saw that she too had choir this period. Her name was @PERSON1, she told me, @CAPS1 i told her my name, @CAPS1 we walked together. We sat next to each other @CAPS1 i sang with her ours voices in harmony. We talked in between periods, at lunch, on the bus ride home. We became great friends @CAPS1 the principal thought so too @CAPS1 he went ahead @CAPS1 gave us classes together. We were friends @CAPS1 we still are friends till this day. But the sad thing is is that she moved at the near end of eighth grade year. But she was the only friend I had for a little while @CAPS1 I always give her a call every now @CAPS1 then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing @CAPS1 talking about how we are doing @CAPS1 when we are going to see each other again. She has been my best friend for at least two years now @CAPS1 it all happened by a slip of a foot, that falling of papers, @CAPS1 one little laugh from an amazing person. Laughing has got me so far in life @CAPS1 at @ORGANIZATION1. Every now @CAPS1 then, when i see someone, all alone, wanting a friend, I go @CAPS1 talk to them, @CAPS1 even laugh with them. One little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen. Even if you don't think so, it does. Some say, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS1 I believe who ever said that because it happened to me.
<START>

  When it comes down to laughter, it can change a person's thinking or even the mood that @CAPS4 are in. Laughter can be the ending result, to a bad start to a day or to greater the relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I am feeling and it keeps me happy, I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and war, I feel like you should always keep your head held high and the smiles flowing. Although, when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade and keep your face with the sour look because it's funny! I think that laughter is one of the best medicines around and can fix most problems whenever you are feeling down.  @CAPS2 older sister brought into this world the most amazing little nieces, an aunt could ever have. When @CAPS4 were little babies I used make silly faces, dance to @PERSON1 and watch movies with them, but this isn't what brought us closer. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, in which made them happy too. One time, I was feeling really down and out, but I didn't want that to affect me, so I preceeded with @CAPS2 day and began to watch music videos, when "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3", by @ORGANIZATION1 came on. @CAPS4 went crazy!, @CAPS4 started jumping on the bed and twirling their @CAPS3 back and forth as if @CAPS4 were @ORGANIZATION1!, @CAPS4 really stole the show. I couldn't believe before @CAPS2 eyes that this one happening, and I bursted out with so much joy. I felt so much of their joy, that I had to get up and dance with them, we jumped, we twirled, and whipped our @CAPS3 several times before the song ended with us dizzy and out of breath. After we had our fun of the music video, @CAPS4 just kept dancing and in @CAPS2 head I'm, like "don't @CAPS4 ever get tired", but I was pretty sure that their laughter brought them continouis amazement. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless, @CAPS2 nieces really and are truly what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet, lets just called it bittersweet. I feel like @CAPS2 nieces knew that I would be sad so @CAPS4 would say "@CAPS5, what's wrong", @CAPS5 being @CAPS2 nickname because I am very short. @CAPS4 would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. Me and @CAPS2 neices relationship has grown to the highest extent and I know that whenever I'm with them, I will laugh. If someone once said that "laughter is the shortest distance between two people", then @CAPS4 are correct because I @MONTH1 be in a different country, state or any other area but whether we talk on the phone or actually see each other, I will laugh about all their crazy antics and the closer we become as one. 
<START>

 Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you @MONTH1 be one person who can be "stuck up" or a funny person who can really be "stuck up", but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are. When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. "@CAPS1 are blue, roses are red, your always in my head, i want you in my bed...." That's suppose to be a love poem. When your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend that went with me to the party her name is @PERSON1. It was gettting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything this was probably around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. See us for some reason do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just didn't want the night to end at all.  We al sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching "@CAPS2 A". Then out of random i started to laugh at @LOCATION1, and till this day I don't know why i was laughing at her. All of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe no more. So I got up walk my self to the bathroom, but i could still hear @CAPS3 laughter in the room which was still making me laugh.  Since that night @PERSON1 and I got a lot closer in our friendship. Laughter is a lot in life. It might make you feel like your dying sometimes, but that feeling is worth it.

 As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, "@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile.

 Just @CAPS1 walking through @ORGANIZATION2 in a banana costume with one of your best friends. We were trying to find the best costumes for a @CAPS2 party. When having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time. I can't even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest. @CAPS3 is just one example of the crazy things my friend @PERSON1 and I have done together. One thing is for certain, whenever we are together we are always laughing. Laughter reduces stress for both @PERSON1 and I. We were team members for the past six years. Both of us competed as gymnasts at @ORGANIZATION1. We worked out at the gym @DATE1 for four hours each day. That gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework. At @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I needed to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. @CAPS3 meant off the floor we needed laughter to reduce stress, as well as fear. In order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the @DATE2 sun.  Our friendship was strong because of all the laughing and fun times together. When either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off. Even when we are not together we often think of the memories we have shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps to reduce fear. It helps because if you were not having fun and laughing you would think about all of the bad things at could happen to you; then would you do have laughter involved it makes you want to do whatever it would be with your friend.  The laughter @PERSON1 and I shared always attached others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together. For example, @DATE2 we were at @LOCATION1's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, after awhile it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a big group of people, @PERSON1 and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It usually was a hide and go seek tagging game. Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were always laughing because we would trick everyone that was playing. It created a good and positive bond for the two of us even though there were more people. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS3 is how @PERSON1 and I became such amazing friends today. Without laughter, I do not think we would have been as close of friends if we didn't have laughter in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other. Laughter really connects the bond between friends and its helps both of you get through hard times.

 "Many other people believe that laughter is an important of any relationship." Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with those thoughts.  I came to @LOCATION1 about @DATE1, I did not speak @CAPS1 at all that time. I started going school. I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I go to school. Next day I walked in to school and I could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me.  "@CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1," the girl said. "@CAPS2, my name is @CAPS4. I'm from @LOCATION2. I don't really speak @CAPS1," I said to @PERSON1, then @PERSON1 started laughing so hard. "@CAPS6-@CAPS6 you have accent," @PERSON1 said, "it's really cute." I laughed back. @PERSON1 looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first @CAPS7 friend ever.  I always thought that making new friends are hard, but the laughter made it much easier than it used to be.

 Laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny. It is the best way to relax. Everyone says that hearing a baby laugh is great. Watching comedians doing their acts can cheer people up and have them start laughing. Laughter is the best way to relax and here is three reason for that. First, is that no one can stay angry at the person making them laugh. Second, is that when someone laughs everyone around that person start laughing. Third and last reason, is that no one can stay sadden when something funny is happening. What do you think when you hear a baby's laughter? I think that the baby is truly loved by its family. He or she is having a bast playing with someone in the family or themselves. They think that whatever you are doing is funny. A comedian's job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them. One way a comedian does an act is stand up comedy. That is when a comedian is on stage and does his or her act. Another way is a comedy. A comedy can be a @CAPS1.V. show, a play, or a movie. Comedies usually do not have a plot, but the point is to make you and anyone else start laughing. That is what I think about laughter. It helps anyone relax. Hearing a baby's laugh is great. Comedians love hear people laugh at or with them.

 @CAPS6 only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying on his chair with his hands over his eyes, a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to start off with. The guy's head rose up, the tears seemed to eat the self sturdiness of his normal self, and @CAPS2 spoke to the person who always sat to his left. " @CAPS1 just don't understand @PERSON2" the broken, voice cracked on words "I don't care that @CAPS1 play in cascade winds or that @CAPS1 get private lessons or that @CAPS1've gone to state honor band! This @MONTH1 sound like a terrible reason, but i just want to play first because i want to play first, and @CAPS1 never let us play first." @CAPS2 was right about one thing, @PERSON2 really never let us play first. I somehow understood where @CAPS3 was coming from; @CAPS4 my freshman year i had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so forth. I had never seen him be first chair on anything. And now on his senior year, a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair. In short @CAPS3's four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room. The feeling of all his hard work turned into mediocre in his face, with time, had broken him to tears.  @PERSON2 was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove @CAPS6. She had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and would be going to @LOCATION1 as an ambassador of music. Still something about her having first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe @CAPS6 was my sense of wanting superiority as well. @PERSON2 took in the words, leaned closer to say. " I understand that @CAPS1 want first" @CAPS10 with confident tones she said "but right now we need specific players in specific spots. I've played harder music and my skills are whats needed on first part. I understand what your feeling, ive been there before."  @CAPS6 struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior. How could she have felt what @CAPS2 was feeling? she'd been a prodigy child in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 from the start. I sided with @PERSON1 but @CAPS10 I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band. So i tried siding with @PERSON2 but @CAPS10 all i could think about was that this was @PERSON1's last year to shine as a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 french horn player.They kept going at eachother. Every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument. Minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile.  I had to think faster. @CAPS9 the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co-operation would be useless. More importantly I would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts. "@CAPS9 a man has no socks," I liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, " @CAPS10 so will...".And that's as far as i got. I thought @CAPS6 was brilliant, their faces said otherwise. So they called me crazy and giggled @CAPS10 they made fun of me and laughed. Thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say. @CAPS3 stopped crying, finally, and @PERSON2 got my message that @CAPS3 was a senior and didn't really have many more chances at playing first chair in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 band. They settled the fight with a simple deal; @CAPS3 would get fist chair as soon as we stopped competing. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 I've been the center of being made fun of. But as annoying as @CAPS6 gets sometimes its usually funny for everyone, including myself.  I cant even begin to imagine what band would be like @CAPS9 their enmity had risen to the no forgiveness zone. There had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so @CAPS7 @CAPS6 made @CAPS6 hard to breath right. Having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip eachother's faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other. Or opened their eyes to how long they're going to have to sit next to each other i they were to continue fighing. Either way, @CAPS6's definatley changed the way they feel about eachother; I haven't heard them complian about one another for a while. @CAPS3 is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and @PERSON2 for better or worse can't wait to see him play.

We're happy together @PERSON1 told me @CAPS2 we lay on his bed. I just smiled and I knew this was going to be a really good relationship. @CAPS5 always made me feel so great. @CAPS5 made me feel beautiful. Now don't say your too young to know what love is ,@CAPS1 I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel this wonderful about myself, made me feel perfect. When we are together it's fun. Most guys I have been with have not been @CAPS2 fun, @CAPS2 in our dates together, walking to the park too sit and talk, eating out to kiss in public. Before we were ever dating, We were best friends. We still are best friends. Everyone asked us @CAPS6 we were dating, The answer was always no we're best friend's, but I always wanted more. @CAPS5 has always made me laugh. I don't think we would have made such a strong couple @CAPS6 we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about @CAPS4 I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my @DATE1 class, and out of no where @PERSON1 grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buried his head in my neck and laughed and said "@CAPS3, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants" I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my @DATE1 class I was thinking to myself @CAPS4 could @CAPS5 just say that to me, @CAPS5 must of wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what @CAPS5 did and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 did it made me feel, well it made me feel like @CAPS5 really and truly cared about me. Wanting to help me out rather then embarrass me. I bet every other guy was laughing. Not @PERSON1... well after that happened we had a good laugh. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, @CAPS5 looked up and kissed me. I didn't know @CAPS6 that was a best friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I simply laughed. then @CAPS5 kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out the more people started to hate the fact that we were together. They would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about @PERSON1. Who knows what they were telling him. @CAPS7 some of my closest friends started to make rude comments toward me and @PERSON1. I know @CAPS5 didn't believe anything they were saying @CAPS1 @CAPS5 would laugh at everything people would toss our way. When @CAPS5 laughed I would always ask him whats so funny, @CAPS5 would say "@CAPS6 they rumors aren't true then laugh about them, that way people will know your not bother by them" I would have never thought about that. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would get a little peeved with all the stuff they were saying about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people were saying,. They stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought about being in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 let alone @ORGANIZATION1, and finding a guy that would understand what I'm going through. Let alone someone who is going through something almost @CAPS2 difficult. My brother went to prison @DATE1, and I don't think I could have be able to make it through @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 I did with @PERSON1. I cried almost everyday at @ORGANIZATION1 with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go see my brother I remember what @PERSON1 said, "@CAPS6 your happy the people around will be happy" so I always put on a smile to see @LOCATION1, @CAPS7 though I know this will be the hardest years of my life. Laughing does really help. @CAPS7 @CAPS6 nothing is funny just laugh. God put you on this @LOCATION2 for a reason, and @CAPS6 you haven't found that reason laugh until you do. @CAPS1 the people in your life mean the world to you, and @CAPS6 they're down bring them up. I love @PERSON1 for helping me understand that life's to short to go unhappy then to have had a life without laughter.

 Everyone loves to laugh; I don't think everyone understands the effect laughter can have on two people though. For example, there can be two complete strangers, who have never seen each other before in their life; as soon as they start laughing they could become good friends. You'll never know how close you can be with someone if you don't ever sit down and talk, laugh, and get to know them. You could go your whole life being at @CAPS4 with just a minute amount of friends but then there could be @NUM1 other classmates you've never talked to that could also become your friends, too. I'm sure just getting to know one another would make a difference in someones life because for me there has been many situations where laughing has made an impact on my relationship with someone; especially with my best friend, @PERSON1. When I first met my friend @PERSON1 we didn't know each other at all but laughing broke the ice. A simple laugh made us comfortable and everything was less awkward. As soon as we started laughing more and more, we couldn't stop; the rest was history. I went to elementary @CAPS4 with @PERSON1 for @NUM2 years and never talked to her but then when we got into @NUM3 grade we started hanging out with the same people and started talking more. By @NUM4 grade we began to hang out outside of @CAPS4 and talking, sharing secrets, and having sleep overs. But "breaking the ice" isn't the only impact laughing can have on a relationship. When I'm with @PERSON1, I know I can trust her and everything is fun. We always have conversations to talk and laugh about. You could say it made us closer. By the time @NUM5 grade came we were best friends, we had sleepovers every single weekend at one anothers house. When the @DATE1 before our @NUM6 grade year at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 came we were spending weeks at each others houses. There wasn't a day that went by that we weren't together, talking, or making plans over the @DATE1 to hang out. Now, we can be ourselves around each other; we can always have a good time. Making people closer is just a small part of the effects that just one laugh can do to two people. When I'm sad about something @PERSON1 makes everything better; also vise versa; I make her feel better, too. We always have each others back. I know we will always be there for each other; I'll always have a shoulder to cry on. We have become such close friends that when @PERSON1 was having problems at home she needed a place to live in order for her to not have to go to The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, so she moved in with me! It has been the most fun living with her. We thought we would start to argue and not be as close since we would always be together and probably get annoyed of each other but we haven't. @PERSON1 and I can hang out @NUM7 and always be together; it's like having another sister.  @PERSON1 and I are super close, and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 until we graduate. It's amazing to think us being best friends and tremendously close, living together, always being together, and being totally comfortable with each other on everything just started out with a simple laugh when we first started talking in the @NUM3 grade. This is why I believe that just laughing can make two strangers, that have never even spoken, can turn into being the closest of friends.

 One @DATE1 @TIME1 back in @DATE2 a couple of friends and I were beyond bored. Nothing seemed fun to do. @CAPS1 to a movie, @CAPS1 to get some food, not even call of @CAPS2 sounded entertaining. @LOCATION1 parents told us to go do something outside. Before leaving his house he slips into his pantry and grabs two hefty rolls of @CAPS11 wrap. "I think I have an idea" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 as we walk away from his house. I have no clue where we're walking to. @PERSON1 just keeps saying "follow me." We all follow in a pack down the street until we show up at @ORGANIZATION1.   Cold and confused, we sit in the parking lot of the @ORGANIZATION1 waiting for all cars to be gone. Once all the cars are gone @PERSON1 informs us on what we are doing here. He tells us of something he did with his cousins awhile back. You have three people on the roof of @ORGANIZATION1's @ORGANIZATION1 scoping out the road and you have four @CAPS4. "@CAPS4?" I question @PERSON1 with a dumb-found look on my face. "@CAPS5, @CAPS4" @CAPS6 @CAPS4 are the people who will be putting the @CAPS11 wrap across the street. The plan is when no cars are coming in the distance, we hop the fence and put @CAPS11 wrap across the street so cars drive through it and stop. "@CAPS7 sounds fun, but uh what happens when the @CAPS15 stops before the @CAPS11 wrap and takes it down?" @CAPS8 @CAPS9, looking down on the whole operation.  @PERSON1 laughs a little bit and @CAPS8 "@CAPS10 then it will be an inconvenience for the driver." @CAPS11 wrapping roadways sounded a lot for fun then black ops so we were all down.  Everyone gets in position. Mark, @PERSON4, @PERSON2 and myself are down by the roadway in a secluded area by some bushes. While @PERSON1, @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 are posted up on the roof giving us updates about the oncoming traffic. We get a call from @CAPS9 saying that it is clear for awhile. I hang up the phone, tell the guys and @DATE3 up from the ground. We all get over the fence in quick time and start a first layer of @CAPS11 wrap. I get another call. It's @CAPS14 saying that there are three cars are almost to our location. We drop the @CAPS11 wrap in the bush and get back over the fence. The @CAPS15 comes up close and it's a cop. Of course. We all just stay hidden down in the bushes while the cop takes our huge roll of wrap. We are only left with one more roll , which should before enough.  @CAPS9 calls again and @CAPS8 it's clear. We go out again and start to set up the prank. We wrap it around @NUM1 times and make it as tight as it possibly could be. Perfect.  "@CAPS15 incoming! Go! Go! Go!" yells mark while trying to get over the fence. We all make it over in time and go prone in the field. Laying there anxiously someone whispers "here it comes."  The @CAPS15 slams on it's breaks, and the driver gets out. He looks at @CAPS11 wrap in disgust and looks around for the kids responsible. @CAPS9 lets out a big "hahaha" from the roof that even we can hear perfectly. The guy walks up the fence looks around a bit more and mutters for foul words under his breath. He didn't even bother continuing through, he just got in his @CAPS15 and backed up."@CAPS16 my god dude that was hilarious!" I say with a wide grin on my @NUM2 @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 come dashing through the field with a scared expression on all of their faces."@CAPS18!" yells @CAPS19 scurried into different directions. Mark, @PERSON2 and I jolt over the fence and hide in the play structure for awhile. While the rest of the boys are booking it to a safe haven. We eventually all meet back up at @LOCATION1 house without getting "caught" by the authorities.  It's nights like @CAPS6 were laughter really plays a key role between a big group of friends like I have. The laughing and running makes us closer as a group. it brings us together.
<START>

 I agree when people say laughter is what mostly brings people together. In my opinion, @NUM1 of the time your talking to someone, laughter is needed. It is what brings the dullness out of a person, and makes the conversation interesting. Only when you are talking about something serious, you dont need to include laughter, but ill explain later. So I can easily tell a true story about laughter from my life. Right now i have a perfect group of friends. Sure there are times when they mess up and act like kids, but i feel like i need to forgive and remember that they are there when i need them. Anyways, i can remember the first time i met each one of them, and the one thing that started our friendship was a joke. I can't exactly remember which joke we shared, but i do remember that we all had the same taste in comedy. And once we saw that neither of us were serious and dull people, made us want to spend more time with eachother. That is why laughter builds a string between different people, and brings them closer together day by day. So as time passed, my friends and i were really drawn to eachother. What i mean is that, from time to time, we were happy to express our friendship through jokes. Sometimes the jokes are really stupid. Many of them have caused pain - physically, and have caused us to bring revenge on eachother. But that is just how, we stay close to eachother. Day by day, when we see something funny on the television, internet, or real life, we always show it to eachother, and know that after showing this prank, or whatever it is, the other person will find it very funny. It makes us feel closer, and know we all have a same taste in atleast one field. I can give one clear example of this: I was watching a comedy once, and the comedian was talking about his childhood, and a prank he once played on a strangers house. Right when i saw this video, i knew right away, my friends had to see this, because i knew from past experiences, that they enjoy these types of laughs. And i was right, as soon as they saw the show, they were amazed at how funny it was, and they were glad i shared it with them, we got closer than ever. I want to share one more example from my life, about laughter bringing two people closer. So after telling you that laughter gets me closer with friends, i also want to point out that laughter brings out a sence of outline when if you talk to girls - or boys, if you're a female. So i met this one girl, and everytime i talked to her, everytime i had to throw in a joke or a story that would make sence to our subject. After a while, she started joking around, and making stories too. She told me that she saw me as a different guy, comparing me to other people. She said that she meant i wasnt a boring type of person, and that it kept her wanting to keep talking to me. I always hoped not to be a dull person, and jokes made that not happen. Now, me and this girl are closer than ever, and the root that started this relationship was laughter. So as you see, laughter makes any relationship happy and open. Of course im talking about the relationships that are playful, i meant there are people out there that take everything serious, and can't take a joke. But i would really encourage you to take laughter in your life, if you already havent. Look in my life, i used laughter, and gained a lot of friends, of all sorts - just by joking around about something stupid. You don't have to say stupid things, but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you use laughter.
<START>

 These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS1 all started in the @DATE1 time when i was like @NUM1 years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS3 cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. @CAPS1 was fun having them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and my cousin @PERSON3 who lived right next to @CAPS3 would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS3 and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS1 was his. @CAPS3 and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON4 @CAPS1 was a @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS1 was just dirt but @CAPS1 was hard. One day when @CAPS1 was raining so hard @CAPS3 , @PERSON7 , @PERSON3 and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS1 was okay same with @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he could not cause @CAPS1 was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS3 straight to the shower . @CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON5 bros for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION1, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS1 was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS3 my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 would always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards back then every body had @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM2 grade @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON6 had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept over at @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 cause they would always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family.

 Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying "@CAPS1! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you @CAPS6!" @CAPS2 that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact it @CAPS6 only cause more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time where I met this guy named @PERSON1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend @CAPS3 and @CAPS8 would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had @CAPS3 tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. it was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god. He didn't have a wreath over his head with one of those @CAPS5 god skirts. Nope, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world.  Signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @PERSON2 (my friend) starts text messaging someone. I was a little curious so I asked in a friendly way who it was. @CAPS8 said it was @PERSON1 and my heart seemed to jump. "@CAPS6 you tell him I say hello?" "@CAPS7." @CAPS8 told him I said hello and he asked if I was really there and @PERSON2 said yes. That's when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day. We talked all the way back to @LOCATION1. A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little strange, but I don't judge), his life, his future, what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another of @CAPS3's friends said the same thing but @CAPS8 said he wasn't aloud to). I talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit. I told him about my life but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been bromidic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved to @LOCATION2. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning @PERSON2 came over to me and had a careful gaze. I asked what was wrong and then @CAPS8 asked if anything could ruin my day. I told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with @PERSON1 but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. @CAPS8 said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. @CAPS8 said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @PERSON2 out but I let it go just as @CAPS8 did when @CAPS8 said no to him and they stopped talking to each other. So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all.

Trust is a huge deal between friends. Friends agree on the same things, say an honest opinion about it, and don't lose the trust between a great friendship. You never know who can stay by you with a full amount of trust between you two.When you trust a friend you depend on them to keep things between each other. Just like my friends and I. We agreed on telling each other everything that has happened and not to lie about anything. We agreed on everything based on trust. Our friendship has always been great with not lying to each other. Telling each other how we feel about certain things. Then we put all our opinions together and come up with a solution that we all agree on. That's why you should depend each other like a team. When you break a trust between a friend, you probably won't get the same trust you had before. You don't really get told anything as much as you use to. An it's like you never should have lost the trust with a friend. You don't seem to be the same because you aren't trusted that much. You get told it was your fault lying or for any reason to be not trusted. Like this one time one of friends didn't tell me the whole truth of what she was doing behind my back. Till I found out what she was doing I lost most of my trust with her. She's not trusted as much she was before, but we are still friends.That's why having trust is a big deal in a friendship or any kind of relationship. You learn to trust each other in different ways, get to know each other more by having the trust between you and other person. You get a lot more attention when you have that trust with other people. You don't seem like you are left out on anything. You see that you can trust more people to when you get to know them. Who knows that you have trust for another person who isn't your best friend.So we all know that trust is a huge deal between two people or maybe even more. You need to work together for the trust. Have a good friendship or relationship to anybody as long as there is trust between you guys. My friends and I have learned a lot from trusting each other in different ways.

 One day @CAPS17 I was having trouble trying to cope with some very big changes in @CAPS13 life, I seeked the help of a friend. Usually @CAPS17 i'm having a bad day I @CAPS14 keep to myself. This was an occasion @CAPS17 I need someone else there to help @CAPS2. @CAPS17 I went @CAPS5 met with @CAPS13 friend she tried all she could to cheer @CAPS2 up but nothing was working. @CAPS6 she said "@CAPS1 hear a story?" @CAPS2 wanting to hear anything that would take @CAPS2 out of this slump I was curently in said "@CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS12 think it will help."@CAPS5 @CAPS6 she began.   "The other day @CAPS13 family @CAPS5 I went grocery shopping. We were gone for probably four hours. I stopped her right there @CAPS5 asked her how this was relavent to making @CAPS2 feel better @CAPS5 she said "The more details the funnier it is." I told her to continue. She continued, "@CAPS6 we got home @CAPS5 the parents started unloading the grocerys. While they were doing that @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I were in the living room teaching our dog how to sit, lay, shake, speak, @CAPS5 roll over. Everytime she did a trick we would give her half a dog treat. @CAPS17 the parents were done putting the grocerys away they walked in the living room @CAPS5 we showed them the tricks we had taught our dog, they had yet to see them.   After we showed them all @CAPS13 father had to say was "@CAPS7 @CAPS3 @CAPS12 put the dog treats up @CAPS6 she doesn'@CAPS11 get into them." I replied with a simple "@CAPS8." @CAPS6 the parents said they would be back that they were going to get pizza because they didn'@CAPS11 want to cook after a long day of shopping, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they left. While they were gone @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I straightened up the living room @CAPS5 continued to train the dog. @CAPS17 the parents got back we all sat @CAPS5 @CAPS5 began to watch @CAPS11.V. @CAPS5 eat our pizza. After @CAPS5 while @CAPS17 everyone was done eating we were still in the living room @CAPS5 @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I heard @CAPS13 dad in the kitchen complaining about not being able to find the cookies they @CAPS14 bought.   I looked at @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 said "@CAPS12 know what would be funny? @CAPS4 dad thought the dog treats were cookies @CAPS5 ate one." @CAPS13 sister giggled. Our dad came stomping into the living room @CAPS5 threw himself on the couch, acting like a four year old boy who @CAPS14 got his game taken away. We began to laugh @CAPS5 our dad looked over @CAPS5 scolded us, then looked back at the @LOCATION1. Then out of nowhere @CAPS15 said "I found them." Or what @CAPS15 thought was them. @CAPS15 reached for the dog treats on the coffee table.   @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I didn'@CAPS11 dare speak a word. We watched him. @CAPS15 looked at the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 reached his hand into the bag of dog treats @CAPS5 pulled one out. @CAPS15 looked at us @CAPS5 we looked away momentarilly. Then our eyes fixed right back on him, beyone our control. We @CAPS14 had to watch. @CAPS15 looked away to the @LOCATION1 again @CAPS5 put a whole dog treat in his mouth. @CAPS15 began to chew. Then @CAPS15 slowed down his chewing @CAPS5 tilted his head to the side, @CAPS14 like a dog would. What a coincidience. Then it sounded like @CAPS15 choked on a piece of it @CAPS5 @CAPS15 began to cough. @CAPS15 spit dog treats all over the back of @CAPS13 moms head who was sitting on the floor.   @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I began to laugh histariclly beyond our control. @CAPS13 dad was @CAPS14 sitting on the couch with a straight face, I swear we could see the smoke coming out of his ears. @CAPS15 began to yell about how we should have put the dog treats up @CAPS6 this wouldn'@CAPS11 happen but in mid sentence, @CAPS15 @CAPS14 couldn'@CAPS11 help it anymore. @CAPS15 began to laugh. @CAPS6 we were all laughing, then we look at @CAPS13 mom who was still sitting on the floor in still in shock because she got sprayed with chewed dog treats. We could stop laughing, @CAPS6 then she began to laugh." @CAPS17 she told @CAPS2 this story @CAPS5 laughed @CAPS6 had I cried. Then I realized "All @CAPS12 need is a little laughter in your day to brighten your life."

 Have you ever had a fear of falling off of a cliff when up in the mountain? I have, I actually had that experience. It was a @DATE1 @TIME2 @PERSON1 we had just gotten off of the bus. I had grabbed all of my gear from the storage from under the bus @PERSON1 headed for the slopes. we strapped in our boots @PERSON1 went to the lift to catch a chair up. I was with my friends @PERSON1, @PERSON1 all three of us joined the snowboard team at school that year. The three of us caught a chair up to the top of the run. The air was so crisp, @PERSON1 the snow was a fresh blanket of powder. We were all so excited to go ride in that perfect of a @TIME1. As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every @DATE1 @TIME1. so I talked to my friends @PERSON1 suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They agreed, so we went down through @TIME1 new area. It was a good trail with many jumps @PERSON1 a lot of powder. It seemed like a perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow, then suddenly, there was a drop right in front of us. I shifted my board sideways so I can stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that i hit, @PERSON1 it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell off, @PERSON1 braced for impact. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool @TIME1 with sparks lighting it up. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, trying to stop myself. As I came to a stop, I looked back wondering how I survived that. I was worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe on what just happened. I learned a lesson from @TIME1 of to always scope out the area first before you go through it. I luckily was not hurt, I could have been seriously injured.

 Laughter, everyone from babies to old people do it. Laughter is an element that helps in life. They say that "laughter is the best medicine" it truly is. Laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose. In any friendship, relationship, job or sport you need to laugh every once in a while. You can't always be serious. Being serious @NUM1 as they say is not good, it makes people seem like they don't know how to enjoy life or they have no sense of humor.  In the @DATE1 I had a rough volleyball season. A lot of my teammates had problems with me, because I was chosen as captain along side my friend @PERSON1. We weren't the most well liked, but we were liked by some. It was hard for @PERSON1 and I to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they did not want to deal with @PERSON1 and I being captains, but as they quit we moved people from junior varsity up to varsity. The new varsity members had it rough, they struggled a bit trying to get the hang, but they did it they managed to get the hang of how varsity plays and practices. Soon after our mishap of having to replace seven out of fourteen players we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest we had the whole season. In our first set of the we didn't exactly have our minds in it for the first of what would be come a five set, game. We battled back and forth a few points in the first set, but we ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do whether to give up or half-@CAPS1 it was tough, I as one of the captains said "@CAPS1, we won't get anywhere unless we @CAPS1." then @PERSON1 says "I agree, lets @CAPS1 our best and not let them get an easy win." We did exactly that we tried and we won that second set. It was the third set and we had started to get tired and feel aggravated, so we pushed forward we won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the court and the ball was served we let the ball hit the ground point one to the other team. After that first point it went down hill we let them get the best of us and they won the set. It had come down to the fifth and final set were we would either win or lose. We got on the court knowing that we might lose and started. The first point went to us we went back and forth a ton in the final set. It was a tough battle, but we had done it we won. Later in the season we met the team again and it was a hands down battle we had lost the second time we met them it was not easy at all they didn't allow any room for errors on their behalf, but us we let it all slip. It was time for the state playoffs we had made it to the state finals. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one. The line-up was called, national anthem sang, and the coin was flipped, we would receive the serve. The game was in full swing, we were doing great we won the first set by four a tough first game. We went into set two, we lost control. We didn't do what we were suppose to do. We lost the second set it was and confidence hitter. We were down we didn't know what to expect in set three, and as captains the team seeing @PERSON1 and I should have not let ourselves be down. We looked at each other with that look I knew and we just busted out laughing we couldn't stop the team wondered what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win we had to laugh we @MONTH1 feel down, but you have to laugh and the team did we went into the third set confident as ever and we won we didn't stop there we went into the fourth set and won. We had done what we set out to do win! In the end laughing was what we needed to do we had come this far that we could either give up or push and succeed. We looked at the two previous games that we had met the other team before and laughed. We made that our team motto "laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh" the season was great looking back on it we were state champs. Now in @DATE2 season we are hoping to repeat state champs.

 Laughter is a major component in a relationship. Laughter once saved my best freinds relationship with his girlfreind. They had just goten ito the bigest fight I have ever seen. The fight started over something so small and insignificant that neither of them could remember what it was. The fight had a snowball affect untill neither of them knew what they were fighting over. Then one day, while they were taking a break from fighting, we went to see a funny movie. A while into the movie I got up to go to the restroom, and when i got back my freind and his girlfreind were both lauphng histaricly. I asked them what was so funny, but they wouldn't tell me.  @CAPS4 the movie we went to a @CAPS1 restorant for dinner. While we were being seated my freind mumbled something i couldn't hear to his girlfreind, and she burst into laughter. I again asked what was so funny, and again they replied that it was nothing. During dinner, which was extrordiary for @CAPS1 food, my freinds girlfreind got up to go to the restroom. @CAPS4 she was out of earshot, my freind turned to me and said, "@CAPS3'll never beleive what just happened. Me and her aren't fighting any more. @CAPS4 @CAPS3 left to go to the restroom, I asked her if she could remember what we were fighting over, and she said she had no idea and was just fighting because she diddn't want to loose the arguement. @CAPS4 she said that I fessed up and said i was argueing for the same reason. this made us laugh so hard because we boh realized that the argument could have been over long befor that night." @CAPS4 this I almost never heard of them fighting again. This was untill they got into another arguement when she moved out of state. The arguement was over the fact that he wanted to do a long distance relationship, but she didn't want to. Since laughter saved their relationship for a little while I strongly believe that Laughter is an important part of a relationship. It also serves as an excelent ice breaker for a conversation.

            @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2! Laughter, you need it to survive in this world. Someone should laugh at least ten times a day. Have you ever heard, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile? Well, I believe that it is true. It's more convenent to be happy than being sad. According to me.  In @DATE2, my family was living in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1. My mom and dad had @NUM1 baby girls, before my brother and I were born. It was a beautiful snowy morning on @DATE1... Christmas! My sister, @PERSON1 in a bright yellow dress was @CAPS13 excited to be getting presents and cake! As soon as @CAPS6 opened a big battery powered monster truck, her beautiful clear blue eyes got as big as watermelons!  @PERSON1 walked over steddily, and climbed into the huge truck. There was only one problem, @CAPS6 couldn't reach the pedals. Everyone stood there, silent... then they started busting up laughing because @PERSON1 awkwardly looked like @CAPS6 was dancing in the truck beacuse @CAPS6 was trying to reach the pedals. Then my mom said, "@CAPS3 someone should go help @PERSON1 get going on the truck." @CAPS4 that was probably the worst idea ever!  My @CAPS2 is @NUM2 years old, and about @NUM3 pounds, and not in the best shape. @CAPS6 said annoyed, "@CAPS5 I'll help @PERSON1." @CAPS6 rolled up off the couch and stood by @PERSON1 and the truck. My dad was giggling in the background. My @CAPS2 said seriously,"I need a stick or something to push on the "go" pedal." @CAPS6 went and found a long stick outside in the snow. They decided that they should try it outside because @PERSON1 wanted to feel the chilling wind on her baby soft face as @CAPS6 was riding in the truck. @CAPS13 my mom bundled up @PERSON1 in @NUM1 jackets, gloves, and a beanie. Somehow they got on top of a @NUM5 foot snowy, and slippery hill we live on. My @CAPS2 pushed down on the "go" pedal and it went forward @CAPS4 the front tires got caught on her long dress @CAPS6 was wearing and ran her over! The next thing we know, @CAPS6 is tumbling down the hill screaming on the top of her lungs! That's when her red flowered dress flew up and we could see her tong. My sister said loudly,"That's gross @CAPS2!" @CAPS9 just some minor bruises and scratches my @CAPS2 was @CAPS5. That was the @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2 ever! I watched it on the @CAPS11 video.  We @MONTH1 put that video on the "@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12." @CAPS13 if you see it, just remember me chuckling in the back of her head. @CAPS13 remember, you should always laugh or smile more than frown or be mad. Laughter, is the key to a happy life!

 Laughter  @CAPS1 brings enthusiasm and joyfulness to any means or matter. Have you ever thought of laughter being a part or key element in a relationship? A time when laughter has really helped or made a relationship is when I met one of my still today best friends. I had just started fifth grade at a new school; I transferred from private to public. There was only a couple of people I knew there because of family, and these people were my cousins. As you can imagine I sat by the people whom I known for most of my life, and being in this position was very awkward. So, eventually at the end of the day I was ready to leave school and it was my first time I ever got to walk home since this school was much closer than my last. I had to walk home with a kid who lived right by me; this I had never known because of my sheltered young life. Luckily he was easy to talk to and we both had something in common which was skateboarding. This is when we started @CAPS1 because we talked about certain falls we had which were not so pleasant and he asked if we could hang out after school, and with me as a shy guy I said okay. After awhile, he came over with his skateboard and he told me to go down this ramp I had. So, I did and fell right on my back which we both thought was hilarious and we started @CAPS1 together. This @CAPS1 we did since walking home really made me feel comfortable with him and kind of bonded us. I feel that fall was a key part of our friendship because it made the awkwardness go right out the window and helped us start talking about more funny thing which we had seen. Ever since, every time we hang out something happens and we laugh as hard as you can imagine which goes down in our memories as good times. @CAPS1 has always "sweetened the mood" so to say and always makes a good time a great time to remember or to a truly boring time to a "lets go do something" time. Also, in any situation when I have been @CAPS1, or start to laugh, I feel good because every one laughs when I laugh. Most of my friends are also my friends because of my laughs and times I make them laugh. All in all, most of the relationships I have are because of @CAPS1 and how they comfort two or even more people by bonding them, and making every one feel like their having a good time with each other. This is key because than most encounters with people, even friends can be very awkward or not enjoyable. So, really in any case @CAPS1 is necessity because than every thing would be dull, plus you would really have no one to be able to have an appreciative time with. Therefore, every time I meet someone new or even someone I know laughter needs to exist in order to have a relationship with anyone.

 A lot of people always say that a sense of humor is very important when looking for a significant other, or even a friend. @CAPS4 some people don't realize @CAPS1 how much laughter can bring people together! I know now that all it takes is for two people to laugh together to become great friends. My best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 became my friends by doing @CAPS1 that. All my life I've gone to small schools with my aunt, @LOCATION1. We are only two years apart so we usually can stay within the same @ORGANIZATION1, so I never feel alone. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 ended up going to a different @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 than me. I would have to face @ORGANIZATION1 on my own. My freshman year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I was pretty nervous. It was my first time at a huge @ORGANIZATION1, I had @CAPS1 moved and I didn't know anyone, so I was pretty shy. I made my first friend pretty easily during one of my classes; @CAPS3. @PERSON4, the teacher, wanted us to have partners, so that we could do a certain exercise together. @PERSON2 and I both chose each other for some reason, I don't know how, @CAPS4 we were drawn to each other. @PERSON4 told us we would be doing the "mirror exercise". We picked somebody to be the mover, and somebody to be the mirror. @PERSON2 ended up being the mover. I had to follow her movements exactly so that @PERSON4 wouldn't be able to tell who the mirror was, @CAPS4 when @PERSON2 started acting like a monkey, we both laughed and @PERSON4 even laughed too. During lunch, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friend, @PERSON1. @CAPS2 claimed to have known her for several years. @PERSON1 and I smiled at each other, @CAPS4 we didn't really talk at all. By the time my last class of the day came around, I was ready to go home, @CAPS5 because it was a @CAPS6 class, I never really liked @CAPS6. I came to find that I shared that class with <@NUM1!</@CAPS7> @CAPS8 we met already, and shared @PERSON2 as a friend, we sat by each other. We still didn't have much to say though. A few days went by and we still didn't really talk, we @CAPS1 awkwardly sat next to one another. Meanwhile, @PERSON2 and I became closer friends, acting out silly skits together in @CAPS3 class laughter was bringing us together, @CAPS4 I didn't really notice, because it wasn't any different then how I've made most of my friends.  One day, we had testing in our @CAPS6 class, we had to go to the computer lab. @PERSON1 and I chose computers next to each other, we started our tests silently, same as always. Then, suddenly @CAPS2 turned to me and asked me if I had ever heard the "@CAPS11 @CAPS12". When I, very startled, replied no, @CAPS2 sang it for me, right there in the middle of the computer lab. When @CAPS2 finished we both started laughing so hard that it hurt. Our teacher warned us to be quiet, and we got back to testing with smiles on our faces. After that moment, everything changed! Like magic, @PERSON1 and I started talking and joking all the time! @PERSON2 noticed the change, @CAPS2 was glad we were getting along so well, @CAPS4 wondered what caused the sudden difference. To this day, @PERSON1 and I share laughs whenever we have the time for it. Even though I am busy with babysitting, @ORGANIZATION1, and my job. While @CAPS2 goes to college, nothing can stop the connection we made that day, through the power of laughter! I have learned that laughter is a top basis for any relationship. @CAPS4 it is not the only one. You also need to have trust. If you can't trust some one, @CAPS4 they are humorous, that doesn't make them a good friend. You also need a sense of safety. If your friends are encouraging you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable, they aren't very good friends. I know that @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 are the best friends I will ever have. Laughter brought us together and I know it will keep us together for generations to come!

 @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, "@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. "@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her." I began to chuckle. "@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. "@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?" I asked kicking a rock. "@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself." @CAPS2 muttered looking away. "@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way." I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. "@CAPS9 you reckon that is?" @PERSON3 asked. "@CAPS10 some dead animal." @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. "We're out of jerky, all gone." @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. "@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?" @CAPS2 spatted. "@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11." @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. "@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. "@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin." "@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded." "@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine." @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, "I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11," @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. "@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep." "@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?" @PERSON3 asked. "@CAPS23." @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. "@CAPS9 you looking for?" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. "@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. "@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours," I said sitting down against the door. "@CAPS29 all you find?" @PERSON3 muttered. "@CAPS30." I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. "I'm scarred, you scarred?" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. "@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper," I began to chuckle. "@CAPS20, that is true," @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever.

 Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to "spy" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, "@CAPS2 that really sucked." Or you can look at things and be like, "That is hilarious." @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same.

  The comfort of a laugh. Many different kinds of comfort can come from a laugh. My story is the comfort of love. @CAPS6 i was a young and foolish teen. (@CAPS1 wait that's what i would still be today.) A few days ago my friend @CAPS2 had me laughing so hard, and all because @CAPS5 slipped up while meeting my mother. (@CAPS2 was nerves to meet my mother.) For some reason @CAPS6 i started to laugh @CAPS5 suddenly began to act as if every thing was fine, and that there was nothing to be nerves about.  @CAPS7 latter @CAPS6 we went for our walk i asked him about it. I simply said "@CAPS4 did your mood change @CAPS6 i began to laugh?" @CAPS5 smiled and replied "@CAPS6 you laugh i feel calm and know that i am going to be alright." @CAPS7 myself being a typical teen girl i blushed, @CAPS7 quickly changed topics, while trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly i could not help my self. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek was over powering my will to not look. Turning my head slowly, sure enough there @CAPS5 was starring straight back in to my eyes, his eyes were wonderful they reminded me of sunflowers with a blue sky behind them. As @CAPS5 stared back i got a feeling as if @CAPS5 were trying to unlock all that i am, and all that i know with his eyes. As if @CAPS5 could see straight to my soul. Quickly I turned away. With a soft and almost beautiful voice @CAPS5 let a little laugh out. This laugh was as sweet to my ears, as nectar is to a hummingbird.  The next few days where hard. All i could think about was that walk. People must have thought i was crazy, every time i would remember the walk, each time i would remember his laugh. @CAPS7 let a laugh of my own out. @CAPS7 i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life. For me i laugh @CAPS6 I'm with the people i love. For some its watching t.v. that they find amusing, or maybe there kids did some thing rather silly. So silly you had to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is every where.  Laughter is never a bad thing in fact it has been proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits. Some people don't get it. Laughter is not some thing to be ashamed of ether, if some one laughs at you just laugh with them. Its not laughter that starts wars. its not laughter that kills people. its people who chose not to fill there lives with the joy of laughter.  So here is the goal. laughter can also be very contagious. So try and @CAPS8 a laugh on. Do some thing that @CAPS6 people remember it they will start there own laughs. Laughter-@CAPS8 it on!

 Laughter is a sign of good relationships. To some people it's a sign of personality, sign of love and also a sign showing someone that you care.  To me laughter is what makes people so unique. Everybody has a different kind of laugh. For example, when you are a baby @CAPS2 laugh is high pitched. The older you get the lower @CAPS2 laugh becomes, "like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1". If it was not for his laugh would not be who he is. When I was a child I remember trying to laugh like just like @ORGANIZATION1 did. I would be walking around the house trying to get my laugh really @CAPS1. My family though it was the best thing ever. They would ask me to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 so they can get a laugh also.  Now today my laugh is what I wanted it to be, "@CAPS1". It is hard for me to laugh quietly now. I have had some people tell me things like; "@CAPS2 laugh is what I will remember you by" or "@CAPS2 laugh is really something else". I love my laugh because it is part of who I am. With out laughter you, me, or anybody else wont be they are now. Laughter is one way to show emotion. So go ahead and try different kinds of laughs. No matter what you can not change the one you were meant to have.

 In my storie I am going to tell you about a funny time in my life where me, and my brother liked to pull pranks on my aunt.   @CAPS1 first paragraph is about the first prank that we pulled on my aunt. when i was about six and my brother was four and my aunt had just bought a beautiful purple suade couch, she loved @CAPS1 couch, and me and my brother at the time thought that my aunt had loved @CAPS1 couch more then she loved us. So me and my little brother took two jugs of chocolate syrup, and poor them all over my aunts brand new three thousand dollar couch.    The second prank was just myself, and one day i was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. I was getting very frustrated with the game and i threw my controller down, man my aunt ran over and pop me in the back of my head so fast,and she told me to be a good sport and try it again. But i was upset because i just got popped in the back of my head so i was looking for some revenge, when my aunts goes into the bathroom to go put in her make-@CAPS3 for work, I go into the kitchen and get a grape soda, I walk over to my aunts purse crack open the grape soda and poor it all over the inside of my aunts purse.  The last paragraph is about the worst prank that me and my little brother have ever pulled. One morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was sleep, me and my little brother were sitting on the couch watching television and my little brother says that he has to go to the bathroom and knowing us kids we do everything together so me and my brother go @CAPS3 stairs to the bathroom, and we see the biggest box of fifty-four rolls of soft, lushes toilet paper.Me and my little brother love toilet paper rolls for whatever reason, so we open the box and my brother drops one in the toilet, so I put one in the toilet, then he puts another one in the toilet, then i flush it. Little did we know that it would back fire at us and the toilet started to over flow, but i kept flushing. Then i get another roll and start unwrapping it all over the floor, the my brother gets one and @DATE1 we are knees deep in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt walks through the front door, we don't here her because we are having so much fun in toilet paper and water, then she comes @CAPS3 stairs, goes to the bathroom too see me and my brother and a bathroom thrashed, full of toilet paper and water. But the only thing that she says to us is. CLEAN @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! She slams the door then me and my brother look at eachother then start cleaning. Then finally after hours of cleaning the bathroom is back to the way it should be.   @CAPS1 is the conclusion of my storie about the three worst pranks that me and my little brother have pulled on our aunt.

 Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to spark a smile. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories, or thoughts of nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broke the news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE1, right after school was over. The first reaction out of my mouth was filled with entreatment, wishing for my best friend to join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thoughtfully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and rapidly responded in the affirmative. I was thrilled to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now to include my best friend.  First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON1, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an exuberant "@CAPS1!," I was @CAPS4 first devastated when she postponed her response and didn'@CAPS6 seem too excited. I didn'@CAPS6 consider the fact that there @MONTH1 have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS3 join us. The two of us together couldn'@CAPS6 have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON1 and I made a countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into hand while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 the time, so she gave us a tour of the island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1!  Many humorous occurrences happened often while we were on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom has always had a way to make every situation hilarious, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls night. First, and most significant of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of varied small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS6-shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS4 all of the designs, that I think we ended up carrying a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night.  As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the town center, we worked our way back up to the room, laughing and involved in pointless girl talk. The three of us girls shuffled with smiles, sore feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON1 carried on a story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn'@CAPS6 have a key card to open our room's door, the three of us decided that we should just knock on the door and my father would answer. "@CAPS2 was supposed to be back from renting our surf boards by now, so why isn'@CAPS6 @CAPS2 answering?" we thought, "@CAPS3 @CAPS2 still be out on the beach?" @CAPS4 this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do. I sent a message to my dad's cell phone, and @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up pounding on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @CAPS2 was playing a joke on us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I began to notice a low buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS3 barely keep from laughing. It was then that it hit me, and I said to both of them, "@CAPS5 guys! We didn'@CAPS6 leave a @CAPS6.V. on!" We immediately halted our intrusion, moved as quickly as we @CAPS3 away from the door, and continued to howl with laughter. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on the elevator! We were so absorbed in having a good time that we didn'@CAPS6 even realize we were bothering someone, and embarassing ourselves! It wasn'@CAPS6 just one moment or one trip, it is now a lifetime of joy because I can look back on those memories and smile @CAPS4 them. It's these moments that I treasure the most.

 Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, which alone are two powerful and essential things to life. There was a time not too long ago that I was able to turn a girl's tears to laughter and made her day a little better.It all starts with the craze of today's teenage world, "@CAPS1". Which to those who don't know, it is a website where teens spend quite a lot of time on, and people can comunicate through this website. I log in and see that this girl I like is also signed in, so I start talking to her. The normal teenage conversation of, "@CAPS2, whats up?" that sort of thing happens, and then she asks if I am able to hang out. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but most guys would go hang out if its a girl they like. I went to meet up with her at the library and as always, she was beautiful, even though I doubt she was trying. As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could thing about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not. To my luck, it actually helped, and she started smiling. After a little while, I had her laughing and having a good time. Since that day, we have been dating, and are really happy, and everyday when I see her I say something random to make her smile.

            The Element of @CAPS1 and Laughter Laughter is an important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood. Laughing is a good part in a persons life; it shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a laugh. Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their emotions; other people laugh to hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at peoples accidents while others don't. Emotions are a big deal in a persons life. Some emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. Being happy makes people want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much, they will actually start crying from it. People like other people @CAPS4 are in a happy or joyful mood, because then they can receive those good feelings as well; therefore, it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well.  Another thing that makes people laugh are jokes. Some jokes can be very funny, other jokes can be gross, and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them. But jokes can get complicated at times; to a little kid you can say, "@CAPS2, @CAPS2!" "@CAPS4's there?" "@CAPS5." "@CAPS5 @CAPS4?" "@CAPS5 @CAPS4?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke," and the kid would be laughing. But to someone @CAPS4 is older, you have to think a little more to get them to laugh. People love laughter; they like laughing at peoples jokes and especially at hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. Like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get pranked is alergic to garlic. But most of the time, funny things help people cheer up when they are down. Furthermore, accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times, but at other times, some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people. Some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other. For example, a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board, but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all. It is like when someone says that they a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around. You might think that you have something funny to say, but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that wasn't funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life. It is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. Enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs, don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time, be happy. Laughter is a good thing; people love it so don't always be serious and at least share some laughs with your friends or loved ones.

Laughter Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable, bring two people together or just show your having a good time. In my experiences laughter comes at the best of times. On a typical @ORGANIZATION1 day at @ORGANIZATION1 I was sitting with my friends at lunch time just hanging out talking about whats going on in our lives, when I notice a girl sitting all alone. I don't recognize her, she must be a new student. I ask around to see if anyone knows anything about her; no one knows. Looking back at the girl she looks very lonely and in need of a friend. Curious to meet someone new I walk over to her and make conversation after a little while we relax and start to talk about our interests. I remember her saying something funny and I started to laugh, she begins to laugh at my laugh being as its almost hysterical sounding and everyone thinks it sounds ridiculous. At that moment as were sitting there laughing together I realize, its bringing us together making us closer despite the fact we had just met but ten minutes ago.  Laughter makes life more enjoyable and happy knowing that you can share that with someone you have just met or someone you have known your whole life is magical. Its a universal language that everyone should speak. Laughing is healthy and good for the heart.

 There was this time during @CAPS1 vacation, and their was a lot of snow o n the ground. My cousin @CAPS2, brother @CAPS3 and I were all getting together and going to go out to my grandparents. My brother @CAPS3 lives in @LOCATION2 and my cousin @CAPS2, and I live here in @LOCATION1. So it wasn't that hard trying to get us cousins all together. We were all getting together to go out to my grandparents and go snowmobiling together and stay the night out their for a couple of nights. When all got together, and were starting to go out there it was getting to late to go snowmobiling. We were all very kind of sad but it was okay. We just watched movies off direct @LOCATION3, and waited for the morning to come. Once morning came of course it was way to cold to go out right when we woke up. So we made a big breakfast and after breakfast we all got ready and than sat around until it was warmer to go outside. Finally it was the afternoon! We all got dressed into warm clothes to go out an go snowmobiling. We all went outside and my grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could pull us from behind with it. My grandpa was driving the snowmobile and us kids were in the back. My grandma only went one once with us and than she got off because my grandpa was going way to crazy n we were all getting hit by each other when he was driving. Then once us kids were the only ones on the hood by grandpa was starting to go really fast! I was the only one who was covered in snow, and i looked like a snowman. It was so funny! My grandpa went running inside to get my grandpas camera so she could take some pictures. It took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures. Then when she was done we went back to snowmobiling for the rest of the day. After we got all done for the day I than really looked like a snowman. It was a fun day, and very funny how I looked as a snowman, but afterwords I got really cold. We went inside and I went right in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma was making hot chocolate for all of us.

 We were heading to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat, crammed together in our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the top, along with six other kids, occupying all of the other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seating arrangements didn't seem to ruin our fun, within five minutes of our road trip, the van exploded with laughter, as @PERSON1, most likely a future comedian started off cracking jokes, just being himself as usual. Within those first five minutes of our drive, I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I would always remember.  The van rolled up to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend. The sky had turned black with the @TIME1, and me along with everyone else trudged along with weary eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to hop into our beds, needing to be well rested for our first ski race of the season. Shortly after, everyone was soon in bed, knowing that five a.m. would be coming quickly. The sun began rising over the mountains, signaling time to wake up. This was not the case for me. I had been up for nearly an hour, and sat in our van while we sped around each corner up to the mountain. It was race day, and me, along with all of my teammates were all excited for the day coming. The morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and inspection of the course. I now stood at the top of the hill peering down at the course ahead of me. I had to focus. While I have had a lot of fun, it was time to concentrate, to preform my absolute best. The pressure was on. I now stood in the start gate, my coach stood by my side, and my friends were watching as well, cheering me on. I was hoping not to disappoint. "@CAPS2 ready," the official began in a tense voice, "@CAPS3!" I threw my self our of the start gate. I flew by each gate, staying in control and most important, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolled with each turn. Everything was going well until I broke over the knoll. My body compressed bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied over the roller, throwing me off balance. I fought to get back up, to regain myself, but I couldn't do it. My skis spun out from under me, causing me to be spit out from the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, hopeless and done for. It was over. I sat in the snow frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @PERSON1, one of my teammates, came up to me and sat in the snow by my side. My first thought was he was going to say something of a cliche "nice job," or a "you'll do better next time". To my surprise he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns up, trying to contain a laugh, unsuccessful, I burst into laughter. @PERSON1 sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick "thanks," with a smile before we both @CAPS3 to watch and cheer on our teammates. Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day, I skied two solid runs with top finishes, if I had stayed upset with myself, I would have never been able to achieve those results. I came to realize that some days, just a small laugh can be all you need to turn any day around. Laughter, I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean many different things for many different people, laughter could be a special bond between to people. Laughter can remove the seriousness or competitively in a situation, but also it unites us. Languages are different among people, but everyone understands a what a laugh can do, a laugh is universal.

                                        The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter seems to be almost the basis of ones relationship with friends, with no laughter, there is no spark of interest of wanting to be someones friend. When I think of laughter, I think of the times when I go to @ORGANIZATION1. Even @CAPS2 I have had the most horrible day, I know that the girls I play with on that team, who are like a second family to me, can always cheer me up by the things they say or do. The underlying relationship between a @ORGANIZATION1 team becomes unknown to the outside; no one really knows how much we laugh together, or how much frustration builds up between us. Frustration @MONTH1 get the best of us sometimes but I can think of a lot more memories where I was laying on the turf field laughing because a dumb decision of a player, turns into on of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I remember the first time I had a @ORGANIZATION1 practice, back in @DATE1 of second grade, I was playing with many girls who had gone to a different school and I had never seen before. All of the girls decided that they wanted to see who was the best at juggling a @ORGANIZATION1 ball on there knees. It came my turn to try, and as i went to bump it with my knee, it hit in the wrong spot so it came back up and hit me in the nose, leaving it bloody. I had no idea how to react, so I started to laugh. At the time, a girl I had never seen before started to laugh with me, and came up and gave me a tissue. Believe it or not the girl who gave me a tissue that first day became my best friend, and has been ever since. The laughter that occurred that day filled the gap of distance between us. Since that day we have never had an awkward silence wondering what we should say or do.   Entering the fall of fourth grade, I had just joined the @ORGANIZATION1 team @ORGANIZATION1, still playing with the same girls, with the exception of a few people. I had no idea what to think of those people or what to say, so i decided on not saying anything. We had been playing monkey in the middle and I was guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS3, who had extremely good talents but was a little clumsy. She had started to run for the ball, and low and behold the clumsy girl tripped on nothing! Thoughts were racing through my mind; should I laugh? Will she hate me @CAPS2 I do? What @CAPS2 she's actually hurt? Though these thoughts @MONTH1 become reality, I went with my instinct and burst with laughter. She rolled over to see who had starting laughing at her accidental trip, and started laughing as well. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we had gone to the same school but never associated with one another. From that day on we became inseparable at school, and became best friends.  The next story has nothing to do with @ORGANIZATION1, but everything to do with laughter. Though there is no certain story that I could tell you in particular that happened between this girl and I, all I can say is she is the one who gave me the first experience of laughing until you cry. I remember her moving to our school, and I was no longer the "new girl". At first, I thought she was the weirdest person that I had ever met, but as time progressed I had come to find out that she @MONTH1 be one of the funniest people I have ever met. @CAPS2 I would have made the realization beforehand that this girl had the personality she did, I would have went up to her in a heartbeat and made friends, instead of hiding behind the crowd. Ever since we became friends our friendship has been based upon how much we laugh together, and I wouldn't have it an other way. In the end the person who once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people", was absolutely correct. I used these stories above to show no matter how shy, or awkward a person @MONTH1 be, sharing a laugh with a new person is the easiest way to find a best friend. When I was introduced to laughter by these three people, I started to become more social throughout my middle school years, and now onto my high school career as well. @CAPS2 I lived a life without laughter, I would lose the life I have, and it would be filled with dull memories that are not worth sharing, and to me, that is definitely not worth it. Over the past six years, I have gained three best friends due to laughter, this really does go to show that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and is truly a @CAPS1 to have it.

 Laughter is a daily part of my life. I'm always laughing in school or at home. With laughter you can show many emotions that can't be told with words. To me, it's also a way of showing how fortunate your life is. I've had numerous occasions where laughter was the solution to my problem. I also agree that laughter is an important part of a relationship. In then next paragraphs, I am going to talk about how laughter affects my relationship and the benefits it brings to it as well. Approximately three months ago my family and I decided to take a trip to @LOCATION2. We planned to stay there for a month or so. When I told my boyfriend that I'd be gone for a month, right away I saw the sadness in his eyes. This truly killed me however, our decision was made and there was no turning back.  Our relation was tense during that month. We talked a few times but his voice was different. There was a sadness to it and I knew something was wrong. Although he said everything was good I knew his sadness was due to my absence.  After the month had finally ended it was time to come back to @LOCATION3! I was truly excited. We arrived at @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 at @TIME1 on a @DATE1 @TIME2. I immediately called him but there was no chance of seeing him that same @TIME2. Although, just knowing that I was closer to him made me happy and anxious. We conversed for endless hours, telling each other that we would never be that far again. We laughed and laughed during our whole conversation. To me the sound of his laughter was a sign of his happiness and that was just priceless. The laughter was as if it had been a blessing to our relation. From that day on forward, I realized how much laughter really affects me in numerous ways. It's as if it brings happiness and prosperity to my life. With just a laugh sadness leaves and that's when happiness jumps in.

 A couple of months ago i was hanging out with my freind @CAPS1. It was a @DATE1 and i came to her to spend the @TIME1.At first we were extreamly bored so we went on a walk to go find something to do.We found our friend dylan at the skatepark and we stopped to talk to him for a while. After we had hung out there for about two hours we headed back up to her house.When we opened the door her sister started freaking out because we left so she got stucked with there younger brother @PERSON1. @CAPS1 didn't yell back, she didn't want the drama. Her sister got even more mad because jesssika was not showing a reaction to what her sister was doing. By ten minutes she exploded and started throwing herself around and freaking out. Me and @CAPS1 looked at each other and stated laughing really reallyhard because how funny her sister looked. @TIME1 after her mom had calmed the sistuation down, @CAPS1 and I made a @CAPS3 bed on her bedroom floor and when we were falling asleep we bothbursted out in laughter it was the funnest @TIME1 i have had in a long time.

                             Living, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter     @CAPS4 to this @DATE1 I don't remember exactly why I was laughing. All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfathers face. He had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that @DATE1, so many years ago, he shined his happiness @CAPS1 love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My @CAPS16, who we all called @CAPS5, had a way of keeping the peace @CAPS1 happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry @CAPS3 @CAPS5, @CAPS1 no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was. @CAPS5 was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on my @DATE1 @DATE1 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. That @DATE1 was our family's @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5, soon after, he passed away. When I look back @CAPS1 realize how important that @DATE1 was I can see that it was a perfect @CAPS8 for everyone. It was a happy @DATE1 @CAPS1 my @DATE1 memories of my @CAPS16 were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.     When that @CAPS8 kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Every one in my family was in high spirits @CAPS1 was ready to enjoy the @DATE1 @CAPS3 family. My favorite activity during each @CAPS1 every family event is to play my favorite games @CAPS3 everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called @CAPS12-@CAPS13. Now @CAPS12-@CAPS13 was one of the many games that my @CAPS16 was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, @CAPS1 would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced @CAPS5 @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON1 to play @CAPS12-@CAPS13 @CAPS3 me. We went into the spare room @CAPS1 starting dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, @CAPS1 to no ones surprise, @CAPS5 was winning. It was just before the food was ready @CAPS1 we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin @PERSON1, or @CAPS5 said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny @NUM1 year old ears had ever heard, @CAPS1 I began to laugh.     My family was so thoroughly entertained @CAPS3 my laughter that they could not keep their smiles @CAPS1 laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy to my family, including my @CAPS16. @CAPS5' smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful @CAPS1 vivid in front of me,that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. @CAPS5' smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.    No one knew that was our @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the @DATE1 I would spend @CAPS3 my @CAPS16. Everything was so perfect @CAPS1 so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, @CAPS1 if I had to choose my @DATE1 @CAPS8, that @DATE1 would be perfect. My single memory of that @DATE1 was laughing, @CAPS1 being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my @DATE1 bit a time @CAPS3 @CAPS5 then a @DATE1 where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, @CAPS1 smiles.    Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, @CAPS1 can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt @CAPS1 never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, "@CAPS25. Laugh. Love." I believe those three words can combine together, @CAPS1 act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to @CAPS25 out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, @CAPS1 love. Love brings us all together, @CAPS1 when we strive to be happy @CAPS1 to love, that is when we can truly @CAPS25. My grandfather loved each @CAPS1 every one of his family @CAPS1 friends @CAPS1 made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever @CAPS25 it. He died after a life full of love happiness @CAPS1, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter.

 Some people say that laughter is good for the soul, and that could be true, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughing is great for your heart and mind too. It can improve relationships, make friendships grow stronger, and even start @CAPS5 make two people who don't know anything about each other, extremely close. You can meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want @CAPS5 get @CAPS5 know them better. I love that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have @CAPS5 be @NUM1 and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last @DATE1 I never had anything @CAPS5 do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next @CAPS5 my house, or an old folks home about @NUM2 miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying @CAPS5 make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences. I started with the daycare. I woke up at @NUM3 am, and walked @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION1. I wasn't sure what it was going @CAPS5 be like at all. I didn't even know if i was good with kids. I walked in, and stood @CAPS3 awkwardly. The @ORGANIZATION1 manager came up @CAPS5 me and asked me if i could help out with the @NUM4 year old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously.  Was i supposed @CAPS5 color for them? @CAPS3's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if i follow directions then this day will get @CAPS2 faster. When i went in @CAPS3 all the kids ran up @CAPS5 me with a smile on their face. "@CAPS1 by me!" one said. "@CAPS2 here!" said another. "@CAPS3's a spot right here!" "@CAPS4 at my picture!" "I drew a rainbow!" "I drew a car!" "I drew you!" @CAPS5 that, i looked down. @CAPS3 i was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that i absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them. The next week a went @CAPS5 the nursing home. I was even more nervous @CAPS3. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going @CAPS5 be helping with yet, so I sat on a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who i was her @CAPS5 see, i said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, oh, I was going @CAPS5 volunteer. She led me down the hall told me that it was almost time for lunch so i needed @CAPS5 get ready @CAPS5 serve lunch. I did, and then the i heard, what i assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were @CAPS3 took naps after lunch, so @CAPS3 were only three people out @CAPS3. I played first with a lady who used @CAPS5 be a nurse. I got @CAPS5 know her pretty well in the half hour we played the game; which i won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the @LOCATION1 war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used @CAPS5 be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few @CAPS5 many, because he beat me at chess. Well that was my excuse. When i got done, i was in a great mod and i could't wait @CAPS5 come back again. I learned a lot that @DATE1. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have @CAPS5 be the same as the person your with, @CAPS5 laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying @CAPS5 make the best of your day. I am so glad i decided @CAPS5 volunteer, otherwise i would have never known so much about people, love, life, and laughter.

 Looking back on my early childhood, one thing that stands out bright and shiny in my memory is laughter. Since birth, I have always loved to smile and laugh. I've found a kind of comfort, peace, and confidence through laughter alone, which I doubt I would have been able to find somewhere else naturally. This could, in part, be because of my @CAPS1. We rarely get to see each other because he lives in @LOCATION2 and I live in @LOCATION3, but when we do have the luxury of spending time together, it is always full of laughter, and full of joy. I credit him for giving my my love for laughter. I've been told by my parents that as a baby all my @CAPS1 had to do was laugh, and my eyes brightened and a smile became apparent as wide as the @LOCATION1 on my face. It's been that way ever since. One of my earliest memories I have is laying on my parent's bed listening to my @CAPS1 tell me jokes. Every time he finished I would erupt in laughter, and, at the sight of me laughing, he would burst out too. The important detail to note is, when my @CAPS1 laughs, his belly shakes violently like @ORGANIZATION1. I found this the greatest part of the jokes. Once his belly started bouncing up and down, my laughter became uncontrollable. Our laughter escalated until tears were streaming down our faces. Besides having a belly that bounces when he laughs, my @CAPS1 has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs one has ever been lucky enough to hear. It's one of those fabulous and enriching laughs which words do not do justice, but once you hear it, you won't ever forget it. His laughter can light up the darkest room in a house. For me, his laugh almost has medicinal healing. Whenever I hear my @CAPS1 laugh, for just a moment, the world stops, and everything within is okay. I am not the only one who has a great appreciation for my @CAPS1's laugh. My father and him both have a love for telling jokes, which I have observed over the years, is one of the few items they hold a common agreement on. Everything from politics, to religion, to who should pay for dinner, usually ends in an argument between them. Because of that, they tend to stay clear of those topics for fear of confrontation. They have never mentioned this, but from my observation over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the laughter they share so often, acts as the glue which keeps their relationship strong. Were it not for laughter, I sometimes wonder if they would still have a working, loving relationship. I will forever be thankful for the great gift my @CAPS1 unknowingly gave me at such a young age. He created a deep and passionate love for laughter inside me, which has gotten me through the roughest times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they are bonded for a moment in a precious, fragile, and sacred way. My day can be going horribly, and in the instant that a joke is cracked, and laughter overwhelms my body, everything brightens and the worries and stresses of my day seem so minute. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson that my @CAPS1 taught me. If you can find humor, you can find serenity in the most disastrous moments. Laughter, to me, is somewhat like a drug. It's a harmless, enriching, and life-saving drug which I can proudly say I hope to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @CAPS1.

Laughter is such a marvelous element to have in any relationship. For instance if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship than I'm pretty sure there is no strong connection between the two of you. For example I was in a relationship once where we didn't have that element of humor, and I truthfully did not enjoy that relationship that her and I had. Any type of relationship needs laughter rather its friendships, boyfriend or girlfriends, and even family. All different types of relationships need some form of humor to survive. Sometimes families don't have that humor for each other but they'll still have that special type of a friendship, the reason for that I believe is because your family will always be there for you unlike most friends would. One way I know this because one of my friends really liked a guy, I could have sworn she @MONTH1 have even loved him, when he told her that he started dating some girl, she had cried for weeks, than when she was at her moms house one of her brothers she believed hated her said he wants to hurt the guy that had made his younger sister cry. They @MONTH1 not of had a humorous friendship, or even a friendship at all, but I believe laughter isn't necessarily always needed especially within family. All types of relationships are like plants, the flower is the relationship and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong. But without that water the plant wont grow, just like laughter in a relationship. I know that if I knew someone who I did not find to be humorous I know our friendship would not be very strong, unlike someone who I felt was hilarious. Laughter is always a important element in everyday life. For instance if you are going for a job interview you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression for yourself. One way of doing that is through laughter, I have heard of many stories about job interviews, a example of one is my mom had a interview not to long ago for a @CAPS1 job and she told me about her interview and she said they had really connected. Their was also some seriousness and some laughter in that interview than three days later they emailed her and told her that she got the job and that they would love to hire her. and I have heard of interviews where they didn't get the job. My sister had a interview once for a pet kennel type of place where they drop their pets off there while they go on vacation, and she said that her and the person interviewing her had no connection which had led to no humor or laughter. So I believe humor is such a marvelous element to have within a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness.

 Laughter is key. You never really think about laughter in importance, but the truth is, laughing brings the most opposite people together. Last year, I met one of my brothers friends in school. We never really talked but she seemed nice. We had a class together and we started talking more and more everyday and she was best friends with my best friend.  @PERSON1 was her name and she drove a bright orange @ORGANIZATION1. We hung out after school one day and I leaned the passenger seat all the way back and was sitting on it like a dog and she slammed on the brakes and I flew into the front of the vehicle and I couldn't stop laughing. At that moment I knew we were going to be friends. I was a freshman so I didn't really know anyone and she was always nice to everyone so we started hanging out more. I lived about @NUM1 miles out of town and her brothers went to school about @NUM2 miles past my house so we had to go pick them up. We bought a game called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' and there are tons of little jellbeans that were flavored like vomit, centipede, dirt, rotten egg, etc.. So we were playing while we were driving out there and @CAPS3 had to stop the car nearly @NUM3 times in our @NUM4 mile drive! Those were the nastiest beans ever! Then, we would drive out to my house and we'd listen to our favorite country songs and blast them in her car. She was my ultimate best friend and no one could replace her. Whenever we would get in fights we wouldn't start drama, we'd always have an actual fight because by the time one of us were pinned the other was laughing too hard to do anything about it. Her dad and my dad became friends later on too and we would always have barbeque's and family get togethers.  We also talked in a @CAPS4 accent all the time because one of our friends was from @LOCATION1. Whenever we went to @CAPS5 to go shopping we'd use our accent and everywhere we went people would ask us where we were from. Before we knew it our dads started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang words and then the whole school started using them. She is a great friend and she keeps me laughing everyday. Whenever @PERSON1 was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and I would always be there for her. She always called me sister instead of @CAPS6 because we were so close. She used to take @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 classes at my old high school and when she got the fake baby doll it would keep us up late into the @TIME1, that baby was crazy. @PERSON1 would be driving and the baby would start screaming in its car seat and we'd have to pull over and find out what was wrong with it. She'd be a good mom. She always cared for things, even the smallest little thing she would cherish.  One time, we painted her little brothers room because we were bored and @PERSON1 was rolling her paintbrush in paint and texting and she took her eye off of her phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it for like @NUM5 minutes and by the time she did find it it was totally covered in green paint! I laughed at her for so long and those are the moments I wish I could bring back.  Everytime we hung out I would laugh and I realize now how important that laughter is to me. About six months ago I moved to a whole different state and I don't see her very often. There is no one like @PERSON1. She could make me laugh and was always just @NUM5 minutes away when I needed something, now I have to drive about @NUM2 hours to even see her. I haven't laughed like she made me ever since I went back to visit. Laughter is key, as I stated before and if you frown, you'll never know who is falling in love with your smile.

 A few years ago, when I was @NUM1, I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the color of the clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of @CAPS11, I did really @CAPS1 in school, and I also had a very 'up' attitude. @CAPS6 clothes were all very bright and 'happy' colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed, and the darker colored clothes they wore, would make their mood and attitude would dip. The experiment would last one week, and in that time I would try @CAPS7 to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I got to black, to see how I would be affected, if affected at all. To get started, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try @CAPS7 to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that i only had to wait for the @DATE2 to end and @DATE3 to begin. @DATE3 @TIME1 I woke up and did @CAPS6 usual daily routine, then tried on @CAPS6 new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised looks from @CAPS6 classmates @CAPS2 they took in @CAPS6 outfit. @CAPS11 was pretty tough @CAPS7 to laugh at some of their expressions but I couldn't, because that would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day, I got comments on @CAPS6 clothing, and some of @CAPS6 teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing @CAPS2 usual but when I told them of @CAPS6 experiment, they understood and said, "@CAPS1 luck." @CAPS2 the day came to an end, I was satisfied with @CAPS6 success and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if @CAPS6 theory would be proven wrong. But on @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS6 mom pointed out that I seemed different.  "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 okay?" she asked. "@CAPS4 don't seem @CAPS2 energetic @TIME1, and your @CAPS7 smiling at all. Your @CAPS7 sick @CAPS3 @CAPS4?" I told her that I was fine. At school, I was asked the same thing, and after a while @CAPS11 got really annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry and they forgave me, telling me @CAPS11 was probably just the experiment. I got a little happier at the thought that @CAPS6 theory might just be correct. That day went by slowly, and I was glad when @CAPS11 ended. @DATE4 was the last day of @CAPS6 experiment and for that I was happy. I didn't mind the dark clothes and I liked the way they looked on me, but @CAPS11 was hard @CAPS7 laughing, and @CAPS11 was starting to make me feel depressed. That day I decided to wear some of @CAPS6 bright clothes to see if @CAPS11 would change anything, and when I got to school some of @CAPS6 friends didn't recognize me because they got used to seeing me in @CAPS6 other clothes. I didn't feel any different from when I wore @CAPS6 dark clothes. In @CAPS5 I had to stand in front of the class to give @CAPS6 conclusion. "@CAPS6 theory has been proven semi-correct," I stated. "@CAPS7 laughing did have an effect on @CAPS6 mood and attitude. I was yelling at @CAPS6 friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But I found that wearing dark clothing didn't change anything." @CAPS6 teacher then said something so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone applauded and said, "@CAPS9 back @CAPS10!" @CAPS11 feels really @CAPS1 to laugh again.

     Laughing, laughter.It's every where. Lots of people are laughing right now.Why not laugh though? It's good for you right? It feels good to laugh here an their. Well laughter can make your day great. It can help you get through hard times. It can help you cheer up your best friend to be happy. Well it really don't matter what the reason is, but its good to laugh. Laughing is great for you an it brings fun, joy, an helps you enjoy little more. My mom and I have a great relationship. Every time we are together, or we start talking we will laugh an crack each other up. Laughing has helped us get to having a great relationship were we can tell each other anything. I can go to her any time an ask her for help. I can go an talk to her any time I need to now. Be for we had a great relationship she wasn't doing to good she was involved in not to good of things. She was very depressed too. Ill tell you a little about it.   My day started off as a normal school day, I got up got ready, got on thus to school then be for I new it I was on the bus on my way home. I get off a block or two away from my house and then I walk home. I walk and walk, an about ten minutes later I get up to my house. I go to my room an put my bags down on my bed and go say hi to my mom. I walk into her room an shes sitting their in a chair. I had asked her if she wanted to go on a walk. Well of course she said yes.She gets her shoes on an I do the same.We walk down are drive way an that's where the walk starts.        We started walking down the road after we got to the end of are drive way. We walked straight for about five minutes, then take a right.We walk that way for about ten minutes an turn left. Their is a little store on that coroner. We stopped their to buy some water an some snacks on the walk. After we get done we start walking east on the road. When I looked back at my mom she look like she was having a really bad day. Like anyone i asked her what was wrong. She talked to me about everything and she seemed really sad, and depressed. From that I knew i need to talk to her an make her laugh. We never had the best relationship because she was always gone hanging out with friends. I knew if i could make her laugh, an help her get better, it would help us get along better an help each other out in the long run. I love my mom an I hate seeing people down. I though all this in my head. Being around me makes everyone laugh.  The walk was about three to four miles long. for the rest of the time I got her to laugh an laugh the whole way back. It made her feel a lot better i know that. Later that day she came in my room and we played some bored games and watch a movie or two. We really just talked and hung out for the rest of the day. We went on a couple more walks for the next month or two and we got a good mother an son relationship. We were both happy this had happened. About two months from the first walk w had she came up to me and hugged me and told me thank you for helping her out with what she was going though. I think laughter is a great thing in life. For me it helped me out a lot in life an it helped me save a relationship with my mom. I love laughing, and I love making people laugh it is fun to laugh an fun to make people laugh. Laughter makes great friendships. It can have a lot to do with your life. I hope this helps you laugh more and makes you try to be funny an have people laugh with you.

 Laughter is just one of those things that doesn't go away very easy. The simplest things can make you laugh or smile the point is happiness is going to be around for a while. My dad laughs, my mom laughs I laugh everybody laughs its a good thing to have. If there was nothing on what to be happy on then people would be in fights and country's in wars. Anger is not something someone wants to deal with all the time; you have to relax every now and then.  My parents and I know that happiness is what drives us to good things. That's why we embrace it in our house we like to acknowledge it to my younger siblings. My dad and me have a good relationship as well with my mom we get along well and laugh together.  Me and my girlfriend @LOCATION1; we started out in a good relationship but as time went on it was starting to fade. We weren't communicating as well and that's what was driving us apart. We were just ending up in fights all the time and for no reason fighting just seemed to find us all the time. We talked we hung out and we started getting along better laughing at our joke or our constant teasing to one another. We had a good time she said that she liked us laughing and having a good time. I told her that laughing and enjoying ourselves is what brought us together. Laughing is the key to our happiness its what made me and her closer its a main key point to any relationship.  If there is no happiness then there is no laughter, and if there is no laughter then how are you suppose to get happiness. They work together and its a good thing to have in life where would we be if we didn't have it. We would all have a grudge and for no reason to have one and just live in black and white all the time.

 A few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat and it jumped about two feet into the air, Once again we started laughing really hard but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1 my dad my bother and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did. He flipped the switch and next thing i know i was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4-able to free himself from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues, i tried it first and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result to all these great funny times we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away , and @PERSON1 moved. In better words funny times @MONTH1 be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces.. 
<START>

A @ORGANIZATION1 is a wondrous gift. It allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others. It is the root of happiness, and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and by myself. I was empty. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I @MONTH1 be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me.  I was six years old when they got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't @CAPS1 living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think i was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my @CAPS1 had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't speak a word of @CAPS2. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh. Though he's not near me in a physical sense, I am guided by his laughter every day.

Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS4 went upstairs @CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step-brother was on @CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step-sister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @CAPS46 with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was going her word-search @CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS34 we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom said, "@CAPS1 me?" @CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called "@CAPS3." @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked over the list @CAPS2 suddenly said "@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy. Which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 I start laughing really hard @CAPS2 ask, "@CAPS7's @CAPS8?" I was saying it wrong @CAPS34 when @CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  "@CAPS7?" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed it to her. "@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13." @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 we started laughing. "That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say." I comment @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called "@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21" @CAPS22 were several things on @CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like, "I don't know." @CAPS2 then I asked her another. "@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know." @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word "ear" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS34 "earring" was. We ended up finding "hair" at the end of the "ear" I'd circled. "@CAPS26 thanks for that picture." @CAPS27 mom said. "@CAPS7? Ear-hair?" I asked @CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto "@CAPS29". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was "@CAPS30" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said "@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'" I said in a weird voice. "'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  "@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head." I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked in the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' @CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. "@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy." @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. "@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats." @CAPS4 managed to get out @CAPS2 I'm looking at her. "@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. "I don't know." @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then said good-bye @CAPS2 left. "@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills." I snorted at @CAPS7 @CAPS4 said. "@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills." @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. "@CAPS46 away." @CAPS4 said with a smile. "@CAPS48." I said before turning @CAPS2 walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS24 kind of had to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS49.

                  The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This @CAPS2 started out like any other @CAPS2. Me waking up thinking what am I going to do. So I walk out of my room, ask my mom if we have any plans. She says that we don't have any plans. So after I talked to her some more. I went back into my room and there I saw that I had gotten a text message from my @CAPS1 friend @PERSON3. He asked if I wanted hang out with him. I decided of course I can because I had no family plans. "I would love to hang out with you @PERSON3".  @PERSON3 and I met at the @NUM1 bus stop on royal and we went to @ORGANIZATION2. See now the reason why we went to @ORGANIZATION2 was because the @CAPS2 before I had gotten a gift card from my grandmother and fifty dollars from @CAPS4 (@CAPS4 is my biological father). When we finally got to @ORGANIZATION2 asked me what are we going to get here. I said anything I want. him start busting up laughing. I bot a jackass shirt and some food. From @ORGANIZATION2 we went to @CAPS6 @CAPS7 to get some delicious food.  When we walked into the restaurant, the aroma from the place made us drool a little bit. @PERSON3 got a big bowl and stuffed @CAPS15 with everything he could. We ate so much. I ganged like ten pounds. We talked about life and how awesome the food was. Where we were going next was still undecided. We finally finished our food. I payed for the to bowls of food and we went to our bus stop and went to downtown @PERSON1. While we were on the bus @PERSON3 decided that we shall go to @ORGANIZATION1.  So we got off the bus and what do you know my friends @CAPS8 boy, @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 were downtown chill en like a villain. @PERSON3 went and smoked a cigarette. While I went and checked the bus schedule for the @ORGANIZATION4 bus. Him and I had to wait for @NUM2 minutes. So we gust hung out with our friends. @CAPS9 is the funniest guy @CAPS3. I laughed until I started to cry. I almost pissed myself.  We left to go get on the bus, laughed some more. When we got to the @ORGANIZATION4 we had know idea why we even went there. So we just walked around. @PERSON3 decided that we should into the photo booth to make this @CAPS2 legit. I had a lot of fun getting our picture taken. Next place we went was @CAPS11-topic. I love that store. We were in there for @CAPS3.  About two or so hours pass.  At the @ORGANIZATION4 there is this park that you can go to but you have to cross the bridge to get to @CAPS15. @PERSON3 and I got bored and went on an epic adventure to this park. There was a couple trails that we walked. I tripped on a branch. @PERSON3 laughed at me. We found this piece of concrete. @PERSON3 and I put on some music and danced to @CAPS12 @CAPS13. I love @CAPS14 music its really fun to dance to. I had orange soda that @PERSON3 drank. I took a lot of pictures of him drinking the soda. We pretended that the grass was lava and the concrete was a place for break dancing in cave man days. I took a video of @PERSON3 dancing and laughing to the song @CAPS15's the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 by sponge bob. He also ate all of my chips that i bot at @ORGANIZATION2. After that we went back onto the trails and skipped through the tree's. I trow skittles at birds and old people. While telling them to taste the rainbow.  We finally realized that we needed to get back home so him and I started walking back to the bus stop. Missed the first bus the caught the next one. Hung out downtown for an hour. Chilled with my downtown friends at @NUM3 park. Got a donut from @ORGANIZATION3. That place is epicly bad ass! Got some intents from this cool store by the station.  As the @CAPS2 ended @PERSON3 and I went our separate ways home. Both still to this @CAPS2 saying that, "that @CAPS2 was epic".

 Human beings are...unusual...Okay, we're weird. There are so many people in the world, including ourselves, and the only way we can like ourselves is if we can get others to like us; if that isn't strange enough, we still don't like ourselves no matter who likes us. Just what are we thinking? We are always using relationships to assist our understanding of who we are; it's a gamble to even have those relationships. Face the facts, we risk so much on relying on others; we give them the ability to build us...or break us. Our major goals as youngsters is to find people to like us. I think it might even span to later times in life than that! From my experiences I know there are two key points in knowing a person can build us: trust and kindness. Finding builders with these traits is as easy as understanding if they bring you joy or not.  A person can give you joy by simply being kind to you...but if you want a whole swarm of friends, then this isn't exactly the best way. It's not that kindness is a bad way to make friends...it's just that it's not the fastest method. If a builder is kind then of course you would become their friend...in time; in order to immediately know a friend when you see one, they will make you laugh. Laughter makes us enjoy our time with our friends, it's a golden rule in the book of @CAPS1, if there is such a book. And it was through laughter that I made my experience in @CAPS2 class better. @CAPS2 class, to me, was extremely stressful. Every day we had either a speaking assignment or we had paperwork; and the class was really slow. Why was it slow? It was slow because we could hardly get through one set of instructions without some group speaking or finding some other way to disturb the class. A good example would be this one class project we had to do. As usual, instructions were slow; I was at my boiling point. Today seemed different though, despite the the usual annoyance, not a single student asked for a repeat on instructions, in fact, they all seemed to understand and immediately started working. I too followed in with this action. The assignment was, each group of about three to four people had to create a script using the vocabulary learned from the supplied booklet; it took a whole class period and then everyone went home to do their other work. The next day we returned to @CAPS2 was definitely an interesting one. The teacher had all kinds of strange props lined up for us. apparently we were going to have the audience act out our script, our job was to read it out loud. My group was first to entertain and we had finally selected our volunteers and actors. Tiffany, @PERSON1, and I sat down in the back of the classroom ready to read the script, not sure what the actors would deliver. Our play was... a success?! By the end of the first sentence everyone was giggling. As we moved further on to the next play the laughter had grew louder. Students were really enjoying themselves and more people volunteered to preform until it was difficult to choose actors. Even I, the classroom-snob, was enjoying myself. The plays were fun and random, some play would send everyone into hysterics. I can easily remember one of the groups making me laugh so hard that my sides were aching, tears lined my lids, and it was almost impossible to breathe. This project was definitely the best one I had ever participated in. It's moments like these when we build strong unity in the classroom, we enjoyed all of the people around us and we enjoyed ourselves. I was so use to being angery at my classmates that I was taken by suprise on that one day. Enjoying their plays so much, I now look at them as an entertaining group of students, rather that the annoyance I had seen them as before. No longer are these people strangers in the hallway, now they are family. It really is amazing how something as simple as laughter can change ones outlook on others and themselves.

                                  The @CAPS1 of Laughter  @CAPS2 would we be without laughter? Would we still have relationships/friendships like we do @CAPS5? Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  "@CAPS3 @PERSON5," I began, "@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top." "@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement. "@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!" @CAPS6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS17 camera.  We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. @CAPS12 was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS10 the mall?  "@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11," @CAPS12 screamed. "@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13, and @CAPS14're @CAPS9? He's never going to talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!"  "@CAPS14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS14 know it," chimed @PERSON2. "@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14 pretty good, huh?" "@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock," I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up @CAPS9, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS12 was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut @CAPS1 that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS14 have any experiences @CAPS2 laughter brought @CAPS14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?

 During the @CAPS1 break my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. "@CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  "I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!" @PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON4. @CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME1 when my @CAPS5 was still home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @PERSON2 and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in @LOCATION4. Just being in @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to be. Espicially when I'm with my friends and family.

                                  "Laughter" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good.

 A while back, I had a friend named @PERSON4. We were best friends; like two peas in a pod. We would hang out everyday, all day @DATE1.  One random day we walked up to our other friend @PERSON1's house to see if she could hang out. We all were hanging out all day when @PERSON1 came up with an idea. She wanted both me and @PERSON2 to stay the @TIME1.We stayed out a little past dark and just walked around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house so she could get her clothes then left to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. On our way there, we stopped, again, at @LOCATION2's house and chilled for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes just laughing @CAPS9 all the crazy stuff that has happened over @DATE1 already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, smacked @PERSON1 on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS3 kept talking @CAPS9 that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2.  When we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I directed him to where he was going and he said, "@CAPS6 you," and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON4 looked at me and screamed, "That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS7 seen!" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 the time we reached the @CAPS10 down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS8 this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her crap @CAPS9 it. That was the greatest @TIME1 of @DATE1.  We ended up going to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy some drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping we'd find it. Re-retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before We even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION3. So her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME1. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in.  It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS7 smelled. @CAPS8 no doubt was it the funnest @TIME1 I've had with that girl.

 Everyone laughs differently , some people laugh so hard that they cry, and some don't. But one thing that they have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy, or happiness, or even if something is just really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something for instance maybe you are having a bad day and then one of your friends comes up to you and tells you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, right? Having a good sense of humor is something that can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, or even like I said just a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and even something that you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing, it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it. Whenever I laugh I always feel better, laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of good times I have spent with friends and family, it reminds me of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years and that we can still laugh at just as hard as we used to. I believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger. When you laugh at things it creates long lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about them again in the future you will still think it is just as funny as before. Some of my best friends laugh at everything, they think that every little joke is the funniest ever, their laughs are unforgettable you can always hear them laughing. Which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy. If you believe that you are not a funny person, just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and most likely start laughing as well.  I enjoy getting to spend quality time with some of my closest friends, and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for the beginning of @DATE1 before going into high school. It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from middle school. We packed up my family's car and headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. Not even half-an-hour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on. We always create great memories and this one was already in the books for one of the best. I am sure that the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun, we sang songs and danced (as much as we could buckled down in a seat) to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours. Of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny. We made a boring moment fun. Once we finally got there we did not hesitate to drop off our bags and grab our bikes and take off and explore. The weather was so nice, not a cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school. The next day we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft, sounds like a fun idea. Well it would be if we actually knew where we were going, I used to do it all the time with my family so I had an idea of where to go, but still five girls two rafts and a river, maybe not such a good idea. During the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars. Knowing us we laughed the whole way down the river. Whenever we passed people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us by how much we were laughing and enjoying each others company. By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry good thing my mom had prepared us some lunch for when we got home, when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh. You know you have built a good friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other. All because of one little thing called laughter.

Laughter can be used for many things. One of which can be the important part of a relationship. There are many key parts in a relationship. But, the most important one is definitely the part of "laughter being the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS1 laughter can cure the emotion of being sad. @CAPS1 it doesn't cure it.   If laughter is the shortest distance between two people then if a guy or girl meets someone they like. For instance, I have went up to a girl before and couldn't figure out anything to do or say. So, I just tried my best to make her laugh. It @MONTH1 have taken a few days of trying really hard to do so. But, in the the end, i was more comfortable asking her out and feeling more comfortable around her and her friends. @CAPS3 I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because it is never a good thing to see her in a bad mood. Now on some occasions I have made people laugh and it not mean anything. But, @CAPS3 I make my girl laugh then it was totally worth it. Because I can cheer her up from being any kind of sad or angry to making her happy and full of laughter. It @CAPS1 helps with being depressed too. Her being depressed is kinda like a train wrecking off its tracks. It never turns out good. But @CAPS3 she is happy, she can be full of joy, all giddy, and @CAPS1 very spontaneous.  I know @CAPS1 being alone and laughing is good. But you can @CAPS1 get called crazy if you are laughing at nothing at all. The best way to know someone is possibly feeling better is laughter. If they laugh then they can't be mad, sad, or any kind of emotion besides happy, or maybe sarcasm. But sarcasm can be blown off like it is nothing. If I ever try sarcasm to make people laugh I always end up offending them. So I always just be myself around everyone I come around.  So if you ever hear that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. You should know that it is true. Because not only do you get to a lot more place and get to know someone more. But, you can also learn valuable things about life through being closer to more people. @CAPS3 you hear that phrase, ask yourself, "@CAPS2 I capable of making someone laugh? @CAPS2 I able to pull off laughter and actually be close to someone?" @CAPS3 you do that, you'll know that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.

 Each person filed in, one after the other, making a human train. The metallic red bell chimed once as each person pushed the door slightly more open. Walking in, I was enveloped by the smell of @CAPS1 food and conversations that hummed in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. To the right was a wall covered in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 symbols and meanings, while to the left were hundreds of tables already filled. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom. I so badly wanted to plop myself down at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there silently. With moms knowing what's best, she shoved me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did as she told me, like always, but made my reluctance clear. Walking over to the table with the speed of a slug and my feet dragging on the floor, I awkwardly stood in front of the circular table. Yanking out one of the chairs, I turned to my mom with a pleading look as desperation filled every fiber of my body, for I knew there was no way she would give in. Staring at these six relatives, I didn't know how I could manage to sit here the rest of the evening.  We had all gathered at a @CAPS1 restaurant for my grandpa's @NUM1 birthday. Each of his children had flown from the mainland to @LOCATION1 in order to spend this special moment with him. I hadn't seen these cousins for over @NUM2 years, and some much longer. I had already visited with them since we'd been in @LOCATION1, but I hadn't talked to them much, none the less when we were all together and forced to mingle.  With my napkin on my lap, I sat and looked at my cousins, each one staring back at me like I was an animal at the zoo. After a moment or two, they seemed to forget I was there because they averted their gaze and began talking amongst themselves. The only person at the table who I didn't feel like a complete stranger towards was my cousin, @PERSON2. She had wavy brown hair with blindingly blond highlights, sun-kissed from those bright tropical days, along with that brown @CAPS6 skin that made me jealous. We began talking, and soon I found myself enjoying the moment.  It wasn't until the food came that we actually began interacting as a group. Being teenagers with bland palates, everyone stared as the waiter brought the first dish. After asking the friendly waitress what it was we were about to eat, from her broken @CAPS7 we deciphered that they were buns with duck inside. Frantically trying to get all of the tables served in fairly constant intervals, she left our table and all of us looked at our food blankly. No one wanted to take the first bite. One of my cousins, @PERSON1, stepped up to take the masculine role as the dare devil. We all waited tentatively as he chomped down on the moist bun and swallowed. Once done chewing, he smiled and it seemed this dish had won his approval. Digging into my buns, I began to wonder if maybe these people were easy to relate to and I had made a small thing into a big ordea. From then on, I would just be myself and stop worrying about not having seen anybody for years; All I needed was to be myself.  The way the courses were set up left plenty of time to chat between each plate they brought. Since I was no longer worrying about what to say or how to say it, I easily fit into the conversations and began to relax. Shortly after the duck tray was removed from the table, it was discovered that my cousin @PERSON1, who is from @LOCATION2, pronounces certain words with an accent. Soon everybody began comparing the way we pronounce things to the way that he does. After each difference we found, we would chuckle. Things carried on like that for the rest of the @TIME1, everyone laughing at things that were only moderately funny, but we found hilarious.  It was that @TIME1 when I realized, even though you @MONTH1 be uncomfortable around a group of people who you don't know very well, finding a common ground helps you to ease that discomfort. Finding something that you all enjoy talking about @MONTH1 be hard to do, but finding something that makes you laugh is a lot easier. Laughter is something that everyone enjoys and can take part in even if they're not contributing to the conversation. By feeling as though you're a part of what's going on, you feel accepted, and that's all anyone ever wants.

 People say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A @ORGANIZATION1 I saw @CAPS6 to be true was when I met a girl named @PERSON1. Three years ago I was at a city @CAPS10 swinging, wondering if it would hurt if I jumped. I took @CAPS15 chances and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air , noticing the unbalanced feeling of falling in @CAPS15 chest, everything slowing down, the temptation of what will happen when I hit the ground was vast. Sticking the landing was a fail and getting up from it wasn't much of a success either, until I felt hands upon @CAPS15 shoulder and arm. I looked up at @CAPS15 helper and saw a girl. Not @CAPS5 a girl but a gorgeous girl. A girl with green dazzling eyes that can stop an angry rhino charging toward her, hair the flowed with the wind, soft, gentle skin that would make you think that @CAPS11 could be hurt for how soft it was."@CAPS1." Was all I could squeeze out."@CAPS1, are you okay?" @CAPS3 asked with a very concerned tone."@CAPS4 I'm fine, @CAPS5 forgot to stick the landing. Thanks for helping me, um whats your name?" I returned with a @NUM1, and your welcome. whats your name?" @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 giggled before @CAPS3 said her name."@CAPS7, do you want to walk around with me?" I struggled to vocalize."@CAPS8, but I have to @CAPS9 at the @CAPS10 because @CAPS15 mom will be here soon." @PERSON1 stated. during the walk around the @CAPS10 we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random question's that the other person had to answer. I figured out that @CAPS3 was @NUM2 years old, her favorite color was baby blue and @CAPS3 always wanted to be a doctor. we walked around the playground some more @CAPS5 talking about past memories or something that happened to each other in the past. I asked her if @CAPS3 had a brother and sister. her response was that @CAPS3 does have a brother, and two sisters. While I was listening to her I noticed @CAPS3 was very deep into thought and asked what @CAPS3 was thinking about and @CAPS3 quickly replied. "@CAPS11, @CAPS5 wondering why I'm so happy with you.""well it could be that I'm making you feel good by laughter. Or it could be @CAPS15 charms working on you." I replied with a @CAPS12 accent."@CAPS13 @CAPS4 its definitely that." @CAPS3 barely got out the words cause of laughter. Suddenly there was a car horn honking and we said our goodbye's and @CAPS3 left. I sat there watching the car go down the road and was hoping that we @MONTH1 see each other again, but in a way I knew we wouldnt because @CAPS15 mom, and I were moving from the city to a small town half way across the country. Turning around and walking back toward @CAPS15 house for the last night in the city all I could think about was her and how a little bit of laughter became the @CAPS16 to friendship.

 When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE3, nor was it on a crazy @DATE4 break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE1 I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE4. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE2 I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS4 that @DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks. And as of a @DATE1 @TIME1, that has made all the difference.
<START>

 Moving around from place to place was always hard, I hated the thought of never seeing any friends or family. Never was the only word I could hold on to, there was no point in hope it was a futile feeling. I knew I would dearly miss @LOCATION1, and @ORGANIZATION1 just sounded so far; a twelve hour drive seemed like the edge of the earth to me. I visited @ORGANIZATION1 before, it was boring to tell the truth, and on top of that looking for a new house would bore me furthermore, all I could think about was @LOCATION1. Now I was moving there! When I first heard about the move I was infuriated and tried to fight against this poor decision, I was sure that my parents were making a mistake. As hard as I fought I could not win, my tears coulden't move my parents in the slightest way even In my greatest efforts, I was broken and confined to the moving van for twelve hours but to me it felt like forever. Finally my departure was over and my legs were sore and tired, I didn't want to manouver out of my seat or even touch @ORGANIZATION1's soil. The ground was dirty and tainted and the apartment complex was old and overly occupied, the rain and mud didn't help my attitude much either. Everything about this place was digusting and the thought of still sharing a room with my younger brother made me feel sick to my stomach. I stepped foot out side and entered my apartment and went straight to my bleakly colored room. I sat down and collected my thoughts trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation. The walls were caving in on me and they seemed to take the shape of bars, I was condemed to this fait that I could not escape untill I turned @NUM1, and that was more than @NUM2 years away! I was stuck in my apartment for three days before I wandered outside, but it wasn't all that horrible concidering it was raining all the time even at the end of the @DATE2 which was abnormal for me. I didn't want to leave my room or my apartment, all I wanted to do is watch @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons in my room. I felt alone and out of place I had no friends to talk to, my parents wouldent listen to me, and my little brother was only @NUM3 so he wouldent understand. There were no more smiles when I found out that I had to go to school the next day. Aloha park sounded like some school that would have great funding and spoiled rich kids in it but it was actually the exact opposite. It was an older school with kids that mostly lived in lower income housing at the time. In someways it was rather comforting knowing that I lived the same way temporarily. The first day of school was frightening, it was my first major transition into a new unfamilliar place. My teacher was old and grouchy, she seemed to have a major chip on her shoulder. Suddenly, out of the blue she held my hand in the hallway which was humilliating and definately not comforting. I heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me I thought I would never make any friends. The humiliation was withstandable but the thought of being in this class for the next nine months was a fear beyond belief. My teacher told me to take a seat on the far side of the room next to three boys, they all had the same expression which was an amalgamation of both alienated confusion and territorial pride. The feeling of being unwelcome would be an understament of the new nervous sensation that had surrounded me. I sat down unaware of the actions that the three boys might deal on to me, surprisingly the only occurence was a series of temporary stares and an aquard silence.  As the day continued life had again had become somewhat casual, until the boys had started to talk about the opposite gender and my attention was directly turned towards them. I sat there and quietly listened and smirked at the inapropriate conversation that I was clearly not supposed to be a part of. They laughed and snickerd and covered their mouths embarassingly, as I looked at them and concidered them amatures of the comical arts. I wanted to say something that I held onto for the whole conversation and then I took my chances to add a most important joke and quickly I muttered my overly inapropriate sentence. They confusingly looked at me and asked me what I had said, I wasnt sure how they would take the joke but I risked another chance and repeated it. The group of boys grew silent and the only noises were those of the other students talking to eachother, suddenly they bursted out laughing. I was overjoyed that they had a sense of humor, and after that I had friends and @CAPS1.

                 Laughter at its @CAPS1  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people," or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS1 they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH1 actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON1 and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often.

 It was @DATE1 seventh and I had invited my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, to go to my boyfriend's football game with me. It would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a different high school than we did. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my @CAPS3 would take us to his game later. When we arrived at the end of the lane we started walking up to my house. Then all of the sudden "ahhhhhh, @CAPS1 my god!" @PERSON2 and I were both screaming at the top of our lungs, "@CAPS2 a... ahhhh!". @PERSON2 and I had almost stepped on a dead snake that was laying in the lane. While this was going on @PERSON1 had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked back at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing. She soon figured out that we had been startled by the snake and also started in "you guys are so funny @CAPS2 just a dead snake". We talked and laughed our way up to my house. @CAPS4 we had caught up a little and I had changed into my boyfriends #@NUM1 jersey, we went downstairs to eat. We sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started eating. My @CAPS3 came over and put her bowl down then went back into the kitchen to get something. When she came back she had napkins and another bowl, I playfully ask her "are you really hungry @CAPS3?" she said "no..uh why?" That's when the girls and I started laughing hysterically again, "@CAPS3 you have two bowls you are obviously very hungry" I giggled. She turned a little red and then said back "well I do love chili, I can't ever seem to get enough of it" then she laughed a little "your probably right I should just start with one bowl."  @CAPS4 we gathered the blankets for the stands we left. On our way up we made a pit stop at the famous @ORGANIZATION1. I was so exited to see my boyfriend and to have my friends come along that coffee was probably not the best idea, but we stopped anyway. While we were in there waiting for our coffee we passed the time by making faces through the nearby window at people who happened to drive by. We were cracking up over the looks people gave us, some looked like @CAPS5 thought it was funny while others looked like @CAPS5 thought we had escaped from a nut house. Soon enough our drinks were ready and we headed out the door. Then as we were walking to the car some guy whistled at us. We hopped in the car and then lost it when we saw that it was some guy who was dressed up in one of those statue of liberty costumes.  We were almost at the school and I was bouncy from the caffeine and excitement mix. My @CAPS3 had never driven to @PERSON3's school before, while my dad had only was busy that night. I was trying to keep calm while giving her directions in a very giggly manner. I started off by saying "you go straight up here @CAPS3" the my @CAPS3 and the girls said "honey you can't go straight up here". "yes you can" I argued then @CAPS4 a while @PERSON1 said "girl look you could go straight but you ain't gonna see @PERSON3 if you do". I realized @CAPS5 were right and told my @CAPS3 "don't turn, just turn right" she got confused cause I had said the directions wrong so she turned left. I started to freak, screaming "no no no! we have to turn around I meant right" @CAPS5 all burst out laughing at me "man calm down woman, we just have to turn around" said @PERSON2. We finally got back on track and I tried to give clear directions. I wasn't completely positive where the turn off was for his school so I told my @CAPS3 to go slow, when we passed it and I freaked out again. "@CAPS1 @CAPS3 we have to turn around" @CAPS5 all laughed at this and then my @CAPS3 said that she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and hopped out to pay and get in. We got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room. I got another dose of excitement, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started to walk away so I could wave at @PERSON3. I pulled on their shirts and begged them to stay because I didn't want to be the only person waiting. Then I saw him run past and before I knew it I leaped off the ground and waved frantically. I saw him smiling as he ran onto the field, my friends laughed at how I jumped and we enjoyed the game.

                                Outdoor @CAPS1 In sixth grade I went to outdoor @CAPS1 I got up really early and went to @CAPS1 where the bus is taking students to outdoor @CAPS1. First, of all I board on the way to outdoor @CAPS1. Then they told us in which cabin we were suppose to be I had seven cabin members including myself. I brought my electronic device but the teachers told us that we couldn't bring no devices to the trip. The next day we did some activities first we ate lunch before doing any activities. The foods that we ate were pizza, pizza pockets, and hot dogs then the activities that we did were catch some fishes and put them back to the water we were just examine them the other activities that we did was hike the mountains on the way we saw deers they were eating grass I got really tired then when we came back we were getting ready to go home. Finally I would want to help out and I really enjoyed my field trip.

                              The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When im with my family, we all have such a great time together that we laugh all the time at things or memories we say we remember. While we are all gathered around the table whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner we always have something fun to say and laugh about all the time. To begin with, during breakfast @DATE2 @TIME1, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME1, but suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a banana lying on the floor, when her manager went by she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall. It was impossible not to laugh about it becuase it was the manager. Well that @TIME1 was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said "@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happend, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and coutches trying to get dried off" I couldn't believe it and I starting laughing so hard that I had to tell my freinds that were next to me and them too starting laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school, but even though it was something good to laugh at I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told eachother about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his freinds were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of tiolet paper stuck to his pants. I immediatley thought he would have gotten embarrased but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying their cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldnt be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE1 third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enojoyed and had fun laughing with eachother telling about funny things that happen to us during our day.

                          Laughing is the key of happiness. Is a moment that is remember by many people. You share many laughs with friends, family and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and it could build a strong relationship. For me laughing means a lot, i laugh everyday. I will not forget the time when i was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem. One night me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could still fix them that there was a solution. He was calling me a liar, and more anger kept on building up. He was so hard headed and I couldn't get through his thoughts. He was saying that i could not fixed what i have done: whats done is done. I was getting really mad, I wanted him to go away and i thought i was not ever going to talk to him. We had a lack of trust and i just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would have got more mad and we were gonna end up screaming at each other. It got me so mad that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me, and he was disappointed. I got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was all ways telling jokes and teasing everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he would get me in trouble, it would end up with a joke at the end. The jokes he made when i was sad or mad would build our relationship stronger; we would always end up laughing. Later the night we were with all my family cutting my niece's cake and me and my dad were not talking. As we were singing happy birthday i would glare at him and look down. He was looking at me as if he was all tough. Then we were all saying "-í@CAPS1 le sople!", which means blow out the candles in @CAPS2. All of the sudden my uncle blows out the candle on accident and me and my dad stared at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying of laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It felt great laughing at the same thing and sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger. My dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was. It was only me and him who stayed laughing, everyone else giggled. As it was making my dad and my relationship better it build a connection between my family and I. Its a memory that's gonna last a life time, yet it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Although he was still upset about my grades it was all better. There was a connection between us and we could still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was about the night that i found the incident so funny. As it was making my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter it was all build up on the memory. Something me and him both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was as if it was not important, as if laughing made you change and helped us put it aside. Every laughing moment we have now is something me and him share, its now a connection. We both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger. Telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning. When you know you're happy is when you have a sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment when you made laughing an important part of your pass. When all those funny moments become important because that's when you showed you were happy. Its even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment. I know at times i will have moments where i am not laughing, but the key is to always look at the bright side. Even though me and my dad were mad at each other its a memory that will carry on with me forever.

 @CAPS8 families @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 was one of exploration, but also one in which we came to regret our move from @LOCATION3 a little. We missed our friends, our connections, but also places. The place @CAPS8 brother and I came to miss second only to our farm was a @CAPS3 we had dubbed "The @CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3." The place itself was a dump. Close to a dairy farm, it reeked of cow pats mixed with cigarettes. I remember that the grass was perpetually dry, and the bridge crossing the @CAPS3 was continually squeaking; it was an old, covered bridge, and on its last leg. So, it wasn't so much the place we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. On one particularly mopey day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying that we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. We knew about @CAPS4's adventures; we called them "@CAPS4-ventures" because they were truly one of a kind. Most of the time, we ended up miles away from any civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of "@CAPS4-ventures." @CAPS7, our mother was able to rouse @CAPS8 brother and I, and we were soon hustled into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. While @CAPS8 brother and I were in the back of the car, pining for our nice, comfortable rooms, @CAPS8 father had the audacity to laugh along to the radio, and open the windows of the car to our protests. Riding with @CAPS8 brother and I in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes, and could be used to drift down the @CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at a place called "@LOCATION2 bend." @CAPS8 brother and I jumped out of the car, and were met with pristine beauty. Covered in shade, the @CAPS3 flowed noisily, and we could hear it although we were not that close to the @CAPS3 bank. The grass was green and velvety beneath our feet, and the smell of fresh water welling up from the earth was delicious. The light filtered down through the trees and had a crystalline effect on the water. @CAPS8 brother and I hurriedly dressed into our swimsuits, while @CAPS8 father began to cart our food and supplies down the the @CAPS3 bank where we would be spending the day. As soon as we finished dressing, @CAPS8 brother and I chased after him, for the day was warm and the water looked good and cool. When our hunger had been sated, it was time to pull out the inner tubes. The water was nice and fast, with some white water and a very little water fall at the end. Being a rather petite child for @CAPS8 age, even these small obstacles looked like the most insidious of rapids, and they made @CAPS8 eyes widen a little. @CAPS7, I managed to steady myself, and prepared to get wet. At @DATE1, I hung on to @CAPS8 inner tube with clutched fingers and wild eyes, but gradually, I relaxed. I let @CAPS8 hand drift out to causally trail behind me in the water, drawing circles as the sunlight filtered down through the trees. As the water grew faster, I began to feel apprehensive again. I drew sharp, quick breaths as the little waterfall approached me. In reality, it was only about four feet tall, but in @CAPS8 panicked haze, those four feet looked like twelve feet. The white water was suddenly upon me, accompanied by a large and frightful shriek I gave. Somehow, I managed to stay afloat, and @CAPS8 ride left me smiling. I broke into long peals of laughter, laughing away all @CAPS8 homesickness and heartsickness. @CAPS8 brother came down the waterfall, spluttering and giggling, and we laughed together. Our laughter healed us, and for the @DATE1 time since the move, we felt totally and completely at home.

        Falling in love, @CAPS3 @CAPS1 The falling part was easy, I remember the minute I fell in love with you. Everything about you shined, everything about you sparkled. You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, @CAPS4 when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, "@CAPS2 have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before." That, @CAPS2 they saw in me was the power of love. @CAPS4 something they did not see was @CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 one of us would do something @CAPS3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from @CAPS1 so hard. that is @CAPS2 I love, I grew to love every part of you. Especially your laugh.  From @CAPS2 i hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to agree. Being able to laugh with someone, @CAPS3 being able to be yourself @CAPS3 not have to hold up this front, its magical. Its something that makes a relationship last. I guess its kinda like glue in sense. My brother @CAPS3 i are the closest you can get to best friends, @CAPS3 guess @CAPS2 we do in our spare time? We laugh. Hes someone that i can be silly @CAPS3 dumb @CAPS3 goofy with @CAPS3 he still laughs, @CAPS3 he still loves me. :) @CAPS4, although he is my brother it still holds the same respect, @CAPS1 is great. It is also a stress reliever. My teacher told me so. My health teacher that is.

    Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether the person is a relative, friend, or someone you are dating. Laughter makes you forget your worries and problems. But with a friendship based on laughter, when do you trade in the giggles for seriousness? I believe laughter is vital in a friendship. But to have a strong, healthy, relationship you also need a level of seriousness. This is the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships.    Olivia has been my best friend as long as I could remember, hanging out we laughed constantly. Laughter has always been a huge part of our friendship and always will be. But going into middle school we faced drama, boys and arguments, which we never experienced with one another. All of these small but important things to us then added up and began to make us drift apart. Our lack of sharing our feelings and instead cover it up with laughs caused us to bottle up anger towards each other. I always thought we were perfect matches for best friends because our countless inside jokes and the constant fun we would have. But our anger grew until we were ready to handle it, which we did not understand then.   We started to hang out less and less, and our daily calls became weekly. Both of us noticed a change in our friendship, but didn't know how to fix it, we apologized for fighting with each other and sympathized for our boy troubles but it wasn't the same. I missed her but the longer it went on the easier it was to not talk or hang out. Summer came around and our moms planned me to stay a week at her house while my parents were on vacation. To put it nicely I was less than thrilled, how was I suppose to stay a week there when we barely talk anymore? I knew everything would be okay but I still worried that the week would be constant fighting instead of laughs.    Finally the day came and my parents were driving me to her house. As I got there things were fine, we pretended nothing was going on and had fun, it was that way for a few days. But on the third day she broke the ice, asking what was wrong and why we don't talk anymore. That day something amazing happened, we talked about all our feelings and what was upsetting us. It was a little awkward at first but we got through it together. The fights got less and less because we knew the things that bugged each other, and everything slowly became better than it was before. That talk changed our relationship forever and I'm so glad she had spoken up when I didn't or else we wouldn't be as close as we are today.    That day was @DATE1, but had a huge impact on our friendship.Ever since we got that mile stone in our friendship I knew better how to be more open with other people also. Olivia has taught me so much but this was among the more important lesson. Laughter is a huge part of any strong relationship but you also need to be able to share your feelings and be serious. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with and I am grateful to have mine stick with me no matter what.

 Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last @DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small @CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our @ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. @CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. @CAPS8 opened the hearts of the @CAPS5 children so that they @MONTH1 hear the word of @CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, "I can go down the biggest hill" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON1 was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, "@CAPS9". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is "@PERSON2". Apparently, @PERSON2's friends spotted @PERSON1 first and told @PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know @CAPS2 @MONTH1 hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects @CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like "The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter" would we?

 Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON1 did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin @PERSON1 turns to me and says "you want to do something really fun." @CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when @PERSON1 informed me that he brought an @NUM1 firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter.

 Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS9 boundary.  @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS4 I don't see @CAPS8 than @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS5 could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE1 to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE1 to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. "@CAPS1," @CAPS5 said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. "@CAPS2," I began, "I believe @CAPS10 are a very good artist. Do @CAPS10 have any other pictures?" "@CAPS1," @CAPS5 said again, "however, they are all at home." "Is there any possible way that I @MONTH1 be able to see these other pictures of your's?" I said happily. "@CAPS4 @CAPS10 would like, @CAPS10 are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them." @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. "I would be honored," I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS8 lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE1. When the school @DATE1 came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS2, because I knew that @CAPS5 was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, "is that @CAPS10 sweetie?" "@CAPS1 mother," @CAPS5 said back, "I have a friend over." "@CAPS7!" @CAPS8 mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I have ever drawn a picture before. "@CAPS9," I said, "I am what @CAPS10 call challenged in the world of art." We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. "@CAPS10're clouds look like potatoes," @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS10 laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh.

 "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people," @CAPS3 quote can be agreed by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @CAPS1 with a person you care about. @CAPS1 is something you and another person can do together with ease. @CAPS3 brings two people closer together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing isn't going to be the main part of @CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept on rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for that perfect guy. In the @DATE2 I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times I realized that I started to have feelings for @CAPS3 boy. Whenever we talked he always had me @CAPS1. I found @CAPS3 very attractive. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @DATE1 there was a football game, @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools who are rivals). During @CAPS3 time him and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so we could watch the game together. I had previously told him how I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the track, @CAPS2 all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear "I would never let you @DATE3." I turned cherry red. From that day on he will remember me as the clumpsy girl who trips all the time. Now that i look back at the day I realize how funny that memory was. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a good thing in a relationship.  @CAPS2 you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life together you have to make sure you like them for whom they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and crack some jokes around. I always tell my friends "@CAPS1 is a great ab workout." Which is true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends, and laugh about random stuff is always something I look forward to. If there is no @CAPS1 going on, then that means I'm not having a good time. But lucky me, I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm around them there is never a moment @CAPS2 I'm not @CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person.  @CAPS2 you meet a new person, would you rather have awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we have the same answer, because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS3 person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking "@CAPS2 will I be able to leave?" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone would want to go through, I can say @CAPS3 from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at saying jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments and thats my way I have people @CAPS1. I don't get mad about it, I'm the total opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumpsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can bring a smile to a persons face, then I'm @PERCENT1 fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 they are down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own ways. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy gets a girl to laugh, that's the first sign @CAPS3 guy was meant for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means that you are having a good time. @CAPS1 brings people together. @CAPS1 can brighten a persons life. So next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice.

 My mom always say laughter is the greatist medican and it is true for me anyways. When ever I got sick or hurt I will allways laugh at a great joke and it made me feel a little better when ever my family go on a long trip we always made jokes and tease each other soon the trip dont seem that long at all. it's very short and you wish that it could of been longer. One night me and my family was going home from the store and my brother asked "what are we having for dinner tonight" "hambugers" she told us my brother kind of freaked out becouse we dont got @ORGANIZATION1's and my mom said all well and my dad then was in a smal store called @CAPS1 hopped in the car and started to drive home. "I feel like having mexican food tonight can we eat at @ORGANIZATION2's tonight" my mom asked "no I thought we were having hambugers tonight" he answered "We have no @ORGANIZATION1's" my mom laughed. Then my dad stopped the car and turned around "why" we all asked "we don't got @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 has some chips at least" then we all started bursting out laughing. Once we got ot the place and found a place to sit we were all talking and my sister bursted out " look dad I can move the straw from just looking at it" and she stared at the straw in the cup and everyone whent silent. I knew that it wouldn't move so I tapped the straw so it can move "ha look it moved" she was laughing knowing that she did not move the straw. my mom was trying to hold the laugh becouse my dad for a second thought she could move the straw for just looking at it. "I can't believe I fell for that" we finished up are meal and went home laughing and joking all the way.   Laughter can bring people together family, friends, even enymeys sometimes I laugh so hard that I could not breath so well. laughter bring fun in life and knowing that some other people have the same intrests and you @MONTH1 gain a friend you never know just like my family and the @LOCATION1's trip everyone laughs. When it snowed one day I graved my cell phone and gathered the neighbors and my brother and sister and went to the park together we had this idea to have a snow ball fight mixed with capture the flag. We all picked our bases and the type of flag that we want and then started the game we had fun playing we were laughing so hard that it hurt and soon before I relized it I was geting to know my nieghbor better after that day we talked to each other more and understood each other more the next time we have a snow ball fight I hope she is on my team and we will win for sure.

 My cousin @PERSON1 and I are constantly sick with laughter, he is the funniest person I know. He is hilarious when he isn't trying to be. I believe that is why he is so @NUM1king funny. @PERSON1 is a hardcore alcoholic, he is always drunk or drinking. On the rare occasion that he is doing neither of those two options, he is the dullest, most depressed, angry unfunny man around. Give him a drink or two and watch him turn into funtime @CAPS1. @PERSON1 and I have great grand wonderous times when there is an alcoholic beverage in or near his hands. @CAPS5 is sort of an awe inspiring thing to see this transformation take place. He starts as this sad, depressed, sober caged sociopath lion at the zoo with so many of society's judgemental, sour souled, pittiful excuses for men and women pointing, laughing and sobbing over this poor lion. When one of these "people" throw a beer his way he'll catch @CAPS5 in his fierce, angry teeth and devour a @NUM2 oz tallboy of @CAPS2 in mere seconds-- can and all! He then stands up on his gigantic feline paws and let out an amazingly deep vibrato of a purr. His big, ferocious cat teeth then smile like a @LOCATION1 lion, as his sick, beastly, blood stained fur slowly morphs into the scaley, scarred skin of a man. As he is standing there with a goofy idiotic sh!t eating grin he shouts "I @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @PERSON1!!" @CAPS5 really is an amazing thing, I have seen @CAPS5 so many times and I absolutely @CAPS6 find a single word to desribe this marvelous reconstruction of a living creature. Then with drinks in hand we will continue to have a great night of unknown comical amusements. I guess you could say laughter is a large part of our relationship.

 One day my friends and I went to a friends house and we started playing @CAPS1 box we were laughing having an awesome time. My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk at that time and @CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose, that was also funny but gross at the same time. @CAPS6 was the sad one of the whole group that was there, we all asked him, @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 so sad @CAPS5 answered that @CAPS5 heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said that @CAPS5 would think about it @CAPS6 was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that @CAPS5 left and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS7's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. So an hour past and my friend @CAPS6 came back. @CAPS5 came and sat with us and yelled I didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, @CAPS9 happened I asked?. @CAPS5 said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly. Oh did she really say silly that's not I word i thought she knew, everyone laughed, no @CAPS6 I was just messing with you man don't get mad come on now. So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me, @CAPS5 left and all of us guys started laughing I thought that @CAPS5 was just but hurt and @CAPS5 would get over it. an hour past and my phone starts ringing and I look who's calling and it @CAPS6 s ex girlfriend. Surprised I answer and I tell her that @CAPS6 wasn't with us that I would tell him to call you later, I said that because @CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to me so I was like okay so we started talking and she is telling me that she likes me... I start cracking up in laughter. She got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing. But I told that it was cool that she did so I told her I have to go and we hanged up... I couldn't help my self i started cracking up again and so that's how my day ended in laughter and it was like that all day

 Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. The implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends. It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. I personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my father's side of the family. One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time. Laughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my father's entire family, and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it. Being that they are scattered across @LOCATION2, and very few live in the vicinity of @LOCATION1, visiting with these family members is a rare occasion. The most admirable quality of my father's side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well. Just @DATE1 my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in @DATE2. This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members. Not only was I to be the only guy there, but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year. Although we had always enjoyed eachother's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities. The day of my sister's baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat. Within ten minutes of doing so, my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. However nervous I had been, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower. For the duration of the party, all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts, or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically. on this specific day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt.

                     LaughterLaughter can change a lot in people,it can bring people together. It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS2 your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and I. @CAPS2 your in a relationship or a friendship, @CAPS1 able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@CAPS2 you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that's even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  My best friend and I laugh all the time, @CAPS3 can just look at me in a way I only understand and I'll know what @CAPS3 means, and then we both start laughing @CAPS2 we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don't get it. My best friend and I are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship as in having a "boyfriend" or "girlfriend" one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @CAPS2 you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad @CAPS2 they want to hang out with there friends.  The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it's nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends, cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. Normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did that once and @CAPS3 was not happy as all in the relationship,@CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything,@CAPS3 was afraid to break up with him though cause @CAPS3 would not have any friends,cause @CAPS3 made him her life.  Laughter can always make you feel better, it'd kinda like a healing process it will always be there, its just a matter if someone can make you laugh.

 The @CAPS1 @CAPS2     I was sitting in the living room with @CAPS3 family talking about how every @ORGANIZATION1 we always end up laughing. One @ORGANIZATION1 we were out at @CAPS3 great grandpas house, and we just got done opening our presents, and in the middle of the floor was a @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 cousin @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was inside the @CAPS2.   At first we tried to convince @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was out side talking to @CAPS3 uncle. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't believe us, even though @CAPS3 dad was outside talking. @ORGANIZATION2 circled the @CAPS2, and observed the @CAPS2 and was convinced @CAPS3 dad was in it.  Then @ORGANIZATION2 started poking the @CAPS2. We were laughing because it was so cute that @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was in the @CAPS2. He kept saying "I know he is in there." @ORGANIZATION2 opened the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad was not in there. @CAPS3 dad walked in to the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started laughing too. Later on in the @TIME1 @ORGANIZATION2 was playing in the other room and wanted to show @CAPS3 dad the toy he was playing with. So @CAPS3 dad climbed in the @CAPS2 and we told @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was outside. @ORGANIZATION2 went outside to look for him but @CAPS3 dad wasn't there.   When @ORGANIZATION2 came inside he looked in every room and could not find @CAPS3 dad. After a while @ORGANIZATION2 was standing by the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad jumped out and scared @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 screamed like a little girl and we all laughed really hard.   @ORGANIZATION2 was mad at first then he started laughing too. At the time @ORGANIZATION2 was only five so when @CAPS3 dad jumped out at him he got really scared. @ORGANIZATION2 thought it would be funny to scare @CAPS3 dad so @ORGANIZATION2 hid in the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad came inside and we told @CAPS3 dad to look for @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3 dad called his name looked in every room and pretended like he couldn't find @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing because @CAPS3 dad acted like he was going to sit on @ORGANIZATION2 and it made him laugh super hard. When @ORGANIZATION2 got out of the @CAPS2 he was like "how did you know I was in the @CAPS2?" @CAPS3 dad said "well you started laughing silly goose."   out of all the @ORGANIZATION1's i have had that @ORGANIZATION1 was the best @ORGANIZATION1 ever. That was the time laughter brought two people together.

  While you being to make any kinda of relationship with anyone, you are usually going to start off making jokes and being silly. Whether your trying to be flirty with them, or just be the funny one and make a good, first impression. Usually all of these things lead to someone laughing; even if they really didn't have a reason to. Anyone who is shy around new people, will most likely laugh about anything they say. If it's someone you already knew, you could always be giggling about something. There are different types of relationships you build with different people and laughter is almost always the number one way to keep it together.   When you have been in a strong friendship with someone, you are already very close with each other. The laughing, crying, and fighting you do with that person, will make the relationship stronger. There are times that you spend with another individual that will makes steps towards sticking together. From my experiences, i will become somebodies close friend for quite sometime; then we will get into an argument and no longer be friends. Although we fought and wished to not talk, we became good friends again because of all the time we had spent laughing together. Being sad all the time, with no one else to laugh with, made us realize how much we missed each other. Even though meeting someone new was simple; it didn't last as long as the friendship i had with the other person.  Truly, when you meet someone for the first time, whether it's a boy or a girl, you will laugh and make jokes almost the whole time. That might even be how it will stay. Once you have known a person for so long, you can tell what type of relationship you will have with them. The connection you make with them is simple;you could get along, or you could always argue. No matter what relationship you make with an acquaintance, will most likely be the same all the time. When you are not as close with another person, you tend to not care about the friendship as often. You wont be as emotional, although your experiences you have with them could always lead to laughing. The time you spend with anyone should always be full of fun and laughter.      Another form of laughter could be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend. in my opinion, you will make a special connection with your other half. When two people have chosen to be together, they're choosing to spend their time getting to know each other on a different level. The fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love the you would have with a best friend. Couples should be enjoying their time together laughing, and making each other happy. Making each other laugh will allow them to be closer in friendship; becoming comfortable with one another. they will gain more confidence and ability, just by sharing the times laughing together.   The laughter you laugh with anyone, will build any type of relationship. Usually the first impression will identify the connection you have with that individual. There are always ways that you will act with one person and not the other. The three different types of friendship that are most common are; acquaintances, boy friend/girl friend, and close friends. All of the friends you make, people you meet, will involve a lot of laughter.

  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an "I'm sorry" or even a polite "@CAPS2 me" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied "@CAPS3" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled "@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said "@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless!

 So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events, like it's the only thing life consists of. We seem to never stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and appreciate those little things, everyone would realize just how much they really have. In some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story. Like it's some sort of competition. I personally don't want to have the worse story. If you just "go with it" things seem more lighthearted, care free, and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad. There is many times where I could have chosen to stay mad and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh, and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @DATE1 was the @CAPS1 dance. I was supposed to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (like always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out that it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents already drove away and they didn't have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at the school. While I was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them that the dance was canceled. My friend's mom was nice enough to come pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @LOCATION1's and play arcade games. We had an amazing time! We all got matching rings and I got two lollipops. When we were done we went up to our friends house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great evening full of laughing. I could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could have, but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been. Another example is when I was a freshman. There was one day that seem particularly hard. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting in the hall by myself, feeling like nobody cared. A senior that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that it's harder frown than it is to smile. I realized that he was absolutely right. Even though smiling takes more muscles, frowning in the long run has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I latter regret, but if I just "go with it" it doesn't seem near as bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that have no sad or depressing meaning. Or a millions books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall down, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartaches, @CAPS2.E class, and of course laughing. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why wouldn't you laugh as much as you possible could?
<START>

 Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load lightens, @PERSON1 I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in myself is more evident sometimes than others, such as if before the miracle of laughter I was feeling overworked, worn out, or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @PERSON1 I am grateful that my days are filled with great friends @PERSON1 funny memories.  One of the things that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be able to make each other laugh. I have had multiple times with my two best friends, @PERSON1, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave feeling happy, with a smile on my face, with many good stories to tell. One of these occasions was @PERSON1's birthday party the @DATE1 before last.  @PERSON1 wanted a small party with just the people closest to her there, so @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I were the only ones invited. We live a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much to do in the area of parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to @CAPS1, just half an hour away. It was a blistering @DATE1 day @PERSON1 we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON1 started her party off with a float on the meandering @CAPS2 river. That's when the laughing began. Three twelve year old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed @CAPS3, what could be so funny? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together. They thought it was hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river weed, or pond weed, or any type of water weed for that matter ) @PERSON1 that I would yelp or full out scream every time that some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @PERSON1 just couldn't hold on to her sandals, @PERSON1 would end up making wild dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way @PERSON1, the @CAPS4 that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. @PERSON1, naturally, we pushed her in numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, @PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friends @PERSON1 get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down @PERSON1 can be myself. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, @PERSON1 still have fun.  Our laughter can even change how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon of music @PERSON1 food. We all got enormous ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, @PERSON1 were playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the @CAPS3 the ball flies over @PERSON1 knocks all the ice cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysterics. Even through my disappointment I started cracking up as well, @PERSON1 then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, @PERSON1 I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax @PERSON1 let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together is often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure fire way to get them back on their feet @PERSON1 smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, lets me abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, @PERSON1 I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together.

                                         The @CAPS1 of Laughter  Many people think it is love that brings people together. But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run. Before you've ever loved someone though, you've laughed with them. Laughter creates conversation, mends relationships, and brings joy to people. Its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends.   In the kindergarten, everything was new to me. I got to leave my house, go to school, eat lunch, and go to recess. There were many children just like me, bouncing with excitement as our daily routine started. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one around to play with.   One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around next to my yard. I walked over and remembered him from that school day in my classroom.  "@CAPS2", was all I said. He turned around, and with all his might, burped as loud as he could. We fell into a fit of laughter and I knew I'd made a new friend that day. From then on, him and I were bestfriends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing about something. There was no need for our parents to set up any "playdates" or scheduled time to meet other children because it was easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally, not awkwardly while the parents chatted. From then on, making friends was a piece of cake.Through grade school and well into my teenage years, I had a best friend and a lot more friends, solely, because of a moment of laughter.  Laughing is something that can always "break the ice". Whenever you meet someone new, it's always kind of hard to just talk to them. You don't know whether to be serious, outgoing, funny, or quiet. But if something happens that makes both of you laugh, then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension in between. It's like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness, things just get easier and easier.  For many, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in every persons life and it can be hard to deal with at times. Whether it's a breakup, a depressive mood, or maybe even a death of a loved one, something funny and a laugh @MONTH1 help them get their mind off of whatever is bothering them. Most of them time that's all a person wants, something to help them forget what ever troubles them, if only for a few minutes. It's how people build better relationships, they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better.   Besides it's healing and conversation starting qualities, laughing is simply fun to do. It @MONTH1 start out as a small giggle, turn into a chuckle, and end up as a fifteen minute session of raging, side cramping laughter. And most of the time, you're with friends so they're enjoying the moment of fun and happiness right along with you.   If you've never laughed once in your life, there's something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, relieve painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Just try it, it's not that hard. I guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and make you happy.

When I was younger my sister and I would fight all the time. It would either be verbally or physically. Whatever we fought about we would drag on for hours. Not only would we get more upset as time went on, but my mom and family members got fed up. It didn't help that there was only @NUM1 months between us. It would make everything ten times more tense. My mom had a few tactics to try to get us to stop. One would be grounding us. But we shared a room so that would only make it worse. Another was giving us chores which took up both our time and was annoying , the last one was making us sit criss cross apple sauce, face eachother, and hold hands. We hated this one. But every time that we did it we would end up cracking up and forgetting what we were even fighting about. After we did this we would give eachother a hug and move on. The laughter brought us closer and always helped to fix things.

 Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. "@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,"@CAPS2 come here." I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,"@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS2 always remember that." I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity.

 Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2 , and @CAPS3. On my birthday the whole @CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the @DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. Then on the @DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS2. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS3! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad "A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1".

                          A funny Story  Many summers ago, @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1 and I had a sleepover at @CAPS1 house. We were both excited because @CAPS1 dad would be the only one there. @CAPS1 mom and brother were out late. After eating popcorn and getting stuffed up on candy, we decided to try something new and fun. @CAPS1 house has a counter bar where four to five people can sit at and so @CAPS1 daddy decided to turn on some hip hop music. As though @PERSON1 and I could read each others minds we jumped on the counter and started doing the run way model walk. We worked it like no other. It was funny to see @CAPS1 dad pretending to be the fake photographer and say that's "gorgeous" as though he was a real photographer. @PERSON1 and I strutted up and down and did stops and poses and turns, until we got too dizzy. We all knew we could never do this with @CAPS1 mom @ORGANIZATION1 which made everything so funny! We all bursted out laughing until we couldn't breath! Later on after that fun model runway we decided to pillow surf down the stairs. I was a little afraid to at first but after I saw the look on @PERSON1's face, I knew I had to do it. I grabbed a big body pillow and surfed down those stairs like a champ! It was such a blast! @PERSON1 and I kept pillow @CAPS2 for what seems forever! @CAPS1 dad put on @ORGANIZATION1 and we laughed the rest of the night away. That night was one of the best and @ORGANIZATION1 memories of @CAPS1 childhood.

 In my opinion, I think that laughter is a very important part of life. What would the world be like without laughter and jokes? It would be a very boring and dull place. I can't even imagine what it would be like. The world needs to have laughter in it. People need to make jokes and they need to have laughter and comedy in their life. I myself have a lot of laughter in my life. One day in fifth grade my best friend and I were jogging around the track for gym class. We were running together and talking and telling jokes to each other to help pass the time because it was really boring. I told this one really awesome joke, I can't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We were both laughing together to the point we were crying. He fell down on the track, and rolled off into the grass. I said "@CAPS1 on we need to keep going or the gym teacher will get mad". He said, "I can't, I just peed my pants!." That made me laugh even more. He got up and walked over to the gym teacher. The gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurse's office. After gym class was over I met him back up with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mom and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. I wonder what his mom must have thought. It was a funny day.  We have always talked about that day together from then on. I would always jokingly make fun of him for peeing his pants, but I told him a funny joke. Our whole relationship was based on making each other laugh and telling jokes. Just all around the two of us being stupid together was what we did. Jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that I might possibly have for the rest of my life. At the same time, if you have no jokes and laughter in your friendship, it can make your relationship very boring and lame. If you do not have any, or little laughter in your friendship, then you do not have fun with that person and it makes you not want to hang around them because it just feels boring.  I have this other friend named @CAPS2, I occasionally go over to his house and we hang out and play video games together. The weird thing is, we hardly even communicate with each other. We just do stuff and don't have any fun with it. There is no jokes or laughter or anything awesome like that. We just play his video games silently not saying a word to the other person. Its the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It is the most boring friendship two people could have. It is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over. I don't really like going over there that much. I would rather be at a different friends house having fun, but I still go over there anyway and I am not sure why. Without jokes and laughter in a friendship, it just makes things boring and not fun. It is something you definitely need to have. Laughter is not just an important element in a friendship, it is also an important element to have in a dating relationship. If you are dating somebody, then you absolutely need to have laughter in your relationship. If you look around you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time, having fun. It makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Think about it, who wants to date a boring person that doesn't like to laugh and make jokes? Nobody wants to. So in a dating relationship you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship. You want to keep things going good so the other person likes you and thinks your funny. That is one of the key things that makes a couple close. So as you can see by my three examples, laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general. If you have laughter in a friendship it can really impact the relationship in a very good way. It makes it an interesting and fun relationship. Laughter makes people happy and get along with each other. If you are feeling down, laughter can always bring you up and make you feel better. It is almost like a medicine. If you do not have laughter, it can really make things suck, and make the relationship boring. Nobody wants that. People do not want a boring, lifeless relationship with somebody. Laughter is something that bring people together in a good way. It brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends. We have a good time and really enjoy ourselves. Laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life.

                            From Laughter to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the first day of school last year, I walked through the doors of the school hoping I would make a friend or two. I was not sure of how this would happen but I hoped for the best. I entered my first class and sat at a table with all unknown faces. I wanted to say something but was afraid of their reactions. The teacher made us play a couple games where we had to introduce ourselves. Those didn't really help. Everybody was tense and it was all awkward. I @CAPS3 wanted to be myself already and make friends. For the rest of the day, all my classes were like that. Everybody was tense and awkward, like something was keeping us quiet. Not knowing anybody didn't help the situation a bit. That was the first day for me. The second day I walk through the school doors determined to make some friends. I thought about what jokes I could say, what interesting thing about myself I could share, but to me all those sounded like stupid ideas. I walk into humanities and sat at a table with a friendly looking girl. The teacher told us to introduce ourselves to the other students at the table we were sitting at. For a minute or so it was very silent, but i wanted to introduce myself so bad. I couldn't stand this silence any longer. I looked in by back pack to grab a pencil and I see a note from my mom saying " @CAPS4 be yourself and make some friends honey, have a great day at school. :) ". I started laughing because I thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back pack. It was so unexpected and I felt like a child. I started laughing and when I looked up, I saw that the girl next to me was laughing too. I knew I had to say something, so I did. I said, " @CAPS5 my names @PERSON1, but you can call me @CAPS4 for short. Whats your name? ". The girl looked at me, smiled, and said, " @CAPS5, my names @CAPS8". Then I asked her what middle school she came from and other questions. We stared talking, we exchanged numbers, and we became good friends. From laughter to @CAPS1, who would have known? A year has gone by and we are still friends. We always laugh about how we started talking. A few days ago I told her how I felt @CAPS2 that second day of school. I told her I was scared to introduce myself. She said she felt the same way and she didn't know what to do either. Since then I thank my mom for writing that note because without it I wouldn't have laughed and made @CAPS8 laugh and I wouldn't have made such a great friend.

 It's the first day of high school and your gut is full of butterflies that make you want to run to the bathrooms and hide from the world. I had @CAPS7 friends yet and I was to shy to go and join any of the groups so I walked to all of my classes alone. Students would get in my face wanting to know what school I came from and wanted to know all about me. I remember wanting to be left alone, hidden in my own bubble space. Girls would ask @CAPS5 I was upset since I wasn't smiling or having fun getting to know my new classes. Lunch was much more crowded than my old school. Students would sit in hallways eating their lunch or crowd around one big table chattering loudly to one another. I chewed on my lip looking for a spot that wasn't occupied by students. I found a table near the front of the lunch room that was empty and placed my brown lunch sack in front of me eating my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and settled down next to me laughing at one another for not getting a seat next to me."@CAPS1 I'm @PERSON3, what's your name?" was a skinny boy in a black caps response to me. "@PERSON1" was all I replied to all of them who stared at me the entire time."That's a pretty name, I'm @LOCATION1, this is @LOCATION2, you just met @PERSON3, and @PERSON4 is the funny kid next to you with his orange back pack," I smiled and nodded to them @ORGANIZATION2 had on a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 t-shirt and @PERSON2 had on a military uniform that said @CAPS4. They all ate lunch at the school and got pizza or sub sandwiches. They showed pictures of funny events on their phones to everyone even including me."@CAPS5 that kid isn't careful he might get razor rash." I said laughing a little looking at the picture of a little boy sliding down a slide that looked like a cheese grader. @PERSON3 took off all his pepperoni and was flinging it randomly in the air. @PERSON2 was going to take a picture of everyone for picture id on her phone. @PERSON4 was next for his picture to be taken when the pepperoni in @LOCATION3's hands slipped and landed smack on @ORGANIZATION1's face. I busted up laughing and everyone at the table joined in. @PERSON3 and I were clenching our stomachs and wiping away tears. @PERSON4 went to the bathroom to wash away the smell from his face and when he returned @PERSON2 said,"@CAPS6 my word you should see your face I took your picture right after the pepperoni hit your face and your picture is just hilarious, your mouth is hanging open like your going to eat something and like your angry." @PERSON2 handed her phone to one person at a time and we all started to laugh again asking for @PERSON2 to send the picture to each of them."I was wondering @CAPS5 I could be your guys friend?" I asked looking them all in the eye. @ORGANIZATION2 was the only one to respond,"@CAPS7 you can't be our friend, @PERSON1 duh @CAPS5 we didn't want to be your friend then we wouldn't be hanging out with you." @ORGANIZATION2 teased. My twisted gut loosened with re-leaf."@CAPS8 we probably would have made some excuse to leave," @PERSON3 smiled. I laughed at myself for worrying that I wouldn't fit in or have friends who could make me laugh as hard as I did when the pepperoni stuck to @LOCATION4's face.

Laughter can sometimes be something that everyone shares together, sometimes it's used only for few as it's aimed against one another. But hopefully most of the time it's something that we all can share. Laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another. Someone could be a complete stranger to one another and then just by a simple joke, laughter could make them look like they've been friends for years. Now laughing isn't the only thing that helps people become acquainted with one another, they can share similar hobbies or likes and dislikes, but most of the time laughter is something that everyone needs in a relationship. I remember when I fisrt met my friend @PERSON1, he wasn't to outgoing, but through making jokes he seemed more comfortable in talking with others. Me and him would often talk about @CAPS1 our daily lifes where to much to handle, but instead of making jokes about it, we decided to laugh about @CAPS1 we were complaining when our lifes we easy compared to others. Some people have to work @NUM1 jobs to support a family and we're over here complaining about @CAPS1 we have to wake up and go to school, we laughed at @CAPS1 pathetic we sounded. A couple of days later we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do when we older and out of high school. @PERSON1 said he wants to be a taekwando instuctor and that he's already got a small job at one, I said "@CAPS1 did you get the job?", he replied "I kicked a kid in the face pretty hard when my instuctor was watching". We both laughed really hard, and just by that laugh we became even more of friends, cause it's through laughter that we can become civilized.

     Laughter @CAPS1 is one the most important things in life. People shouldn't go a day without @CAPS1. It's healthy and good in any relationship. It can also help with healing. The best kind of laughter is when you're out of breath and crying. It makes people so happy and wanting more. Don't take life too seriously, just laugh and smile all the time.  Someone dying is a dreadful thing. When two high school boys die, it's even worse. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, a group of high school students were walking on the rocks by the ocean, when a sneaker wave snatched two of them. The other kids tried so hard to save them by making a rope of clothing to reach them, but it didn't work. Two beautiful lives were taken away that day, and will not be forgotten. The boys were well liked and had great lives. The families of the students, the school, friends and the community were in shock, and couldn't believe the terrible news. How could this happen to such amazing people.  Hundreds of students gathered at church the following @DATE2, most in tears. They talked about the two boys, and had a huge group prayer. Friends spoke well of them, missing them greatly, talking about the good, fun, memorable times. @CAPS1 can make it better. As someone once said, smile because they lived, don't cry because they're gone. At the school's basketball game, they honored the boys, and won the game for them. Parents and friends spoke about the beautiful kids in front of almost @NUM1 people, that came to support the school. The game was a time for having a good time and not to sob and mope. This game helped heal the community just a little more. @CAPS1 and cheering really can help the heart.  As days, weeks, and months go on, people will still be heartbroken. Although, as long as we laugh and smile about the good times of those who left, we can make it though anything. @CAPS1 makes you feel better. It just shows you that you have to make the best with what you have, and always have a fun time with no regrets. Always tell the people that mean something to you, that you love them. Never stop telling people you love them, and never leave in a fight. You don't know when it might be the last time you see them. @CAPS1 is so important, and without it life would not be as great as it is.

 People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character "@CAPS2". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from "@CAPS2" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the "demonic voice". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to "move in" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she "moved out" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; "Laughter is the best medicine" "Laughter is the shortest distance between people" "@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes"; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing.

One day i was going to my friend @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1's house for her @NUM1 birthday party. I knew the birthday party was going to be a lot of fun even though it was only going to be @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 and I. I didn't know it was going to be as fun as it turned out to be though. The whole day i was waiting for it to be @NUM2 so i could go to her house. I packed all my bags and got everything ready, because it was a sleep over. As i was one my way to her she called me and said "before you get to my house look to the right."  The whole way my dad and i were driving to her house i kept my eyes on the right side of the rode, i wasn't quit sure what i was looking for though. As we got closer i saw something in the bushes. It was @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON2. I told my dad to honk at them so they knew i was there and as he did, they both pulled down there pants and mooned us! I was laughing so hard the whole night i kept thinking about the look on my dads face! Little did i know that wasn't going to be the funniest thing that happened that night. Later on @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2 and I went on a walk down to the dock by @LOCATION1 house. While we were on the dock a bat flew by and @PERSON2 almost fell in the water cause she was so scared. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were standing behind her laughing so hard! By that time it was getting kind of dark and her neighbors were being really loud. So we ran from the dock to her neighbors house and hid and started yelling things at them to quiet down! It was so funny because they had no idea where the yells were coming from so they just kept looking around confused. We started laughing so hard we could hardly be quiet. We had to wait a while for her neighbors to stop looking around trying to figure out who was telling them to be quiet. That's not the funniest thing that happened either! As we were walking back to @LOCATION1 house we heard a car coming so we made a plan I stood in the middle of the street and @ORGANIZATION1 stood ahead of me while @PERSON2 was hiding in the bushes. The plan was @ORGANIZATION1 and I were going to pretend to be in a fight and @PERSON2 was going to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me. So the car starts turning the corner and me and @ORGANIZATION1 start fake fighting. As the car gets closer it starts slowing down and here come @PERSON2 running out of the bushes and @CAPS2! Pretends to fake shoot me. I fall to the ground like i am really hurt trying to hold back my laughs, and man did we think we got the people in the car good. Then we realize there is no way she actually shot me when there was no gun shot sound at all! So the people in the car come up closer and they are laughing so hard that we can hear them before we can even see who it is. When they got closer we realized it was just some of @ORGANIZATION1's family friends coming over for the party so they knew it was fake the whole time. When it got darker outside we found a huge watermelon and took it out to a bridge by @LOCATION1 house. We brought her video camera and put it on night vision and threw the watermelon of the bridge. When it hit the water it mad a really loud sound and split into a bunch of tiny pieces! That night was one of the best and funniest nights i have ever had. The next day all the fun continued by going to the lake and swinging on rope swings into the water. @ORGANIZATION1 got a really bad rope burn and it was hilarious! @PERSON2, @ORGANIZATION1 and I always have the best time together and tons of laughs. A lot more happened that night, it was overall a great @NUM1 birthday for @ORGANIZATION1. I'm glad i got to be there with her for it.

 We all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance. But looking back on the same occurrence you just have to laugh at how silly it was. I recall one of these experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this @DATE1. It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area. I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later that day I found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river. In the @TIME1, I remembered some spurs off the main road from when I have driven with my brother in these woods and decided to go explore some of them near my camp. I decided to go check out one across the river that looked like a fun ride. As I was crossing the it my front tire hit some lose rocks causing me to fall into the water! Thankfully I fell away from my motorcycle, if I hadn't it could very well have fallen on me which, out in the woods by myself, would have put me in quite the predicament. After getting my @ORGANIZATION1 up and out of the water I headed back to camp to dry my clothes off, seeing as how I only brought one set with me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up I realized that the sun had been up for some time now so I decided that I had better get going on another ride before the day's out. This time I stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that lead up to the top of the ridge. As I climbed it became increasingly warm then I broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight. The sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun shine. After a while of just sitting I got going again. The road I was on started to taper down into a valley. At the bottom of it, flood waters had washed large quantity's of silt over the road and it was still muddy. As I crossed it my wheels started spinning out and flinging mud at me as a result I ended up very dirty. Once again I headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river. This time I didn't fall a sleep for quite some time and when I did it was a fit full one.upon waking I packed up my meager supply's and headed out to complete my journey. Most of a day got me only half way to my destination so I was forced to stop and rest for the night. Just setting out my tent and getting out some food for dinner and breakfast in the @TIME1 didn't take me very long. Having little to occupy my time I just sat by my fire and pondered my trip and life in general. When I fell asleep I slept soundly until @TIME1. Waking to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing by me was delightful and invigorating. It only took me a few hours to reach where my dad was going to meet me and take me home.This trip helped me think and gater my thoughts. It also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted. Looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set backs. All in all it was a very good time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul.

 Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, as crying is of sadness. It is just another natural emotion any person is born with. I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in life together where they are happy. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke. Its always good to have a sense of humor because its something everyone appreciates, also, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well, one of the main things you will hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and that your having a good time.  Of course there are times when its better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often gets annoying. Yes laughing means your happy, but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise, it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other, i like when people have a good sense of humor, i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it is natural, you have to know when you can and cant laugh. Its a way to show happiness, but in certain situations, it can be disrespectful or rude.  Sometimes when I'm with my friends, they @MONTH1 joke around about a certain person, and once it happened like this;at my friends birthday party, we all went to a bowling alley and as always, were all standing around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking around about something and then @PERSON3 said something as to turn him down in some way, ask a joke, and @PERSON4 said that hes going to get his heart broken. Right after that was said, @ORGANIZATION1 pitched in, adding again. So it turned out to sound like @PERSON4 was going to have his heart broken again. As everyone laughed at it, @PERSON4 looked at @ORGANIZATION1 with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. You see, @PERSON4 had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about that and didn't mean anything when she added "again". She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean. In this case, the laughter caused by @ORGANIZATION1 was meant for @PERSON4, who was hurt by @ORGANIZATION1's comment. Good thing @ORGANIZATION1 noticed and remembered about @PERSON4's ex later that day. She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying.  How a person takes it when people laugh at them, has a lot to do with friendship. One time, my friends were driving to a party, or home from a party and were listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by @PERSON1. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard @PERSON2 sing really loud, with no music. Everyone started laughing because @PERSON2 didn't know that @CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. Even though it was kind of embarrassing, @PERSON2 laughed along because it was pretty funny. If @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 weren't such good friends, i think for sure @PERSON2 would have gotten mad at @CAPS1 for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two. Friends understand each others sense of humor, and know when doing something is going to far, or when the other person will think it's funny too and will laugh along. So as you see, laughter can be happy, thankful, annoying, and or mean, you just have to know when it's okay to do, and when it is better not to laugh. Even though it's a natural reaction, it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing. Next time someone says something that's funny, first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy.

 One day I decided to go over to my friend @PERSON1's house. When I went over there we cleaned the pool and i ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger. This was one of the days that me and @PERSON1 laughed more then ever!  We started the day just laying in her bad and watching a movie on her tiny @CAPS1. I can't really remember what movie is was but it doesn't really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things.  After the movie was over we went out into the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob because @PERSON1 doesn't have cable in her room. At the time, I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I got myself situated on the couch and @PERSON1 sat next to me. Her dad came in about @NUM1 minutes later with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me booger lip, which is where he puts the booger on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't get away he would really put in on my lip because he had done it before. it hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so I hoped as fast as I could on one leg. I hid in @PERSON1's closet and all I could hear in the background was @PERSON1's laughter and her dads footsteps. I waited in her closet for like @NUM2 minutes and the got out because I could tell the coast was clear. I went back out in the living room and @PERSON1 and I laughed about the whole thing.  After we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool. we were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there. there were tat poles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there. We got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets. We didn't notice the tad poles until then. We didn't want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew that there would dry up and die. So every time we scooped a bucket full of water, we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can that we had saved the tad poles and scooping all of the water out took about @NUM3 and a half hours. after that we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find and so we went and got the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. That was taking too long and it wasn't very fun so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around. I slipped about a dozen times and so did she. It was hard to stay on our feet. We laughed so hard I almost peed myself but I couldn't go inside because I was soaked and I had soap all over my body. After the pool was all spick and span we had to scoop all out the soap and water out again. All of this took about @NUM4 hours but it was really and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she doesn't have to do it.  After my grandpa came to get me, me and @PERSON1 said our goodbyes. I went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life. Over all, I think on this day I laughed more then ever before.

I think that laughter is very important. It is very important to me because let's say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think its funny it's going to hurt that student. I think that instead of laughing at someone that you could be a good kid and ask him if he is ok and help him up. That shows that student that he really has a friend that cares about him alot and doesn't laugh at him and really cares about his best friend. You also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me it's really not about what I get it's the things i do to help out my peer's . I think that we should not laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and reacact to things like laughing at someone else. I also think that if I would have fell and I got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me so thats what I learn respect the students the way that you want to be respected. So I wouldnt like people to make fun of me so why would I like to make fun of someone else if I wouldnt want them to make fun of me thats why you should treat your peers with respect.

 One day i was with my friend @PERSON1. We had been friends for a really long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog, taco ran away and i had gotten into an arguement with my parents. @CAPS4 asked me if i wanted to go out on a walk, and i said i did. We were really good friends at this piont, and @CAPS4 always knew when something was wrong, even though i think i hide @CAPS1 pretty well. As we wakled, we walked past children playing at the park with thier parents, and a man playing fetch with his dog, @CAPS1 was sunny and warm. @CAPS1 was durring the summer-time. We stood on the bridge for a minute, then @CAPS4 asked me "whats wrong, @CAPS2?" @CAPS3 @CAPS1 odl him everything that happend, i told him that my dog had ran away and that my parents were mad at me. I told him that i was sad. I dont know why i opend up to him like that we hardly ever talk about our life drama. we're always laughing and making jokes. I thought @CAPS4 liked me, actually i was hoping @CAPS4 did. I liked him, i had for a while.  We started talking about everything that was going on in our lifes, school, friends, parents, and alot more. @CAPS4 put me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at the pic-nic tables. We sat across from eachother, and sat there talking for a while. Then @CAPS1 started getting late and i had to get home. I said "thanks for cheerig me up, i really needed to laugh and smile today." @CAPS4 looked at me, and took my hand in his and said "@CAPS5 should always laugh, because @CAPS5 never know who is falling in love with your smile." and then @CAPS4 kissed me. That is the a day i'll remember for a long time. I'm still with @PERSON1, we've been together for almost @NUM1 months now.

 The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case, the extreme weather was @CAPS1. I lived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at this time and was eight years old. It happened in the middle of @DATE1, @CAPS3 an almost record high temperature occurred @LOCATION2. The day had peaked at one hundred twenty five degrees @CAPS4, and to make matters much worse, our entire neighborhoods power had gone out. Nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured. We lived in a gated community, and everyone got along great. People from the neighborhood gathered together and put up tents for shade, and provided everyone with cold water. There are important things that you must remember @CAPS3 a situation like this happens, you must have a good attitude, because it's no help to be complaining, also to not think about the @CAPS1, and to help other people who need it. I don't think that our community would have lasted, if it weren't of everyone's great attitude and spirit, and of course, the laughter. It is so important to have a good attitude during a situation like this. What is the point of complaining and getting mad for no reason? I was told that it would not last forever, and to keep my chin up. I could tell that the many other kids, and even adults who were complaining were have a much harder time coping with this situation. It was very hard for me no not complain, being an eight year-old, but I eventually managed with the help of a lot of water. If you keep your spirits up, and interact with people, the say seems to go by much faster. I remember @CAPS3 my whole family was under one of the tents, just sitting around telling funny stories, and telling jokes. I would have much rather had a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. Out of the many important things you could possibly do, is to not think about the @CAPS1. If you don't think about it, then you will have a much better time and not be complaining. It is important in many situations to keep your mind off the topic so you won't be stressed out. I saw many people there who just couldn't take it. They would only say how bad it was, and it was very easy to tell that they were all stressed out. If you try to make the situation a good one, and not keep thinking about it, then you will get through it, no matter how bad it is. During this @CAPS2 of @CAPS1, many people needed assistance. The community was a big help because they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad, people were suffering from @CAPS1 exhaustion, and many of them had to be put on @CAPS5's. There were several ambulances there to help people out and get them back to normal. Some people did need to go to the hospital and get further attention. The community eventually got through the day with so serious injuries. The power came back on at around six o'clock. Being exhausted the people slowly walked or drove back to their houses. Our whole family walked back to the house and immediately turned on the air conditioning. Everyone was so relieved and happy that we were finally out of that situation. Even at night, the day was at a low of one hundred twelve degrees. We played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all. Our family had stayed strong through the @CAPS1, while many others didn't last. It just goes to show that ,"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."

 Laughter is such a great joy in my life. If people never laughed life would be dull and boring, most of my favorite experiences involve @CAPS9 while having a good time. One of my best experiences with laughter was going camping with my friends last @DATE2. I will never forget that experience last @DATE2.  During the middle of @DATE2 on a beautiful sunny @DATE1 @TIME1 my @CAPS4 @CAPS1 calls me and @CAPS2 me were getting a bunch of guys to go camping and I should come. Immediately I @CAPS3 my parents to let me go with the only exception of turning in my job application to @ORGANIZATION1 before I left for camping. After turning in my application I got in the car picked up my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 and makings for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and left for the adventure.  After I got to my destination after driving @NUM1 miles up river I didn't see anyone just two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be. Looking @CAPS5 the camp site had been attacked by bears with trash laying all around and camp fire still going i started searching for my friends. I found @CAPS1 passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him but he was dead asleep. @PERSON3 and me not knowing what to do so we sat in the shade of the large trees surrounding us, it was a good @NUM2 degrees outside. After about five minuets we herd a splash and went to investigate. We walked towards the river and found all of out friends jumping off a @NUM3 ft rock into the river and we went to join the fun. After jumping off about @NUM4 times each we headed back to camp. @CAPS1 was awake and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS7, @PERSON3 and myself all huddled around the camp fire @CAPS8 we returned to camp and told jokes all night.  All of us really bonded that three day camping trip @CAPS9 and joking and just being boys. I wouldn't get rid of those memory's for anything. After camping i returned to home and worked a lot of the rest of @DATE2 but ever since then have had really good friendships with all of my camping buddies.

 Once upon a time on @DATE1, I had my birthday party and my friends come over. My friend tree brought his projector over and hooked his @CAPS1 to it. We played @CAPS2: @CAPS3 on his projector and on my @CAPS4.V. with my @CAPS1. Then we got bored and all of us went out into the living room with the girls and chilled and hung out for a while then we had cake, had an icing fight, and played games laughed so hard. Then we went to the park that was by our apartment. We played @CAPS6 and made jokes and laughed a lot more. Then we went back to my place and we watched @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @NUM1 and laughed at the people who screamed. Then we play spin the bottle/truth or dare and we laughed a lot.
<START>

 The only true story that I can remember that involves laughter was about @NUM1 years ago at the beach. I was with my mom and my sister @LOCATION1. I was running from incoming waves when I decided to run into just one wave which that wave sweep me off my feet and spun me around for what seemed like forever, but wasn't even @NUM2 seconds. I laughed so hard that I tripped and i started spinning again, my mom had to get me up because I could not stop. I got so many cuts from the sand that it was hilarious. after I got changed I got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it. That's the only time I remember laughter being my true friend.

 My @CAPS1 year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth grade year I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course I sulked but looking back on it now I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However one can't go through life without any friends so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance however was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point.  Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends @MONTH1 not understand, but when you have no where to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends I could always share my sisters. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my @CAPS1 year. I had all knew classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did.  It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if thing might not change after all. However after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear they would have spoke quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to "look at her, shes laughing so hard at you shes crying!" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends.

 I'm going to tell you a story of smiles, laughter, and love. The story of my @DATE3 and how I changed the a girl's life and my own with only smiles and laughs. I have three major memories of my time with her, there was the first smile, the day at the beach, and the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. Staring with with the beginning, these memories are about me and my neighbors exchange student @PERSON1 and they are memories, they are not perfect. The @TIME1 I made @PERSON1 smile. It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME1 out on the back lawn of grandmothers house which over looks the @ORGANIZATION1 gorge, perfect for watching the firework show. The lawn was even inclined so the you don't have to sit up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 came over to sit with me as i waited for the show. @PERSON1 sat to the left of me and @CAPS1, my neighbor and life long friend, to the right. I was very curious about @PERSON1, what she was like, what part of @LOCATION3 she lived in, how were her costumes different than ours. So i started to ask her some questions as we waited. I didn't get much it was obvious that she was shy, very shy. Finlay I got a conversation going between the three us us about the fire works that had started. @PERSON1 was telling us how the fire works back home in @LOCATION3 were much bigger than ours. Of course me being sarcastic i said "@CAPS2 really". She just smiled. the rest of the @TIME1 the conversations flowed much freer between me and @PERSON1 and it was a wonderful evening. Next we have the day at the beach. This happened about @DATE1 for the @TIME1 memory. @PERSON1 and me were good friends and she had lost her shyness and i was starting to really like her. We arrived at the beach the beach down on the @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1. It was starting to becoming a hot day, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked the towels and other random beach stuff. Soon all of us were in the water, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 (@PERSON1's host sister), @CAPS4 (@CAPS1's boyfriend), and me. In a bit of a flirting mood I started to splash @PERSON1 who happened to be by @CAPS1. This started a very large splash war with every one splashing everyone else. Every one was laughing and having a great time. It abruptly stopped because everyone didn't want water in there face any more. Soon there after I dove under the water an tried to lift @PERSON1 up and then drop her in the water, it underlay failed though because I missed and only caught her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. That was a good wet day at the beach. Finally, my @TIME1 memory is the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. We had just finished eating dinner and it was @PERSON1's @TIME1 in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. By now we were practically boyfriend girlfriend. It was getting dark at @LOCATION2 @LOCATION4 as we arrived at the @LOCATION4 forMovies in the @LOCATION4.. @TIME1 at the @CAPS7 was playing that @TIME1. I found a good spot and set out the blanket. we lay there talking as we waited for the movie to start. I had a flash back of all the laughs that had brought us close together. I knew at moment that I was really going to miss her more than i had missed anyone befor. It felt like the right moment as the sun was setting over the valley, I leaned in and kissed her and she kissed right back, I'll spare you the rest. Afterward we laughed and cried. For she was leaving early the next morning and we were in love. Yes I used the @CAPS8 world but it was and is true. We absolutely did not want the movie to end and yet it still did. As I drove her back to her host family's house we talk about the amazing @DATE3 we had together and all the smiles and laughs we shared. I smiled and laughed a lot that @DATE3 and it did bring me very close to someone. @PERSON1 and I still talk nearly every day it is hard but I've never felt as close to her as any one else. I will always have the memories of that @DATE3, the @DATE2 of @DATE2, That day at the beach, and @PERSON1"s @TIME1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION1. I hope you enjoyed the story of my @DATE3 and I hope you can have an amazing @DATE3 ,like I had.

 Summertime is always the highlight of the year for teenagers. It's when temperatures are the highest, we are able to stay out later, and its when we have the best memories of our childhood that we will never forget. It seems like there is never a dull moment when it comes to that time of year. Everyone seems to always get together and find something crazy and fun to do. @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, and I were sitting at home with nothing to do and decided that we were hungry. Without us having a car, we have to walk everywhere so we chose the closest place to @LOCATION1's house, which was at the time, @ORGANIZATION1. We left @ORGANIZATION1's at about ten o clock and started walking around, trying to find something to do. We texted @CAPS1 and found out that he was with @PERSON1 so we all decided that we wanted to hang out at @ORGANIZATION2's house. We had absolutely no idea where he lived so they told us to meet them at the skate park. By then, it was pretty dark and we were still walking. When we got to the park, it was pretty late. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 arrived a couple minutes later so we started walking towards @ORGANIZATION2's house.  @PERSON1 has the most evil cat i have ever met. @CAPS1 has told me stories and showed me videos about that cat a million times before. When we got there, it was bouncing off the walls and @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and I were scared of it. We didn't want it anywhere close to us because we thought it was going to attack us, eventually it did a couple of times. @PERSON1 was pointing the laser pointer all over the place for the cat to chase it and we were just sitting there, still bored. They were looking through our purses and saw that we had bathing suits because we went to the beach earlier, that gave them the wonderful idea of going fishing at one in the @TIME1. We all piled in the car and headed for the dike. We got there in our tank tops and short shorts and it was freezing. We were huddling for warmth. We couldn't see the ground and kept tripping over little holes and tree trunks everywhere. We finally got to a little dock that looked like it was ready to break and sink at any moment. @PERSON1 grabbed his @CAPS3 fishing pole and marched his way to the edge of the dock. There was no way the rest of us could all stand on it without breaking. We were taking a ton of pictures and had a ton of fun watching @PERSON1 try and fish and @CAPS1 just being @CAPS1.  In the end, we found something to do out of nothing. When people experience the greatness in little things they realize that they could enjoy everything a lot more. That night was one of the most memorable nights of that @DATE1.

I was about ten when this story happened to me. I was with my grandma when the story happened. We were at the park and I put my head in the monkey bars. My grandma had went to the bathroom and I was stick in the monkey bars.The kids at the park thought it was funny and were laughing at me. I was really embarrassed.When I got my head out of the monkey bars I told the kids that they should try putting there head in the monkey bars. The other kids tried doing it and they all got there heads stuck in the monkey bars. The kid did not know that I had practiced putting my head in the monkey bars so that it would not get stuck. I was laughing very hard at what I had just done and when my grandma came out I asked if we could go home. The next day we went back to the park and I got some different kids with the same trick. What I don't get is if my head was stuck why would they try the same thing. The kids this time told there mom and dad what I did and they told my grandma and I got in a lot of trouble.We went home and I was grounded for about two weeks. The next time I went to the park I did the same thing. That shows that kids will be kids.

                                  Friendship and Laughter go @CAPS1 in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 best friend and I would spend hours sitting on her bed laughing at nothing. We could tell stories to each other that, to other people would just be stupid, but to us were hilarious. We would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that was all before the big fight. We have had fights before but none like this. I knew that the decision I would make would ruin our friendship, and take away all of our laughter, but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done. So i said goodbye. @CAPS3 best friends name is @CAPS4, we have known each other sense we were two and have been inseparable sense then. We love to hang out and be together. That was until the fight were I was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and I. I remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do that to me. But I didn't care enough to ask her about it, so I ended the friendship. It hurt but I had talked myself into believing that it was all true. But something didn't feel right, something told me that it wasn't her. But I didn't want to hear it. I ignored the feeling and just went on with life. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in @CAPS3 life. School was a whole other story, it's really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and a couple classes together. It was like I had to keep reminding myself "your not friends anymore, you don't have to talk to her", like subconsciously i didn't want to end the friendship. I missed talking to her, so one day I said hello, after that we talked nonstop, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. Except there was one thing missing, the laughter. Sense then we have become closer, we hadn't talked about the fight, but it got to the point to where we could occasionally laugh or giggle at something one of us had said, but never the kind of the laughs that we used to share. I never thought that we would have been able to speak, nevertheless be friends again.  After a few weeks we both sighed up for a youth camp. During that camp I found out the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and came to the agreement that the whole fight had been both of our faults. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and her's because she didn't try hard enough to show me the truth. During that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together. The tension between us broke and fell of our shoulders like a very heavy pack that we both had been carrying. We both apologized for our parts in everything and then went to dinner, and laughed throughout the meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it's a very important piece of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love. Sam and I are still working things out between us but we are on our way to being closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never have a dull moment, we have both decided to work very hard at not having another fight between us. We have both realized that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and laughter inside of the friendship. I love @CAPS3 best friend very much and I love the laughter that we share together just as much, and I don't want to lose that again. So everyday I'm going to make sure that we laugh as much as possible and I'm never going to take our friendship for granted again.

               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought"@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home."I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,"@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there.

 In the @DATE1, a primary group of friends would search for different adventures to part take in. This group of people consisted of kids of all ages, @PERSON5@NUM1, @PERSON1@NUM2, @PERSON2@NUM3, and @PERSON4@NUM4. Around late @DATE2, on a hot day, @PERSON5 got an idea to head over to @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2 and go cliff diving. He called it the "cliffs". So the whole group got together and took off on an hour car ride to @LOCATION2. Once they got there, it only got hotter outside, and the need for cooling off was getting to be a priority. They parked, then walked the train tracks. The closer they got to they're destination, the louder the voices that they @CAPS1 hearing became. The spot was a secluded area with a rocky floor, people getting a running start to jump off the highest peak and go crashing on to the waters surface below. Right away @PERSON5 and @PERSON1 wanted to get settled so that they could join the others. As for @PERSON4 and @PERSON2, it could wait. Once @PERSON1 and @PERSON5 got they're first couple jumps in, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 thought that maybe it was time to try it. But not from the highest peak. Maybe something a bit lower. Something like the very bottom of the cliff, just for starters. Before they jumped off they noticed a little beach on the other side of the creek, so the girls conversed with the boys and they all decided to jump off at the same time, and swim to the little beach. Although they all jumped from different heights, they all seemed to arrive around the same time. For @PERSON5 it was a bit more of a struggle to swim that far. But @PERSON4 was right by his side helping him along the way. As the group relaxed in the @DATE1 air for a while, they became to realize that they @CAPS1 hungry, but much to lazy to swim back, climb up the rocks, and walk the train tracks back to the car. But hunger was taking over. As they swam back, climbed the rocks, gathered they're belongings and headed back, they started brainstorming for a place to eat. "@CAPS1 going to be going through @CAPS2." @PERSON1 said. "@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1!" @PERSON4 shouted. At that moment the decision was made. On the ride back, they switched drivers and sitting arrangements. Once they got to @CAPS2 they all stopped at @ORGANIZATION1 and filled they're stomach's up. They all chose to stop at @PERSON5 work @ORGANIZATION3, to say hi to some of his friends. @PERSON4 was @PERSON5 girlfriend so they had some showing off to do. They all finished up saying they're hello's, and went back to @LOCATION1 house where all the cars @CAPS1 parked. @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 decided to shower, while @PERSON1 wanted to play some video games, as for @PERSON2, she headed to home to shower and get ready to meet back up with her friends.  @NUM5 hours later, they all headed to they're hang-out spot, which they referred to as "the spot". They invited a couple of they're friends @PERSON6@NUM3, and @PERSON3@NUM7. They made a camp fire while the sun was setting because it grew to get colder, and colder. While @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON6 and @PERSON2 @CAPS1 sitting around the fire in chairs, @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 @CAPS1 riding around the camp site (which was really a huge hunk of @PERSON5 mom's land) on a quad. The group would take turns riding the quad but one ride in particular, made some memories. Once @PERSON5 and @PERSON4 came back, @PERSON2 wanted to give @PERSON4 a ride around. So @PERSON5 hopped off, and @PERSON2 hopped on, as @PERSON4 wrapped her arms around her waist, and they took off.  There was a certain trail where there was a long in the way of riding, so the driver would always have to find a way to maneuver around it. Usually it worked, this time it didn't. @PERSON2 hesitated to just ride right over it. She was afraid of all the power. @PERSON4 really didn't seem to care, and she took over and slammed on the gas. They high tailed it on the log and rolled the quad right over. @PERSON4 didn't weigh that much so she flew off, @PERSON2 on the other had got her foot caught under the handle. @PERSON4 got the strength to lift the quad off her foot, and @PERSON2 got right out. @PERSON4 decided to call the boys, and they hopped right into @PERSON1 to come save them. @PERSON5 flipped the quad right over and got on it and drove back behind the @PERSON1.  This memory will never be forgotten with in the group, even if the group will never be the same.

 the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 trip             I just woke up when I herd a laughing sorta noise from down stairs. I went down stairs and saw @PERSON2 , my  manger laughing with @PERSON1 one of my staff. she drove me and @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 time for the plane ride to @LOCATION1. I was scared because my dad jack died on a plane . i wont focus on that i m going to focus on this topic.When we landed that was the funnest of the ride :) the bumps in the @CAPS2 were so bumpy ,@CAPS3 we found our luggage and went to the shuttle were we drove to the hotel .We paid for the shuttle and went on our way to the hotel rooms ( i laughed at @LOCATION2 because he spill soda on his shirt ).@CAPS3 since we only had two day park hopper we had to stay at the hotel for the first day, for dinner we had food from a restaurant named chubby s it was the nastiest food I have ever had the fries were cold and the meat was not cooked all the way and there was no ice in our soda. the next day we got ready i wore a polo and some sunglasses and some shorts and the shoes I wore were converse (low cut ) what a really fashionable dont you think @CAPS4 ( laugh out loud )
<START>

 I moved to the @LOCATION4from @LOCATION5 with my family when I was just a child. We moved the small town of @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, where we have lived for @NUM1 years. Over the years there have been many difficult times, but we always managed to get through them by laughing together as a family.This past year has been especially trying, and I don't think we would have survived if we hadn't been able to celebrate the tragic time with laughter. My @CAPS2 stayed in @LOCATION5 when we moved to the @LOCATION1 because he was sick and didn't think he could survive the trip. Last year we finally convinced him to @CAPS3 up here with the rest of the family. He moved in with my family and shared my bedroom. It was hard because he snored and made strange noises in his sleep, but I was glad he was with us. When I would wake up tired from lack of sleep, I would just think about the funny noises and laugh.  Then, six months ago, my @CAPS2 was dianosed with a tumor in his brain. There was nothing the doctors could do for him, and they told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated and I couldn't stop crying. We asked @CAPS2 what he wanted to do. He said, "I want all of you to stop looking like I'm already dead and let's go have some fun!" That was just like @CAPS2. He said we were going on a trip to @LOCATION2 so he could go to @LOCATION3 before he left this world. I couldn't help laughing at how crazy he could be. Sure enough, when I arrived home from school the next @DATE1, @CAPS2 told us we had ten minutes to grab what we needed and get in the van. He had gone out and rented a @NUM2 passenger van for the trip so everyone in the family could go. We just stared at him. He started laughing and told said, "@CAPS3 it or you're staying behind!" I started laughing too, and hurried inside to pack. It was the best trip of my life. @CAPS2 told us all kinds of crazy stories about when he was a boy. Mom wrote some of them down so we could always remember them.  When we got to @LOCATION3 we went on every ride in the park. @CAPS2's favorite was @ORGANIZATION1. He wasn't supposed to ride it because of his condition, but he just laughed and said, "I"m sure it won't kill me." @CAPS4 though it made me sad when he said it, I still laughed because he was so happy. Two months after we went home, @CAPS2 died. @CAPS4 though it has been hard and I have cried about it often, I can't help but laugh when I think about that trip and how much fun we had. @CAPS2 taught me that laughter can make all the difference in turning any situation around.

The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends.  The incoming @CAPS11 were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS4 back some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our "@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the "main ingredient". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The "main ingredient" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid!  The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS7 photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have @CAPS16 up with something so clever.  After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother's from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother's were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, "@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @CAPS9 to make sure nobody had been hit. "@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren't killed that @CAPS8! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS9 in laughter and I had been laughing so hard that I began to cry. I've ever laughed so much or so hard in @CAPS3 life and I'll ever forget it.  Laughter @MONTH1 not have brought just two people together, but nearly twenty. When districts came and passed, I know everyone was sad to see the season @CAPS16 to a close. It was the @CAPS13 last season and nobody wanted to see them leave; but all the great times we had will never be lost, and bonds are @CAPS2.

                            Whats Laughter!How many friends do you really have? What relationships do you have with others? Well, I'm in high school and I usually don't have that many friends. But I have a few and one of my friends @CAPS4 friends with someone that I truly love. (@CAPS1 didn't know that) @CAPS2 year I was a freshmen and i went to the church with some of my friends and their was an @NUM1 grader that fell in the pond/water and I wasn't sure @CAPS20 @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 or not so I end up coming up to him and asked.Me; @CAPS4 you @CAPS3?, do you need some help?@CAPS1 said; @CAPS6, its @CAPS3 I just sprained my ankle.Me; @CAPS3, see you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS9 sure, @CAPS6 problem! The next year when I'm a sophomore I didn't realized that @CAPS1 was going to be their as a freshmen! his name is @CAPS11 I was starting to hang out with him more because @CAPS1 was really funny and sweet.  We went to the @CAPS12 ball together and our other friends were their but i was worried about of some stuffs but @CAPS1 made it butter because at that time i was afraid that my ex was their. @CAPS11 was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and their was a song that was on and I didn't realized that i was dancing until @CAPS1 told me that I was so after was dancing with him I end up asking him @CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends and @CAPS1 said a was able too so me and @PERSON1 ends up dancing and @CAPS1 was their when I needed him. We end up heading outside and I called @CAPS13 @CAPS14 to be picked up. So, in the mean time, we were outside waiting for her. We were laughing at some jokes that we @CAPS15 said to each other. Like one was that @CAPS1 @CAPS15 some thing in his @CAPS15 and acted like that it was a wand of some sort to the school building and @CAPS15 asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I end up sneaking up behind him and scared him so bad that I end up laughing and @CAPS1 was too. Because @CAPS1 usually doesn't get freaked out like that, and @CAPS1 told me that @CAPS1 is going to get me back and I'm starting to freak out from me not knowing what it @MONTH1 be. @CAPS11 is a great help when i need him!  The thing about laughter in life is that you would need eat ether way your upset or not in the mood.The main thing that was funny from my family is that we prank each other; like my sister would step out of the room and her soda is in the room that I'm in she still @CAPS15 about half of soda in the can their was mustard on the table and she hates mustard form the taste of it but my dad was thinking the same thing that I was wanting to do and that was to put a little bit of mustard in her soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at me also my @CAPS17. My sister ends up having some of the soda and she was looking at my @CAPS14 and was like;@CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS14 and myself was laughing and she hates mustard!, @CAPS20 it was something that I didn't like and that was put in my soda I would've done this too. So, mostly I'm trying to say is that their is some laughter that is funny. not all laughter is not funny. Its butter @CAPS20 you don't prank people that is close to your heart because they @MONTH1 get mad at you. Like my sister, @PERSON2 was mad at me when it wasn't me it was my dad's idea.

                The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the of day of @DATE1, I was turning @NUM1 years old and me and my best friend were at home, I called him seeing what he has planed for this nice sunny day and he told me he had nothing in mind, so we kept trying to think of something but for @NUM2 hours we had no luck. I called him again and we met up at a grade school and just sat down @CAPS3 a bench and started calling people to see whats up with everyone and no one would answer there phones. It became about @NUM3 pm when we stopped calling people to make planes, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat, I told him sure since we had no luck for a whole @DATE2 @TIME1. What sucks was that it was the @DATE2 of the @DATE3, and school was going to begin @CAPS3 @DATE4. So while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see whats up and whats happening.  We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty good, till we started hearing music bumping from a distance, so we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he told me he's going to go pick up lights for a @ORGANIZATION1 and I asked him who's all there and he told me that I need to see for my self. So we walked around the corner of the street we were @CAPS3 and saw the @ORGANIZATION1, we walked up to the door and saw are other friend who was standing at the door, we asked him where is everyone, we been bored all day with nothing to do @CAPS3 my own @CAPS1 and he told me that were here now and that's all that matters, so we walked in and saw everyone we called @DATE5 and more and they screamed @CAPS5 @CAPS1 to me and I was shocked why this @ORGANIZATION1 is for me and how did I get to my own @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 accident. I finally found out that it was planed for me the whole time, I guess that the flier by the restaraunt was put there @CAPS3 purpose and my friend was @CAPS3 this little @CAPS2 to get me to the @ORGANIZATION1 and it was all planed from the beginning of the day for people not to answer my calls or my friends but to get me to go buy some food and to find the flier and get me to go to my own @ORGANIZATION1 and I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get food to find my own @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 flier and we all had a good laugh, The @CAPS8!

 My @CAPS1, my friend, and myself were driving down the road on our way to pick up a mutual friend for youth group that night. Our conversation was anything but special. We were mainly just telling stories of fun times that we had already had with our old friend, and looking forward to making some new ones together. She was such an amazing person. Always ready to crack a joke, make new friends, and have a good time. Her smile was cute, and she was bale to talk someone into doing anything.  As we pulled up to her house, we were thrilled to be able to see her again. It had been weeks since the last "play date", and we couldn't wait to be able to catch up with her. She walked out her front door and trotted to our car. The smile on her face was enough to tell us that the feeling, of being reunited, was mutual. Getting out of the car we received bear hugs from her. Times of fun we had had together were flashing in my minds eye, and I was hoping that there would be many more that I would be able to look back on one day. We all got in the car, pulled out of her neighborhood, and started down the road. I realized that we were going the wrong way. "@CAPS1, we have to go back the other way, don't we?" I asked. "@CAPS2, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't let me make a @CAPS3 turn until up the street a little ways."she said. "@CAPS4, is that even legal?" I asked, knowing the answer would be no. "@CAPS5, I don't really have a choice now do I @CAPS6?" I could hear the sarcasm in her voice. She could make her voice and appearance sound and look mean, but I knew that in reality, she was just messing around with me. The barrier dissipated, and she was getting ready to make the @CAPS3 turn. Cranking the wheel she was barely able to clear the end of the barrier, but was to late to be able to stop in time to clear the curb on the other side. She accidentally backed up onto the curb making those of us in the back seat jump, and sway, from the impact. My friends and I were all laughing, knowing that she was usually very careful, and had good driving skills. "@CAPS8 everybody," she said. Her body language showing that she was having fun, but that she truly was @CAPS8 for giving us a jolt like that. Our reply was pure laughter. "@CAPS5, I guess that's our fun for the month," she said, her eyes sparkling with joy about making us laugh. She was always very quick to make jokes about situations we were put in.  She pulled forward, the back fender scraping the curb again as we drove off it. Driving away, my friends and I were still laughing , replaying what had just happened to us in our minds eye. It was one of our fondest memories together. A continual joke that we can just mention, and burst into laughter because of it. "@CAPS10 for the ride @PERSON1," my friends said as we got out of the car. We walked into youth group, laughing, knowing that this would be one of the many memories that we would cherish forever. Bringing us closer than ever before.

 My best friend @CAPS1 and I have known each other since we were two years old. We've helped each other through good times and bad, and are there for each other like chocolate on a bad day. @CAPS1's best quality is the fact that she can make me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. This year @CAPS1 decided to go to @ORGANIZATION4's, an all girls @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, instead of continuing on to @ORGANIZATION1 like me. The first day of @ORGANIZATION2, I could feel that something was missing. @CAPS1. Without her cackling laugh ringing down the hallways, it felt oddly quiet. It reminded me of a place where we made most of our hilarious memories, and where we were told to "shush" a fair amount too. Our little brick @CAPS3 church!  Most @DATE1's, I stood up on the alter with the priest and helped him prepare the bread and such. And most @DATE1's, my best friend @CAPS1 was in the pews. One particular @DATE1 I will never forget, @CAPS1 thought it would be funny to sit in the front row with my family and make faces at me all throughout the mass. See @CAPS1, she has the power to make you laugh just by smiling at you. When she makes faces, I usually and up with tears in my eyes. I was standing up in front of the whole congregation and was using every ounce of self control I had not to bust out laughing. The congregation must have thought I was really being changed by the @CAPS8 because I had the biggest smile on my face.  I'm sure you've been in one of those situations where it feels like it is physically impossible to stop laughing. You have to bite you lip, think about something sad, or try breathing excercises. Every time I glanced in her direction a new wave of giggles washed over me, and every time I glanced in my mom's direction, her evil eye burned brighter. After what felt like eternity, the choir sang the closing hymn and once we left the building, I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I had bitten my lip so hard that there were ridges indented on the inside of my mouth. Usually after church, we walk over to the @ORGANIZATION3 for coffee and doughnuts. We catch up on @ORGANIZATION2, and each others lives now that we don't see each other as often. She tells me about her new friends and I tell her about our old ones. I always look forward to hearing the hilariously stupid stories of her days, and I always inform her of the latest and greatest gossip from her hometown. But the thing that we always count on is a good laugh with a good friend.  Laughter keeps @CAPS1 and I close. If laughter really does add years to your life, we are probably going to be the two old ladies that live on the hill with twenty cats, and nobody really knows how old they are because they've been around forever. I can be myself around her and know that she accepts me because if I do something stupid I know she'll laugh and then we'll go play with her cat, @LOCATION2, or make popcorn and watch @ORGANIZATION2 three. My family must be tired of our never-ending inside jokes. When I laugh, it feels like liquid gold is bubbling in my stomach and everything is at peace in the world. It is one of the most comforting feelings in the world. That's what I feel when I'm laughing with my best friend @CAPS1.    
<START>

 Shafts of light escape through fogged windows casting a shadowed glare upon the surface of the table. A tremendous sign hovers on a wide oak shelf that borders the entire dining area. @CAPS16 read's "@CAPS1's" in great letters buried under decades of dust. My eyes dance among the plethora of mismatched antiques and statues strung throughout the room easily filling every crevice. These objects form a family of outliers, each individually unique belonging @CAPS15 the restaurant. Huge posters of All-@CAPS2 athletes tower among @NUM1-inch flat screens while an acrid scent of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Numerous bras fall from the ceiling of the bar that sits next @CAPS15 the entrance. The sound of crunching echoes in my ears as waitresses maneuver over fallen peanut shells. That's @CAPS4 sets this place apart from the others. The entire floor is littered with barrels of @TIME1's broken shells and mashed peanuts as @CAPS16 is custom for the customers @CAPS15 throw them on the ground. Of course there's my family; a vivacious group of five squeezing our round frames into a booth that comfortably seats four. We seem @CAPS15 mesh quite nicely with the crowd of miscellaneous objects dressed in our '@DATE1 @CAPS3' attire of skirts and dress suits.  Distracted, I busy myself in the menu browsing for something with a little zest and a lot of calories. A loud smashing noise breaks my attention and I slide the newspaper style menu below my eyes. Across the table sits my grandmother; a petite old lady standing proudly at @NUM2 who devotes her free time in attempting stand up comedy. I study the glass jar of ketchup she's holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut. The shell cracks open and @ORGANIZATION1 picks out the nuts sweeping its kernels onto the floor. I giggle @CAPS15 myself surprised at @CAPS4 limits this old lady is willing @CAPS15 go @CAPS15. She proceeds @CAPS15 repeat this process with ten more peanuts until the entire family has stopped in curiosity. Looking up, @LOCATION1 pauses with the jar suspended in her hand. "@CAPS4? I'm just trying new ways of cracking open the nut." @LOCATION1 exclaims pausing for a comical response. With no reaction we resume position contemplating our meal choices. Minutes later a hefty waitress reeking of drugstore perfume and @TIME1 nights hangover sets down glasses of water and drags off sluggishly. Raising his glass, @CAPS5 motions us @CAPS15 follow.  "@CAPS6!" @CAPS7 calls clinking each of our glasses in turn.  "@CAPS6! And @CAPS6 @CAPS15 cherry people!" @LOCATION1 pitches in. "@CAPS9 @CAPS10!" I shout automatically. Immediately my parents chuckle because my grandmother has never been funny. @CAPS16's a joke that nobody in the family laughs at @LOCATION1's comments but herself and that's how @CAPS16 remains. Years ago, my brother deemed her jokes the "@CAPS9 @CAPS10" because she poses as a comedian but truly isn't. From then on, each time @LOCATION1 would crack a "joke" someone was quick @CAPS15 respond with yelling "@CAPS9 @CAPS10!" @CAPS15 this day, she has neither improved nor given up daily opportunities @CAPS15 attempt @CAPS15 win over her audience. In quiet defeat @LOCATION1 chuckles @CAPS15 herself and focuses down on the menu. Seconds later she's back in the ring for round two.  "@CAPS16's noon. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have..brunch?! I'm dying here just laugh already," she pleads. For a moment we all just stare at her. Innocent eyes gaze back; the predator calmly sits awaiting the move of its prey. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, we eye each-other and the ribbon is cut. Tea party giggles erupt into hoarse cries as rolls of thunderous laughter echo through the room. I hand my mother a napkin which she uses @CAPS15 dab jubilant tears. The thick wooden table shutters under the pound of my father's fist slapping the surface in hysteria. I laugh so hard my gut aches and yet I cannot understand why everything is so funny. All the while @ORGANIZATION1 sits in pure delight, tickled by the success of finally earning a sincere response @CAPS15 her notorious off-the-cut "jokes." @CAPS16's a wonder we aren't thrown out of the restaurant. Customers in surrounding booths peer over the edge of their bench eying us with distaste. However, this isn't the first and certainly wouldn't be the @TIME1 time my family causes a scene. Plain yet obnoxious jokes is a loosely run comradery in our family that always finds its spot in our books of lasting memoirs. The remainder of the meal was spent in bursts of giggles and we were more than kindly shown out the door once our meal was finished.  Its when you break into hysterics for no monumented reason and can't get through retelling @CAPS16 someone else who doesn't find @CAPS16 nearly as humorous.) @CAPS16's those insignificant moments in life when we're reminded of who we are and the bonds we share. Laughter is a connection, a form of love that cultivates within society and in families with grandmothers such as mine, every "@CAPS9 @CAPS10" is worth @CAPS16.

 A long time ago, my family @CAPS6 I went to @LOCATION1 to see my great aunt @CAPS6 uncle. They had a log cabin right on the lake, with an @CAPS1 tepee in the back yard. They had a dock with a very big @CAPS6 nice boat. I had went with my @CAPS2, my other aunt @CAPS6 my two half sisters. I forgot why we went, but I think it was just because it was the @DATE2 @CAPS6 my great aunt @CAPS6 uncle were getting older. I was very young, @CAPS7 I only remember bits @CAPS6 pieces of the trip. I remember watching cartoons with my sister on the couch, watching "@CAPS3 @CAPS4" in our bedroom, having my sisters make me watch my first scary movie(I hate scary movies), going to a go cart track @CAPS6 driving for the first time, taking one of the extra little boats @CAPS6 going on the lake with one of my older half sisters, also taking the big boat @CAPS6 riding around the lake with my great uncle, he would turn in circles @CAPS7 that we would jump on the wave to make the ride more fun!  We get around to the @DATE1, @CAPS6 they where selling illegal fireworks all around the state for the event of course, but I remember sitting in the car with my two half sisters,@CAPS6 my @CAPS2 had gotten out of the car to go @CAPS6 get fireworks from a stand on the side of the road. We were all @CAPS7 tired from something, @CAPS7 we all stayed in the car. Outside the little stand where they sold the fireworks was this blow up balloon guy; you know one of those blow up looking things where it has a face on it @CAPS6 it doesn't stop moving @CAPS6 dancing? Anyways my oldest half sister starts saying "@CAPS5 look there he goes doing the macarana!' I had no idea @CAPS13 she was talking about until she pointed to the blow up guy who was just wiggling @CAPS6 springing to life every second.Then my other half sister joins in @CAPS6 starts saying "@CAPS6 now he's doing the mash potato!" @CAPS7 now I'm laughing because it's just @CAPS7 silly @CAPS6 funny, I actually thought he was dancing @CAPS6 doing all these dance moves! Now everyone in the car is laughing @CAPS6 giggling about something @CAPS7 silly @CAPS6 funny, I mean we were throwing out silly dance moves, some not even dances moves, just random objects! "THE @CAPS8!" "THE @CAPS9 @CAPS10!" "THE @CAPS11!" "THE @CAPS12!" we could not stop laughing! when my @CAPS2 got in the car she was like "@CAPS13!? @CAPS13 happened?!". I tried to explain to her @CAPS13 was @CAPS7 funny but she didn't get it. I guess you just had to be there to be a part of the ridiculous car stop at the side of the road where they sold fireworks to see why it was @CAPS7 funny!

 Laughter can be a very important thing in everyones life because, its something that can help you in many ways. As far as I remeber laughter has helped me get thru alot of emotional problems that I would have with alot of my ex boyfriends. One day my mom saw me crying because my ex had broken up with me and I got really upset so the only thing my mom said to me was that "laughter was the best medican"at that point I didn't understand what she was trying to say, but now that im getting older I start to realize what she ment with that is that being bummbed about something like that is just useless, and that I had to live my life to the fullest because I was to young to cry over someone who I jst had a simple crush on and she was totally right about that. But then again its not only for boyfriend and girlfriend thing it's also to keep a healthy friendship with your friends Laughter is a way to show how you feel inside. Even when I dont feel like laughing I still do because thats a way to show people that im a strong and independent girl who knows how to take care of herself and live her life. I also try to make the people around me laugh and just have a good time when we hang out because they create the best memories. I'm accually surprised in how much a simple laugh or smile can make someone feel better and sometimes one person can make another one smile just by simply laughing at the most siplest things.   In the other hand there are people who fake laugh meaning that they just laugh but its not that they are laughin because they think yewr funny they are laughin becasue they think yewr acting dumb. But the truth is that sometimes its hard to see whose the real people from the fake because there are many people who fake laugh just to pretend that they like you when they really dont and i truly think thats dumb because you end up beliving that they are your friends when all they do is laugh behind your back. But i dont let that get to me because those kind of people are the kind that its not even worth to take your time with .When i make the people that i care about smile and just have a good time also makes me happy because it makes me feel like i've made a difference in that certain persons day, i kno i cant change their life but I can always try to make their day a little easier by just making them laugh. My little three month old sister is always laughin, always cracking up for no apperant reason and its kinda funny to watch becasue when she laughs I laugh to, thats kinda what I ment to say when i say that a simple smile or laugh from one person to another can make a difference. i mean shes only three months ans shes always happy and always has a smile on her face for no reason, sometimes without knowing shemakes my day even better when she starts laughing out of the blue which i think its somewhat cute.  My mom sometimes tries to make laugh because she knows that I sometimes have bad days at school and she tries her best to make me laugh because when i laugh it makes me forget about al my problems and everything, but i know that laughin cant always be all good, for excample laughin at other peoples pain is just bad and thats something that isnt funny and people do laugh at other people which can really hurt someone. Meaning in many ways laughin can be good or bad but that also depends in the person who is laughin..

 I personally do believe that laughter is very important in any relationship. Who doesn't enjoy laughter every once in a while? I know i do. My true story is on the relationship of my @NUM1 year old toddler daughter and I. I will tell you why I think laughter is important, how it is important, the part it plays in my relationships, and the benefits I believe it can have for any persons relationships. Everyone needs to smile and just laugh, forget about the things that make you frown, so you can turn it upside down. My relationship with @PERSON1(my @NUM1 year old), has mixed emotions at all times, and is constantly changing. The emotions range from complete happiness and admiration, to anger, frustration, and a whole lot of stressfulness. Of course during all of these different feelings, I always love her with every inch of my heart. But during the midst of feeling so stressed out that I want to scream, she will say the funniest thing, or make the most adorable face. And you cant help but smile and laugh, which, let me tell you, makes all the difficulties go away for that brief moment. The most cold, angry, and hurtful people in the world, never laugh. They isolate themselves and don't have good relationships with other people. We all need some laughter in order to not be depressed and sad. If you are always frowning and stressing out, there wont be any room to look at the good things and just laugh. When @PERSON1 does her little thing and it makes me laugh, then she laughs and we are all in better moods. She knows that mommy still loves her, and she knows just the right ways to make me smile and i just wanna pick her up and squeeze her. Because at the end of the day, when you think about all the things that went on in your day, good or bad, there really isn't anything you can do but laugh.And that makes your whole day worth it. It doesn't have to be your children that make you laugh, it can be any relationship with anyone. Maybe its your relationship you have with your boyfriend, and you have been together for a long time, you guys laugh right? because honestly, how could you stand being with a person all the time, and saying you love them and what not, yet you never laugh with them? They never make you laugh? that just wouldn't add up..No relationship can really be a good one, unless there is some laughter. Especially if its someone that you love, and are with constantly. The good things in life, need to exceed the bad things. so, the more laughter the better. I know that parenting is super stressful, especially as a teen mom. and when she puts that smile on my face, i forget about my stresses for that moment and it makes everything better. I wanna give an example of when laughter really made a difference in my day, even my whole week. So you know when you have those days where nothing is going right, your arguing with your parents or boyfriend or whoever, and you have just been feeling like crap all day and week. You have not laughed, smiled, or done anything fun, because the past couple of days just seem to be dragging on and on with the same old routines. Then, the weekend rolls around, and i personally find a babysitter, and you go hang out with a friend or two. We all get together and start talking about old memories, both good and bad ones, ones that make you embarrassed, or ones that make you want to cry. But then you get to the story that always makes you bust up laughing, if its told the right way. And your all laughing for hours it seems(but really,its only been @NUM3 minutes ).Finally, your forced to stop laughing because you were laughing so hard you started crying. and your stomach hurts like you did fifty crunches, and it hurts so bad, yet you feel so good.Then we would all just lay there, catching our breathe. The only noise you hear is a little sputter of a laugh coming out of someones mouth every thirty seconds or so.. So, all-in-all, that's how I see laughter, and why I think its important in everyone's lives. When your sad, it will make you happy. And when your stressed out, it makes you forget everything bad, and just think about the good for a second. When you have had the worst week of your life it seems like, and then you finally get to have your weekend with the girls, and you laugh your heart out, you feel like a new person. Laughter is good for the soul, and it exercises some kind of muscle in your stomach too, I think. Doesn't really matter who you are, or what the issue, laughter will make you feel better, and forget the bad things.

                                       @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 wants to travel, and while traveling is fun, it is more exciting to go with people you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with people you @MONTH1 not know very well. Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 has an opportunity to go on a trip together. During these trips, the students are able to work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and just have a great time together. It's a experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of. At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION2. I was ecstatic to be going, but I'm an extremely introverted person and I knew that I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk, and was scared I would be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they would go across a street corner that didn't have a @CAPS5 dip down into the street, and thousands of other things that were racing through my mind. I was so terrified that that I would be separated from @PERSON3, my one friend who was in choir, that I almost didn't go. I'm not really sure how, but my mother convinced me that everything would be alright, and I had nothing to fear. Once we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split up into groups to see who wanted to go to explore the @PERSON7 and who wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true, I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I just kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I got on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @PERSON4, came to sit by me, and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we arrived at the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street we split yet again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to ride in one of the old trolleys up to the top then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep. I was forced to go on the trolley because the hill was so steep part of the sidewalk contained steps, and since I can't walk, the only alternative was the trolly. Several of the other kids went with us and once again @PERSON4 was in my group. A couple hours later, after getting lost and turning on several wrong streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid conversing with @PERSON4 this whole time, so the ride up the hill was enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be riding on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 on our ride.  There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperons, @PERSON6, and @PERSON5 raced back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me, alone, with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, who was the remaining chaperon. We walked leasiurly down the hill, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every so often they would ask me a question and I would answer in as few words as possible, and that's what was going on when we walked past a group of men, arguing, in front of a store and one of them yelled, "@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?" We didn't really know who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we just kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block @PERSON4 and I simultaneously broke into laughter. The man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses that I should have said to the man, each one being more hilarious than the last one, and as conversations go, we eventually got on different topics, which made me realize that @PERSON4 and I really did have many similar traits. We both loved musicals, we both enjoy reading, and we both have annoying, younger brothers. Ever since that day, @PERSON4 and I have been fairly good friends, all because we took a moment to laughed together.
<START>

 I believe laughter brings many different people together. In my friendships with friends we are always laughing about random, silly, things that happen to us each day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. One time when laughter help me out the most was the during fourth grade. Fourth grade had brought so many ups and downs with it which none of us knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fight over the littlest reason. This fight included my best friend @PERSON2, also my neighbor, @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We all were very close until this fight which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Everyone had their sides, @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2 and I was all alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't side with anyone they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @DATE2 and I because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew that and could not believe we had a huge fight. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 would try as hard as possible to hang out with both of us but somehow it didn't seem like that to @LOCATION1 and I. We both thought that @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 were never hanging out with us.  Soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember every other day someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would being going to see a councilor. @PERSON3 on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON1 remembers it "That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 or I remember talking but I guess change had start to come. When we went to the councler she was very nice and talked to us in a way we all felt comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing. We said that we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during the times we used to spend together, we answered yes. She let us play games, such as monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along. After school I went home and my mom asked me how the councling session had gone. I smiled and said we all had a blast! The next day the three of us went back to the councler and played more games. This session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, all of us read the paper to one another. All having the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future.  To most extent this message was very true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we simply say "don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times." In most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs and along with those comes laughter or crying. In the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends. They are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key.

Benefits of laughter Laughter has always been a big part of my life. when you laugh you are having fun. Having fun puts you in a good mood. When my friends and I get into arguments, or disagreements laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits like working out your core, and lungs. One of my best friend's mom recently passed away right before @CAPS1. Her name was @CAPS2. She was like a second mother to me for several reasons. I had known her for @NUM1 years, and for a small amount of time i even lived at her house. She was basically a mother figure to me, because i don't live with my birth mother. I use to see her almost everyday, because of my friend @PERSON1. He is @NUM2 and we hang out just about every day. I remember the morning he called me and told me his mom was dead on the floor in her bedroom. I ran over there as fast as i could when i saw the ambulance lights. My other friend @PERSON2 spent the @TIME1 at @PERSON1 house the @TIME1 his mom died. When i made it to @PERSON1's house he instantly started to cry on my shoulder. It was wise not to try and make @PERSON1 happy with laughter, because nothing is really funny when a loved one passes away. As time went on @PERSON2 and I started to think of ways to cheer up @LOCATION1. We wanted to get his mind off of his mother. Wouldn't you know it the best way to do so was laughter. I'm the jokester in my group of friends. So some how i have the ability to make people laugh without thinking. I'm more of a doer not a thinker. Id rather see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood there is this bad aura or vibe you can just feel it. Its a very undesirable feeling. Laughter cheers up my friends when they are feeling down. Laughter helped make a bad situation like my friends mom dying into a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter along with trust, and respect are @CAPS3 bring my friends and I together.

                                 @CAPS2 @CAPS1      The first time i ever heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was the beginning of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but i wasn't really sure about it. Though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it. I had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school. But when i got into high school my opinion of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was much more then i expected, the people, and the attitudes i realized that if i were to play on the high school volleyball team i wouldn't have any fun. So i started to look into joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team. I had finally decided to sign up and join the team. I had really hope i would like @CAPS2 @CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it.          The first day of practice, after school i went into the girls locker room, changed and took everything with me and went out to the track shed. When i got out there, i saw a lot of people i had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach @PERSON1 started to talk to everyone that was new to @CAPS2 @CAPS1. She told us that it would be a great experience and it was a a great sport and also it was more of a individual sport rather than a team sport. But also we did many things as a team. After she had talked and discussed the basics of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. We we're to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we were to start our run for the day and everyday was a different work out either a road run or a track work out. I began to really enjoy @CAPS2 @CAPS1. At first, i was beyond sore and couldn't move at all. But as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day. We trained and got ready for my first race which made me very nervous i had no idea what to expect my first race ever and i was so scared and nervous. But after, i had ran my first race ever i felt good and was proud of myself. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is something i have always loved every since my freshman year when i first started to run.      One of my most favorite races we've ever done was called "@CAPS5 @CAPS6" the first time i ever ran in that race was my freshman year, it was like of our third or fourth races of the season. It also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years. So i was excited for it because i had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that i would love it, the day of the race i was once again nervous like every other race I've been too and still am every since i first joined @CAPS2 @CAPS1. When we arrived at the destination we set up a tent, started to warm up for the each of the races that was going to happen a boys race and a girls race. We also went over the course and that's when i realized what everyone was telling me the mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to @CAPS2 a river twice. After the race, i had such a great time my team and i laughed and we all enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, our bus rides as a team, all the fun practices. As a team we enjoyed many laughs and all the fun times we've had together. My favorite year of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season, i loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 we laughed and enjoyed each others company as we practices and also as we were on bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun, and laughed often as a team and that to me was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is a big part of running and having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without laughter our team would not be as happy,excited, or even ready to practice. Laughter is big in @CAPS2 @CAPS1 without it our team would not have as much fun as we've had over the years.

 One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1 what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the "right time." @CAPS1 one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS1 still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1 a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS1 you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem.  After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS1 I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS1 muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS1 because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS1 it's still something that could make your whole day better.

All Of us now how to laugh and all of us probably have laughed at least once in our entire lives. But I never laughed as hard as I did the day my friend @CAPS1 and I were waiting for our friends @LOCATION1, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 to come back from getting @PERSON3 from @LOCATION3 to come down and hang out for a little while. @PERSON1 had to wait at my house for them to get back, on the way to my house I'm thinking what in the world am I supposed to do with @CAPS1 all alone? @PERSON1 and I always have a lot of fun hanging out with each other but we always have people around when we do hang out, I anticipated when @PERSON1 got there cause I couldn't think of what me and @PERSON1 could do when we were at my house with out @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 being there. We couldn't hang out in the house because my @CAPS3 had a cold, so we had to go outside in to the shop which is also called a garage, and hang out together until @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 got @NUM1 finally showed up and I didn't feel as sick as i thought that I would when she got there, she got out of the car and came in, we went straight to the shop and got started on trying to find something to do, @PERSON1 suggested that we sat down and just talked, I was up for anything as long as it was fun and didn't involve going anywhere at @NUM2: @NUM3 @CAPS4 clock at night. I sat there and asked her about her life was she happy, did she hate living in @LOCATION2 and a lot of other stuff. but then the ultimate topic of conversations came up... T.V. commercials. we talked about all of our favorite @CAPS5 commercials and why they were our favorite, I told her my favorite commercials of all time were the freecreditreport.com commercials, the old ones not the new ones, and that the reason i loved them so much was because they had real life situations in them that made them very easy to believe but they were also sort of hard to believe cause i don't know anyone who has had to work at a restaurant dressed as a pirate because of identity theft, or someone who has had to buy a really cruddy car because their credit score was whack, and I've also never heard of a used sub compact? Any-who @CAPS1 said that her favorite commercial was a car commercial that had dancing hamsters in it telling you which car would be the best choice to go with, @CAPS1 was describing the commercial to me and actually started dancing in the middle of my garage. It was quite funny but at the same time some what disturbing. @PERSON1 is a really good friend even if she is a little goofy sometimes but the best thing about having @CAPS1 is knowing that when ever i need a really good friend i have @CAPS1 after the whole dancing bit i knew what i wanted to while @CAPS1 was there... I wanted to be crazy and hyper I wanted to be so full of energy the world fastest runner wouldn't be able to keep up with me! I went into the kitchen and downed some sugar and got about as hyper as @CAPS1, only less, then the time almost flew by before we knew it @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 were there we couldn't believe it. @PERSON3 got out of the car and the first person he gave a hug to was @PERSON1 of course, then he gave me a hug, then @PERSON4, then @PERSON2. I hadn't seen @PERSON3 in so long it was like we had never met before. @CAPS1 showed everyone her dance and the song, everybody laughed so hard i thought they were gonna pass out I had a lot of fun that night mostly because of @CAPS1, she was very nice she was funny and she kept me thinking about other things then what was on my mind at the time @CAPS1 was a big ball of hyper that night, I thought that it was funny. We were just standing there in the shed and she goes "mouse" and I scream and jump up on to a chair and scream "@CAPS14!" @CAPS1 reassures me that it was in the rafters and couldn't come down and get us so for the rest of the time we just acted like he wasn't even there I'm really lucky to have @CAPS1 and I'm really glad for the day i worked up enough courage to go over and say hi to her that day in art cause other wise id be lost @PERSON1 is the best friend a girl could ever ask for and I was fortunate enough to get her for my best friend. She is smart funny and talented and I would miss her if she were gone @CAPS17 really glad she moved down here from port orford.

I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE1, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE2 time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was sweet, @CAPS2 I though, until one @DATE2 day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling "let go of her lead!" @CAPS2 me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS2 as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughing has helped me a lot in life because it brings me up when I am feeling down.

Laughter is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS6 frustrating when you can't manage to get someone to laugh? Is @CAPS6 really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile? There's something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes @CAPS6 just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what @CAPS6 is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay. Last @DATE1, I was babysitting, @CAPS6 was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION1. At the time I could not legally drive anybody outside of my family, so we decided to call my sister, @LOCATION1. She had the day off work, so @CAPS6 seemed to be a perfect day for frostys. We waited for what seemed like forever for @PERSON2 to get to the house and finally, after about an hour, she pulled in the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded into the back of @CAPS4 car and off we went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there, we started getting out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON2 had just locked the keys in the car, with the keys still in the ignition and the car running! I was still getting the kids out of the car so you'd think that I would just reach in and grab them, but no, that was not the case here. I asked @PERSON2 "@CAPS3 did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to get your keys?" @CAPS4 response was, "@CAPS5, no! I locked @CAPS6 too! Don't close your door!" @CAPS6 was too late. I instinctively closed the door after i was done. I hadn't really thought about the fact that I could have saved all of this from happening, especially considering that I was the one that noticed @CAPS6 first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after I ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't figure out what was so funny. Then @CAPS6 hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION2's parking lot with three kids, locked outside of a car that was running and we didn't really know what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and have @CAPS4 bring the spare @CAPS1, but we weren't really sure where the spare @CAPS1 was at the time. My mom said that she didn't have @CAPS6 so we would have to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS6 was. We called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid, but then said the @CAPS1 was in his truck and somebody would have to come get @CAPS6 from him because he was about to go into a meeting. Obviously we couldn't go get @CAPS6 from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS6, though at this point she wasn't very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us to not worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @CAPS6 with @CAPS6 locked, and just go inside @PERSON1's and get our frostys. Through all of this @PERSON2 and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy role playing me closing the door while @PERSON2 said not to. They thought @CAPS6 was hilarious. @PERSON2 and I were not so humored by @CAPS6, although we did think @CAPS6 was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again. Instead of us making the kids laugh, they were making us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION2's for almost two hours before my mom showed up with the @CAPS1. @CAPS6 turned out that the @CAPS1 was not in my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS6 was at our house, hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys. That didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mom showed up with us not there. The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day, neither was @PERSON2 blaming me for everything and making me fill @CAPS4 tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting. The funny part was the kids. Still today, they laugh about our little @PERSON1's adventure. @CAPS6 just makes me realize that @CAPS6's all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone. I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day, even if they think @CAPS6's the worst day ever. Laughter really is the @CAPS1.

 Laughter is a huge part oh building friendships, relationships, and partnerships. Laughing is the first thing you learn to do you are born knowing how to laugh its the only thing that you are born to know how to do. Laughter for me is what starts a friendship if I can make someone laugh we are already closer then when we first said "@CAPS1". As an example when I started working at the daycare i am at now when I got the other teachers to laugh you can just tell its there way of excepting you as part of there crew.  On the first day of work I walked in the the daycare nervous they sent me to the preschool classroom. I am pretty sure my boss could tell I was nervous and it made me laugh. It made me feel welcome to be there and like we could be friends. The children in that class room made me laugh the things they did. well working with children you find out if you can make them laugh or if you laugh at there jokes they are more inclined to trust you and with that you can make them feel comfortable around you. Having someones trust is sometimes hard to get but if you get it from the very beginning its easy to keep but also very easy to lose. When someone is down in the dumps making them simply laugh can make everything better laughter is like medicine in makes you feel better when nothing else can. Its safe to say making people laugh comes natural to I am just good at it and jokes come easily. When you laugh it makes everything better. Laughing is actually health and is a form of excursive.  When I am at work and kids laugh it makes me feel better even if I am having the worst day ever. When I am around people that are happy it makes me feel alot better about myself. Its even better when its babies that laugh becasuse they are so cute when they do it.

Laughter, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on an @CAPS3 @DATE1 @CAPS4  One of my favorite @DATE1 traditions is the visit to the house of our @CAPS2, the @CAPS5. They live on eighty forested and meadowed acres outside of a quaint, old town. Their small green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees forming a backdrop.  We arrive midmorning. We either find our @CAPS2 in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws and other trailbuilding implements in their hands. After the customary hello, how have you been, we often wander around the yard, exclaiming at the new fruit trees or hearing stories about the latest tenants of the birdhouses.  During the hottest part of the @CAPS4, we head for the shade of the lush @ORGANIZATION1 woods. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love walking among the sun-streaked ferns and fallen logs, treading carefully the rickety bridges over burbling streams, bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges, and trying to avoid the dogs as they galumph in and out of the water. @PERSON2 knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant stream of knowledge as we hike. He also, of course, has to tell us about the trees he's planted -- a redwood here (look how well it's doing! A foot since last fall!) and a douglas fir over there (not as well. That big redwood is shading it too much). One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead-end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago. We always walk to the end of it and discuss where it could go from there -- over the stream or beside it, or up the hill and if so, where would the switchbacks be? could you really bike up a trail like that?  After our walk, we arrive back at the house, sweaty and talkative. Then it's time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond! They recently built a dock that we can jump off of -- a great improvement over wading in from the edge. We swim for the majority of the @TIME1, racing from one end of the pond to the other, splashing on innertubes, having pondweed-throwing battles. Finally we get tired and sit by the side of the pond, drying off in the warm sun.  By @TIME1, dinner is ready. Laura usually makes salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. We drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper. From the hill, we can see turtles and birds on the pond, bugs over the fields, and more birds swooping through the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs. After the meal, we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the @TIME2.  @PERSON2's favorite part of the @CAPS4 is at dusk, when the sun is at just the right angle to show all the bugs swirling through the air. At one point, all the bugs gather together and create a tornado, twisting upwards into the darkening sky, and then -- they're gone, until the next @CAPS4. It's an incredible spectacle; thousands of tiny insects disappering at one swoop.  The best thing about these days is the friendship and comradery we have with this wonderful family. The parents knew each other long before us kids were born, so we have a lot to talk about; @PERSON2 is very interested in science topics, and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read. And, as with all great @CAPS2, we laugh constantly. I consistently get hiccups at least three times just when we're lounging on the porch after our busy @CAPS4. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or the @PERSON1 boys can find a joke to make, usually "politically incorrect" but always very funny.  Now don't even get me started on the @DATE1 camping trips, winter ski trips or autumn cider pressing we do with the @CAPS5.

                                      Misunderstood "@CAPS1 the heck is her problem," is @CAPS1 I thought as I glanced over and @CAPS7 gave me @CAPS15 nasty look. @CAPS27 obviously thought the new girl was weird. @CAPS7 @CAPS24 had @CAPS15 killer look in her eyes. I observed the way @CAPS7 glared at @CAPS27 in the room, and how her facial expression never changed. "@CAPS2 huh," my cousin, @PERSON1, asked while staring at @CAPS3, who was, of course, the new girl. I glanced over at @CAPS3 and then back at @LOCATION1. "@CAPS5 on! @CAPS11 can say @CAPS26! @CAPS7 can't hear us," @CAPS7 whispered. @PERSON1's whispers weren't exactly as quiet as @CAPS7 thought. @CAPS3 could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced over at her again, and I noticed behind those cold eyes, @CAPS7 seemed kinda lonely and sad. I guess @CAPS26's possible, @CAPS7 has been the talk of the whole @NUM1 grade class since @CAPS7 arrived about @NUM2 days ago. "@CAPS6 hello! Taylor? Are @CAPS11 there?" @CAPS7 was now in my face and view of @CAPS3.  "@CAPS7 does look @CAPS2 on the outside, but maybe @CAPS7 is actually a nice person," is @CAPS1 I said, but I knew @CAPS15 would not satisfy @PERSON1 at all. "@CAPS1? Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to some mafia or something. @CAPS7 gives off that type of aura." "@CAPS11 shouldn't judge someone @CAPS31 their looks," I responded. @PERSON1 gave me @CAPS15 sort of confusing look. "I mean, @CAPS11 never know unless @CAPS11 ask."  "@CAPS12 if your such the expert on @CAPS26 why don't @CAPS11 go sit with her at lunch, and ask her." @CAPS13 man. There was @CAPS29 way I could possibly do that. I know I @CAPS24 said not to judge someone @CAPS31 their appearance, but @CAPS7 looks like if I even open my mouth to speak to her @CAPS7 will kick me in the shins. @CAPS1 a predicament @CAPS15 is. "@CAPS14't @CAPS11 the one who wants to get to know her? @CAPS11 ask." @CAPS15 one won't @CAPS31 past @PERSON1 either. "@CAPS16? @CAPS29 way. We already decided @CAPS11 were going to ask. @CAPS11 can't @CAPS5 back with the same thing," @CAPS7 argued. @PERSON1 is a very stubborn girl, and though @CAPS7 likes to pick on me, @CAPS7 really is a nice person. Also, despite her obnoxious exterior @CAPS7 has a lot of friends, unlike myself who is shy.  "@CAPS17," I muttered. I had to give in. @CAPS29 matter @CAPS1 I say, I am going to have to face @CAPS3.  "That's @CAPS1 I thought. @CAPS26's a good opportunity to make a new friend. I am @CAPS24 helping @CAPS11 out." @CAPS7 had @CAPS15 mischievous grin on her face. I glanced over at @CAPS3 one last time, and then at the clock. @CAPS26 was @NUM3 in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I am nearsighted, but lunch is at @NUM4.  I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch. Maybe @CAPS7 isn't mean, maybe @CAPS7 is actually nice, and people are @CAPS24 misunderstanding, including me. That aside, I don't even know @CAPS1 to say; I can't @CAPS24 casually walk up, sit down in front her, look her in the eye, smile and say "@CAPS21. How are @CAPS11?" The impossible is @CAPS24 impossible and people should @CAPS24 except @CAPS26, in fact @CAPS26 should actually be a fundamental law. I looked over at the clock again, @CAPS26 was now @NUM5 and still ticking. "@NUM6 minutes," @PERSON1 said in some type of singing tone. I sighed. "@CAPS22? I kept watching @CAPS11 during class. Looked like @CAPS11 were going to jump through that window and run away at any second." @CAPS7 laughed. My seat was @CAPS31 the window, and that option had not slipped my mind. "I have @CAPS29 clue @CAPS1 I am going to say," I finally said.  "@CAPS24 say anything that won't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or @CAPS1 @CAPS7 likes. Talk about school even," @CAPS7 replied. "@CAPS26's time. Go." @CAPS27 piled out of the class room and in to the cafeteria. After I got my lunch, I started walking toward the table @CAPS3 was at; @CAPS29 one was around her, @CAPS29 surprise there.  "@CAPS6, @MONTH1 I sit here," I asked. My voice was kinda shaky and I thought I was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at @CAPS1 @CAPS7 said. "@CAPS31 all means, go ahead," @CAPS7 smiled. Wow, @CAPS7 is really cute when @CAPS7 smiles. I smiled back and sat down. I created a conversation @CAPS31 introducing myself and asking how @CAPS7 was and how @CAPS7 liked @CAPS15 school. To my surprise we actually shared a common interest, and bonded. @CAPS7 was laughing. I was laughing. We were laughing together.  After that day, and even still today we are the best of friends. That slight feeling of laughter is @CAPS24 so nostalgic, @CAPS26's almost indescribable. @CAPS24 something so minor such as laughter, or even a little giggle, can bring anybody together to form a simple bond, friendship. Laughter is truly an essential part of life.

 It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. "@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON3!" We heard @PERSON2 scream as @PERSON1 and I walked into my room. "@CAPS1 boy." I thought, "@CAPS3 we @CAPS7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS3 at the same time." @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS28 head.  "@CAPS4, @CAPS22 happened this time?" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS7 at each other the way @CAPS29 were. "@CAPS4!" I finally yell. "@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're going to do. You," I pointed to @PERSON3, "@CAPS7 and sit over there." @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. "@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?" I looked at each of them, @CAPS29 nodded in response. "@CAPS9, @CAPS14 lets @CAPS7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game." I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. "@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 just a comical genius?" @PERSON2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. "@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON2!" @PERSON3 said laughing. "@CAPS14 who's calling who crazy?" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON2 had on @CAPS28 game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON1 and whispered, "@CAPS1 this is not going to be pretty." We started preparing for the worst. "@CAPS17 grab @PERSON3's arm and drag @CAPS28 if you have to, out of this room." @PERSON1 jumped to @CAPS28 feet and got @PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 to my bed. When @CAPS29 had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS28 up but kept myself between @CAPS28 and the door. "@CAPS4, @CAPS22 is going on with you two?" I nervously asked @CAPS28.  @PERSON2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. "@CAPS4 @CAPS22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before." @CAPS20 started flowing down @CAPS28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  "I...I don't know @CAPS22 h..happened." @PERSON3 said still weeping. "I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha..happened today." @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS22 happened that we missed.  "@CAPS22 did you mean when you said @CAPS22 happened today?" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS15 @CAPS28 response. "@CAPS23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. "@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3." All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @PERSON3. "@CAPS4, this is pointless. @CAPS23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS29 just make things more complicated anyway." I looked to both of them, @CAPS20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. "@CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget?" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. "I'm @CAPS23 sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?" @CAPS28 face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 to reply. "Of course I forgive you." @CAPS29 hugged with @CAPS20 still streaming down their faces. All was well again.
