When are they coming! When are they coming! I'm visiting my family at @CAPS1 and my cousins are playing coming in from @LOCATION1. I'm so excited, so impatient, I can't wait until they stop in the black car and I can give them a hug and be an eye-opener. It was about lunchtime and I was eating cold pizza while looking out the window. I count down from ten and say they'll be here at @NUM1, but they're never theirs. Soon I realized it was about @NUM2 pm, and knowing I won't see them until tomorrow, I'll be patient so I don't waste a whole day thinking about it. After a good night's sleep, I got up for breakfast and watched some @CAPS2. @PERSON1! @PERSON1! Sing! Sing! Is it really not? It can't be Uncle @CAPS3 and his big motorcycle. Hours later, I heard @PERSON1 again saying that @CAPS3 uncle might be leaving, but then I flew my cousins @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5 out of their chairs and gave them a hug for their day. I think patience is really the key.
The time someone was patient with me was when I was younger and my sister now teaches me to braid. It took a long time and my little hands didn't always correct things. But my sister always helps me whenever she has time. I thought I would never do it right. When she told me the phrase "practice makes perfect", she asked me to choose from her best choice of strings. She slowly thought about how to do it. Before I knew it, my knitting was as good as hers. I'm glad she encouraged me to keep trying and she's been patient with me. This is an example of someone being patient with me at one time.
It was hard to wait for one time, but I was patient and finally @CAPS1. Once my family and I were going to @CAPS2 world. I woke up in the morning so excited because I really wanted to go to the airport to go to the @CAPS2 world @CAPS4 We packed into the car we drove to the airport. In the car, my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. As soon as we got to the airport, we were excited for dinner! Are you waiting for your plane when we arrive in the area, the staff told everyone who is on the same plane as us that the flight to @LOCATION1 will be delayed by about an hour. My whole family and I really want to get to the @ORGANIZATION1 world ASAP, but we'll just have to wait as we walk around the airport and grab a bite to eat. And then @CAPS4, we just have to wait another twenty minutes! My family and I just sat and chatted and before we knew it we were on the plane. Patience can really help solve problems.
@DATE1 is my birthday and I just switched to @NUM1. I am very happy! ! ! Well, my mom was at work while I was having fun and my big sisters were getting ready for my party. We had everything at the party like juice, soda, food, candy, chips, ice cream, but no cake. My mom was supposed to pick it up when she got off work. Then it's time to open the gift. After we opened all my presents, it was time for cake and ice cream. We had ice cream but no cake, but I didn't cry and scream like a baby, my sister did, but she's still @NUM2, I'm @NUM1, and I have to play @NUM1 years old. My mom called to tell us she was running a little late and would be here when she got my cake. When my mom came home we cut the cake and when I took my first bite I said to myself it was worth the wait! I'm glad I waited like a big kid, but I'm even more glad I'm @NUM1!
I'm usually always patient, but I'm most patient when my baby sits @DATE1. I'm babysitting with my cousin @PERSON2. We babysit four-month-old twin girls for eight hours! Let me tell you, babies have a lot of work and you need to have a lot of patience with them. The time of day you need to be patient with them is when they cry. These babies cry a lot and cry for a long time, so it takes a while for them to calm down. Like when I sat a twin down and it fell asleep it would start screaming and I would patiently take my time to calm them down. Another thing I used my patients for that day was to put them to sleep. It took a while for my primary care baby to fall asleep. So I walked patiently around the house, bouncing her up and down on my arm. Of course, eventually they all fell asleep. The third time I patiently fed them. See they are very small twins, so they eat for a long time. Likewise, when I feed a baby in my care, I have to be patient not to freak out when she vomits on my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin was patient when "her baby" @PERSON3 spat at her too. It took a lot of patience that day, but it was still fun: you can see @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 have a lot of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1 through.
Patience is a very long task @CAPS2, and the reward will be weighed against how long you wait for what you're waiting for. From waiting for the computer to boot up to queuing to the roller coaster, your patience will be rewarded. However, many people are not very patient. (@CAPS1 me) @CAPS2 Over time they can learn to be patient like a monk. In short, be patient with @CAPS1.
Once when I was little we were going to the dentist at ann-@CAPS1 and there was a lot of traffic and my sister and brother were in the car (we ended up waiting @NUM1 hours) I was really unhappy so my mom Tell me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I do. That means waiting and staying calm. When I go to the dentist and sit down. I found out I was running late so we had to go home and do it again tomorrow.
When I have the patience is when I go to Cedar Point. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and it was a long journey. When we got there, there was a long queue. My mom said "okay guys just be patient". Once we got in, we went to the first escape we saw. It also has a very long line. "If we want to ride all the rides, we're going to have to be patient all day," Mom said.
Have you ever had patience? I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. This happened at his friend's house on a hot @DATE1 day. When my brother broke his finger, he seemed to be @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hands and his knuckles and all the things moms do all the time. It seemed like it took a long time to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. On the third day of the accident, my mom called the doctor's office to make an appointment for my brother. I thought ok I'd stay home while he went to the doctor, but there was one person who got in his way and she was mom. She said I have to go to the doctor with her and my brother even if I don't want to. After that day, I kept selling my mom the excuse that I couldn't go, but she wouldn't buy it. So after a short drive, what seemed like a long ordeal, we waited in the waiting room. In that waiting room, we've been waiting, waiting, waiting, and if you said wait, you guessed it. In waiting, seconds are confused with minutes, and minutes with hours. Those "hours" of torture made the ride look like a kitten. There is no entertainment to distract those brutal minutes from being so slow. If the snail quickly imagines that it is six times slower, you will begin to understand how slowly time flies. Finally, after we waited so long, the doctor came into the room and asked my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is more boring. The doctor sat down and kept talking in words so much that @CAPS1 looked tiny. I'm so tired I don't care anymore. It was finally time to warm up and no one was happy except me. I am happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to the doctor. The doctor's office is very boring. I was patient and I ended up leaving the doctor's office. Sometimes patience pays off. My reward is being able to leave the doctor's office.
One time at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I got some arrows but no one came to get my arrows. So instead of ringing the bell a hundred times, I waited there quietly and patiently. I waited about @NUM1 minutes for someone to come and when someone did they said thank you for being so patient and called me so I could leave. That's when I have patience.
Once I was in line for lunch. I was because there were a lot of other people in line and someone asked others to cut them, so the line was getting longer. That's a story I once had.
Once I have the patience? ? ? Is my dad going to send me a @CAPS1 gift. I'm just waiting, waiting for it. While I'm waiting, I'm just with mine? ? ? The day I slept, yes, playing games, asking for lessons, watching TV, and two weeks later I learned, it was @ORGANIZATION1 when gaming and a hundred bucks, I called my dad and said thank you for playing my games all night, Save my hundred dollars for my birthday. That's when I was drawing
As I walked down the alley looking for the perfect gift I saw the day before. I found it was sold out. Today is my mom's birthday and I found a gift. The perfect gift for a statue of precious moments. I asked the manager if there were any facts behind it, sadly they didn't. "The new shipment should arrive at five," he said. I don't think I can wait another three hours. My dad drove me home. I paced back and forth thinking it would occupy sadly it didn't. Finally I realized I needed to relax and be patient before. I knew that if it was five o'clock, my dad and I would be back at the store in no time with the perfect gift right in front of me. I picked it up and gave it to the clerk to scan. I handed her the money and headed straight home. When Mom got home, I handed the gift to Mom and realized that the patient would come in handy while waiting.
One day we drove to @ORGANIZATION1 for a very special event to meet @LOCATION1, @PERSON1's President of the United States, and when we arrived at the park where we were going to meet him, there was a car parked a mile away! When we finally parked, we started walking, it was a long walk, but when we finally got to the door, I was so excited! After we went through security, we never got there though. I stood there with my parents, and I thought about it for about two hours, until finally everyone dispersed, watching where the national anthem was being sung, and the president came up to the podium and made a speech. It's the longest line I've ever been on and I'm very patient.
I was at a baseball game at @LOCATION1 the other day and the line was long and stretched for half a mile and we came to the end. So it took us about an hour to get there, so I had to be very, very patient or my dad would go crazy, so that's my story about patience.
Only @NUM1 minutes of class left and I have @CAPS1 to do. So I watched the clock tick, so slowly. @NUM1 mins @NUM3 @NUM4 At @NUM5, the teacher asked, "What are you doing?" I said, "@CAPS1. I have @CAPS1 to do" "Why don't you bow your head?" I lost my patience and wanted to Clap clap, but no. I bowed my head, and the next thing I knew, it was time to go. I was patient and had no trouble.
Did you know that the patient is one of the keys to happiness. For example, I was walking and this guy @CAPS1 came up. Started talking to me about his family (just remember I wasn't very patient at the time.) @CAPS1 He kept talking until I snapped "Shut up you know what"! Too bad he said "yes" @CAPS1 ran home. crying. @CAPS1 I went home and when I got home I felt sorry for that person and @CAPS1 said "sorry". ! For some reason he said "got you" and I said "what" I was pissed but when it was over I was happy. But it taught me a lesson to always be patient because you don't know who's watching, literally.
I'm always patient with my family, my mom and @CAPS1 do a lot for me and the fans, they're always patient if they go somewhere. Sometimes my mom and @CAPS1 take me to play hockey. hockey. My @CAPS1 usually needs it, but on @DATE1 my mom needs me and I'm patient. I'm always patient when it comes to homework, if I go to @PERSON1's golf course and my mom says she's going to, I'm always patient.
patience. my cousin? ? ? The most patient person I have ever met. @LOCATION1 is studying to be a doctor and he has to finish eight years of university. Eight years of terminology, teaching cells, and studying human anology, he had to be patient. My cousin went to @ORGANIZATION1 which is close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home often and never complains about homework or school or anything with the highest patient? ? ? Believe me. He is the perfect example. Romeo was in his fifth year of college, which meant going around. Aside from the fact that he squeezed him, he didn't have some way of reducing the pressure? ? ? Not easy to be motivated and relaxed? ? ? this way. Before he went to @ORGANIZATION1, he told me that patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo is very patient.
This is a story of patience, in my own way @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of @CAPS1. "@CAPS4, come get my shoes?????? And I don't want to be late for school anymore". I yelled at my @CAPS4 "@CAPS1" and @CAPS4 said in a jerky voice, you asked me a second ago, it doesn't take a second to find a lost shoe, just be patient. " I know, I know, I sigh, but I still don't want to be late." "I know, but remember, patience will get you far." " @CAPS6" I agreed. So @CAPS3 remembered her mom's words at school @CAPS1 and was very patient with all @CAPS3. She didn't complain to her friends about the slow bus to school, she didn't let Her friends line up for lunch to get food faster. At the gym, she doesn't grab the volleyball when someone puts it on their shoes so she doesn't get kicked, she just stands there. By the end of @CAPS3, @LOCATION1's friends also started acting like her. Their teachers noticed how patient they were when they raised their hands instead of saying the answers out loud. By the end of that session, They all got some candy. Other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1's next class she could feel everyone's eyes on her, but she knew it was there And for good reason. Everyone learned to put their hands up and not push when they left the classroom. Soon everyone started getting candy, and the teachers were happy! When I got home from @CAPS3, I worked really hard to put my @CAPS4 Zoomed in, and then I told her what happened at school. I've learned to be patient ever since.
The day I support free @CAPS1 chips. When I'm at @ORGANIZATION1, they give away @CAPS1 chips for free I'm number @NUM1 @CAPS2 When I'm in front of @CAPS3 @NUM2 friends @NUM3 This is our giveaway day to complete the @CAPS4 tier. I'm a scroll patient, I spent four @NUM4 hours and @NUM5 minutes, we ate a chip, and left, we entered the liaret geme, we were so tired, we were going to @LOCATION1, here's my @CAPS5 encounter Worst patient ever. @person 1
@CAPS1 it was a beautiful morning, the sky was blue, the birds were singing and my sister was skydiving. She and her boyfriend zone were skydiving, so me, my friends and my parents watched. There were a few people in front of us so we had to wait an hour or so. Then another hour passed. Not even close to turning around. We were starting to get hungry so we went into town and ordered some breakfast, we got our drinks and was about to get our food when we got a call saying they were leaving soon. We had to cancel our meals and hurry back to this place. We got there and still no turn. I really don't know what happened, but we had to sit in the middle of the venue for almost four hours! Finally turning around, they got on the plane and took off. They circled the field for a while, then @CAPS1 looked like a little dot fell off the plane, and then another. They set sail and succeeded. @CAPS1 Turns out we sat there for eight hours before they jumped. Not including the one and a half hour drive there. I think I was very patient that day.
"Remaining! Right! Left high kick, swinging eyes! The boys' arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs are hitting the bag with great force!" @CAPS1! "The old man yelled "My child". @CAPS2 said "You are impatient. " The old man named @ORGANIZATION1 blindfolded the boy named @CAPS3 and let us throw sandbags at him. The first hit him in the head, but the boy kicked the second and opened it. @CAPS2 Grab the third and use it to stop the fourth. Boy learned to wait patiently for the enemy to strike first.
I was patient once when @PERSON1 @CAPS1 didn't work and everyone sat down and got frustrated. It took up the hole time, there was a point where chitt chatted with her, but mostly everyone was quiet for her while a group of students helped her. We're going to watch a movie about @NUM1 topics by @CAPS2 but when she tries to play the movie it doesn't play, you can hear it but not see it, at the end of the hour you can see it but You can't hear, "but it works for all other classes" @PERSON1 said the next day she gave us fruit snacks because she was so patient she let the movie go first and it was only grey and white she shook a card, Then it shows color, but the day I'm patient is @NUM2 times. I was patient with a teacher who was so proud of me and I was so proud of myself just let her fix her @CAPS1 but she didn't treat us the next day because our treat was just relaxing in our chairs and Talk to our friends. That's when my classmates and I were patient.
We had to wait in line for @CAPS1 coster when I was patient I was afraid some of the kids in the line were impatient and wanted to get on @CAPS2 fast I was patient when we got on I was scared to put on my face when I got off smile i'm glad i'm patient
It is important that you have patience. One should always be patient and not rush. All you have to do is take your time and wait. People need to understand that if you are impatient, certain things will happen to you. If you ever want something, then you have to be patient. One day at @ORGANIZATION1 my cousin shayna was impatient because she wanted to get on the dance box. However, she couldn't, because a little girl named @ORGANIZATION2 was on the dance box and shayna wasn't happy. When you know our attitude, you know our girls. Shayna got mad and started crying and rolling her eyes at @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS1 She's saying to me now, "She wants me in the car," @CAPS1 I'm saying, "@PERSON1 `@CAPS2, you have to be patient and wait for your turn because she's in the car first, that's going to get her out of the car Was rude and unfair." @CAPS1 @PERSON1 `@CAPS2 Apologies & they both take turns opening the dance box. But in the end, @PERSON1`@CAPS2 is happy, she learned her lesson.
When I was patient it was my mom who broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip, she moved slower than my grandpa was in worse condition than she was in @CAPS2, meaning it took @CAPS2 almost fifteen minutes to get to her bedroom. Usually I'm not a patient person at all, but when this happens, I have to be patient. I'm glad @DATE1 I'm patient because now I'm more patient than before. My mom is proud of what I did because I actually grew up a few days to help her when she needed @CAPS2. Patience is a good thing and you will see a difference in life. Now I can imagine I have patience. I mean I'm not happy my mom got hurt, but I'm happy with the consequences of my problem. After a major accident, I learned that everyone needs a little patience like me, and this is an example of how I thought about the patience I used to have here when I was a kid, without my mom.
I know a girl who is my friend and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very nice guy. She eats all the vegetables, does all the homework, and gets straight A's. @PERSON1 just one question. She is impatient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the cinema. We went on a Saturday night so it was busy. Long queue for tickets to @CAPS2. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned. I told her, "@CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, just ten minutes." @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms. "@CAPS2 your potato wine on it," I told her. About two minutes later, we were just five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 paced like the worst. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran up to me and said, "@PERSON2 we have to @CAPS2 to that counter before I explode!" I looked at her with my eyes, why don't you shut up, eyes. Then she nodded. I've been patient with @PERSON1 all night to make sure she doesn't go crazy. I made sure I stayed calm so I could make sure we didn't get kicked out by @CAPS2. You should always @CAPS1 be patient or things will go bad for @MONTH1.
Today I'm talking about patents. Patent means to handle something with ease or in a stupor. For example, I went to @CAPS1 machean and I want to make money, @CAPS2 I put my card and pen, then I want @NUM1 dolors @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only gave me receipts @CAPS4 cash @CAPS4 cards @CAPS2 I don’t Support @CAPS3 I just called the company and I got the money and card. NEW This is the main story I vented to the mall to buy shoes @CAPS3 vas 110 @CAPS3 is on sale for a hundred dollars, @CAPS2 I want to buy it cashier sad "one hundred and ten dollars please" @CAPS2 I told "he @CAPS3 is on sale , he's sad" left my store @CAPS2 I told him I came to buy shoes. @CAPS2 I returned @CAPS3 and vented. Play while I'm patient.
I was patient once when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 grandma @CAPS1, grandpa @PERSON1 and @CAPS4 brother @ORGANIZATION2. We were all just walking around and we saw a guy drawing cartoon characters. I said "grandma @CAPS1 can't we do this." @CAPS3 said "yes." @CAPS4 bro gotta get it first. I'm just waiting for him to finish. Then his picture was done and we looked at it and we all laughed. Next I sat in the seat where the sun was facing me. I got so hot that I not only wanted to sit in their seats, but I was patient. I didn't speak, just sat there and smiled. A photo that took about @NUM1 to draw feels like an hour and a half. Then I'm done. I looked at the photo and smiled I liked it. I was patient and I got what I wanted. Once I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1.
My patience is a privilege I don't usually have, @CAPS1, but I'm an exception. @CAPS3 bro, @PERSON1 ran from the downpour to the car describing the mood of the day @CAPS6. @CAPS14 opened the door and his first words were: "@CAPS2 needs to talk." @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded. "@CAPS4 around @NUM1?" I know @CAPS5 doesn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 was suspended from school by my side. If @CAPS3 bro didn't care about my hearing, I don't think I would have a fight. This is not the time. @PERSON1 revealed his story, leading to tension. "@CAPS6, some guys I found not very friends deliberately splashed water on @CAPS3 jerseys, @CAPS12 I'm going to explain the rationale, @CAPS3 @LOCATION1" "@CAPS8. This is what you should do, " @CAPS3 @CAPS15 was interrupt. "@CAPS9. @CAPS12 That guy, @PERSON2, was in trouble and went into a suspended state. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started following me and I felt threatened." I held my breath for @CAPS3, looking straight ahead. I'm breathing tension, not @CAPS10. "@CAPS3 @CAPS5 Fill out the next section," @CAPS12 You. Start hitting him? " "@CAPS13, yes. "@CAPS14 tragically admits. "@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to unleash your anger. There will be a lot of assholes out there. You can't start hitting them," @CAPS15 scolded. "I know, I know now. I'm sorry," @CAPS3 brother closed in the way he hates so much. I timidly asked @PERSON1, "@CAPS2 do you want a hot dog when you get home? "@CAPS16" I reject any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 is using. I know @CAPS14 is having a bad day. @CAPS1, I realize patience and understanding with the @CAPS3 bro is the best I can do things. I think I gained more patience that day.
Where I am patient is in my mom's doctor's appointment. It's a small health care place on @LOCATION1 road and it's so small that I had to wait in the lobby which was boring. I first started watching chanel @NUM1 news it got trusted. Then I went to the front desk and got a piece of blue pen and paper and started to draw, and when I finished it looked like a car, it was a far car; then I started looking for something to do. I started looking and finding, then a car magazine with cool car low-slung drivers, exotics, clothing, and more. I was patient when my mom was done and we left the house
The one time I had the patience was while queuing at the zoo. The animal I was waiting in line to see was a donkey. It was a hot @DATE1 day around 3pm and of course the donkey was the crowd favourite. Only a few people observed other animals. In the row of donkeys, there are hundreds of people. I'm in the middle of the line. I'm tired, but I see this donkey! I waited, waited, waited very patiently. There were only a few people in front of me at the end! I can see the donkey slightly. Minutes passed and I was petting the donkey: @CAPS1 Patience worth it or what? I wonder. I left the zoo, happy. I've never been so patient in my life! I gave myself a bat on my back.
One time I was in the doctor's office and there were a lot of people there, I just got there, my dad told me we should go because there were so many people, I said let's wait a moment, he did it later and my dad was pactiont, So it's @NUM1: The time they called was the name, we went in, I got my five and vaxsene shots, we left, we went home for dinner, we didn't sell tacos.
I'm really not a patient person, but last day. The number of years at the end of the school year. My sister @PERSON2 is having a baby. I wanted to go because that was my first nephew. So I went, so did my grandma, my mom, my other sister my #@CAPS1 and my sister @CAPS2. Boy friend. There are a lot of people out there, but not all of them can see a baby being born when I'm very young, but I don't want to see it. My sister was angry because she couldn't go in either, so she left, but I was bored to stay. But I stayed I went to the room to visit the baby birth took @NUM1 hours we went to the baby barn near @NUM2 at nine I went home to sleep at @NUM3 and got back there at @ NUM2 :00 we were at @NUM2 NUM5 saw this baby, his name is @CAPS3 , he's so cute and I'm so happy to be his @CAPS4. Now he is six months old and I love seeing him. When he grows up, he won't say I've been waiting for him to be born. Love @PERSON1.
One person I know got impatient when it was a lab project in my science class. This is actually a very funny way of being impatient for me. My classmates and I were divided into groups in different areas of the lab. We are doing a project on plant taxonomy to identify different traits. So everyone was trying to get their project done quickly and put their plants on their posters. After fighting for another set of tapes to occupy it. Our group finally got the tape. So our group just ended and two people from another group came to get the tape. One of them was trying to get some pieces, the other one he took too long I guess. So the waiters say: "@CAPS1 @CAPS2!" as a sign of impatience. So funny!
While I am patient. I was NUM1 years old when I got an as. I ordered online and waited. @NUM2 days passed and still nothing, a week passed and an ups truck parked at our house dropped the package and left. I'm so glad I didn't even notice it was for mom. I opened it and found the spoiled chef stuff inside. I'm really pissed! @NUM3 weeks have passed...I'm not upset because I didn't really know I was going to get it. But an ups truck came and didn't see it, guess what's in the package is mine! I didn't even realize it until @DATE1, I'm glad I got it. I forgot to order games with it. That's when I patiently saw you.
Patience means waiting, and one of my brothers is patient. We were there for six hours just to rescue my brother and we had to go to four different prisons to get my brother out. I'm scared, but I know if I'm patient, everything will be fine. So we've been waiting and we have until @NUM1 o'clock to bail him out. We've been with them since @NUM2 in @TIME1. My mother is very nervous. I told her many times to calm her down and everything would be fine. So he went in with my cousin and we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they didn't bail out around @NUM3 at the time. So let's go buy something to eat. We went again and they told us we had to sign a document. So we did. Then @NUM4 o'clock. They gave us something we had to cook. We went to @NUM1 different stores and they said we couldn't deliver. So we went to Chase to cash out my brother.
One day, a cool new game came out. That's a kid with @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @DATE1 volumes, but they say it's a hot volume. Kid asked his mom for @PERCENT1 @CAPS2 to say "what?" @CAPS1 said "so I can buy this cool new game." @CAPS2 said "@CAPS3 your dad and I have to pay the bill and buy Food. @CAPS1 said "@CAPS4 I got it" in a disappointed voice. @CAPS8 when the boys' hard-working dad walked in the door. Boys said: "@CAPS5, can I please @NUM4? ? ? , so I can buy the game. Dad said: "@CAPS6 I know how much you want this game, but I'm sorry I need to help your mother pay the bills. @CAPS6 said "@CAPS4 I get it. " @CAPS8 boy's grandmother called to say I need someone to break my laws for @NUM5". "I'll be there soon," the boy said with a smile. @CAPS1 mowing the lawn excitedly. When @CAPS1 gets @NUM5? ? ? @CAPS1 went straight to the game store and when @CAPS1 arrived the queue was @DATE1 blocks long. His grandmother said, "Okay, you gotta be patient." @CAPS10 because the boys were in the back. to be continued"
One day we went to @CAPS8 mall. salad. Rainer. Me and @PERSON1 want @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but sharae wants @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 pac sun so we are patient with her @CAPS9 @CAPS8 store. And then Reiner and I wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 but sharae wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS4 so we were patient with her @CAPS9. Then me and Reiner wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 but sharae wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1 until @CAPS5 we said  …..enough @CAPS6. We @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11! ! ! She said ok, ok, ok, but I can, no. Please, no, please. No! Well @CAPS12 we will @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 I just gotta ask @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 the bathroom.
Patience is a useful trait that will get you through a lifetime. Be patient, calmly wait or be content. patient; a person who is usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many kinds of patients. patient, patient, or patient. Are you outside? I'm going to talk about two. Probably not the two you think. I'm going to discuss a patient and be patient. No pun intended, but I think they all remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning, I had to travel. Not a field trip, not a vacation. A trip to the doctor's office. Why do I need to? To get my annual vaccine, here's why. It may not be cold in the morning. I was just nervous and when we got to the doctor's office (it seemed even far away) the office guy even called me and my dad to the front window. He said, "I have an appointment with my son." The lady in the front window said "@NUM1 appointment?" "@CAPS1 is that" my dad said. "Your son looks set up and vaccinated against tetns" @CAPS2 then told us to sit down. I waited patiently and read my book. After a while, I started to feel like there was no way out. I was bored and found myself playing with my fingers in my pocket. My dad likes to make funny comments, so he told me "You know what? You're a patient patient!" I laughed. My laughter was interrupted by the doctor who opened the door. Before I knew it, I got a needle stick in my arm. After that, I was fine. But what I've learned is that being a patient patient helps me stay calm while vaccinating. If I wasn't that patient, it could have hurt. I learned an important lesson that day.
This story is about Chicken Hand Fox and the time he has to be patient. Let me set the scene and grab the hunter chicken sent by Scourge and his mother @PERSON1, getting boiled. They should all be killed and thrown into the ditch. But the terrier just turned white. When he wakes up, he realizes his situation and knows he has to wait until dark to reach the @CAPS1 wall, and despite the insects already snowing on him, he's been waiting. Finally, when night fell, he rolled in the mud to prevent further blood loss and began his journey. That's when the cockerel has to be patient.
I have used patience many times. I'll be patient while @ORGANIZATION1 is on the bus, at home and at school. The first time I used patience was while fishing. At the time I was going to fish with my twitter @CAPS1 with a bag of salt and vinegar in the other hand. While I was waiting for the fish, I ran into my friend blistering a Norway goose who was probably out a week old too. When I met him I fed him some of my bait and I guess he likes the warm ones so I gave him all my bait. As soon as I grabbed the fries...I took a bite! I turned out to be a very small sunfish. But to this day, I still see Bubble once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). This year he kicked two ducks, I named them @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. There are very friendly and love to eat and drink. @CAPS2 is a little shy about the other ducks, @PERSON1 is content to just sit next to me or on the bench. Bubble loves cheese and cuddles with his duck buddies and me on the peaceful @DATE1 meadow. This story is true. @CAPS3.
My family and I were going to @LOCATION1 to @DATE1 for a year off and I was really excited to get there but we had to take two long flights until we finally got there. My family and I got up early and drove to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours until we got there. Then we checked that the luggage passed safely and went to look for our plane. Then we found out that our plane was delayed. We sat at the airport for hours until the plane came. Then we got off the plane to find the next one. That plane was delayed! So we had to wait another few hours until the plane came. Then we had to take another flight until we finally got to @LOCATION1. This trip required a lot of patience as I was desperate to get there.
Write down your thoughts on patience. @PERSON2 and his mom are on their way to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @PERSON2 waited all my life to go there. Bill's mom got a call from cousins @PERSON3, bob and @PERSON1 asking if they could go? @PERSON2's mom says yes. @PERSON2 is a patient boy, so he let it go. Still patient. Once @PERSON2's mom got his cousin, his mom got a call from five of his friends. They all asked the same question his cousin asked. His mother said yes. They each lived in different places far apart, so it took twenty minutes to get to each house. finally reached. @PERSON2 is pissed, but still patient. When his mom got another call, @PERSON2 said who it is now! ? ! It was his dad who called. I'm at @CAPS3 with my @PERSON2 siblings, where are you? @PERSON2's mom replied that I am now joining @CAPS4 for my patient story.
Hi, my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I'm doing meat tests at school right now because we talk so well! What are you going to get let's get one about us I'm very, very patient I'm going to see Twilight Saga. We got the tikes about a month early so I had to be very, very patient @CAPS3 so I waited and waited, @NUM1 was so slow @CAPS4 and I started thinking what if I stopped thinking it would get faster . Well, I asked if I could go to a friend's house and she was going to see the move, so went to @CAPS4 this month, and that night @CAPS6 I was going to see the move and my friend called me. She said she couldn't sleep so left I stood all night watching what's going on in the move I do know what's going to happen and it's fascinated me @ CAPS7 know what's going to happen I found feeling aslpeel and gase what I wake up to, @ NUM2 more zones, I read @CAPS3 to wache ecllpce , my zone goes to @CAPS4, I'm ready, so when I wake up, I'm fine, it's finally here, the way we're looking at it: We heard that, we sat down and looked at the website. It's a hare move, but be patient! That's when I had to @CAPS3 patients
@PERSON2 and her twin brother @PERSON1 excitedly line up for the concert. @PERSON1 hates going with his sister, she's weird @CAPS6. "@CAPS1," @CAPS2 complained. “@CAPS3, @PERSON1 @NUM1 asking for an earplug from her car.” @CAPS4 Did I let @CAPS8 come? " @CAPS2 asked impatiently. "@CAPS6 you can learn from @CAPS8 how to be patient, smart people," @PERSON2 said, looking at @CAPS8 to see how many people are in line now. @PERSON2 put her earbuds on Back in her car and bombed "@CAPS7 @CAPS8 The @CAPS9 Of @CAPS10 @CAPS11" ahead of Allstar Weekend. Great band they'll see at concert allstar weekend. @PERSON2 has been patient The twins, in fact @CAPS3 everyone calls her. @CAPS2 is the exact opposite of the impatient twins. @PERSON2 almost enjoyed the wait, which made her even more excited about things. It's finally time for @CAPS8 to watch a concert @PERSON2 Glad she was patient; she was ten times more excited than the others out there.
I was patient for a while, I waited a long time, my cousin, @PERSON1 was walking around town and we were looking for stupid bans, well, we went to the @DATE1 store first, but when we When we got there they were closed so we started walking again and then we saw my brother and my other cousin @CAPS1 they were on bikes and we were walking so @CAPS1 said there was a @PERSON2 store so go get there. Then @CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on our bikes and they walked. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 to see how casual they were and they wore @MONEY1 and some of them wore @MONEY2 so we went to the @PERSON2 tree and they were @MONEY3 but we didn't get them because @PERSON1 didn't like They had the same, so when we found them, we walked around and she didn't want them. So we went to my grandma's house and she asked me where I was all day and I said we were out looking for some stupid ban. My grandma said don't go where @PERSON1 wants to go. If your mom tells you to come over here, I'm trying to be patient and not try to yell at @LOCATION1.
Time my friend to be patient! One day is @DATE1@NUM1. That day was when the report card came out. I have good grades, I have @NUM2. But my friend @PERSON1 failed. Math, she has a @CAPS1 and she knows if her mom sees that, she'll be in trouble. @PERSON1 tried to cross it out and play well, but she knew her mom would find out. So she told her mom that "the report card isn't out yet". Her mother believed her. So she tried to reprint it. She called me, trying to get my opinion, "I told her my honest thoughts and I said @CAPS2". But "if you don't want to get in trouble, yes," she said. When her mother asked her "Is the transcript out". She said "yes," and her mom found out it wasn't a real report card. So her mom called the teacher and it was a fake grade. Then she's in trouble, she's patient with it, she's telling the truth. Her mom went to the office, got real grades, and my friend @PERSON1 was patient when she told the truth. That's when my friend @PERSON1 was patient with her grades. Even if she lied and tried to change her grades. She remains honest and patient. I know it's wrong for me, both tell her yes, but she begs me so she doesn't get into trouble.
Are you patient? I have and I have to say it is beneficial. I'm sitting in the waiting room at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 at @ORGANIZATION1. I plan to have my @CAPS1 washed, deep conditioned and ironed. The lady at the front desk called me. "Sorry, @PERSON1 won't be here today. @CAPS3 Anyone else want to be your @CAPS1? A puzzled look spread across my face." @CAPS3 @CAPS4 here? I asked. " Yes, but she has a client now." She can take you there at three tomorrow. ' she suggested. 'It's okay. " I said. I was feeling a little sad, but when I got outside, everything changed. It was raining. So I guess it's a good thing I didn't finish my @CAPS1. It's a good thing I have patience. Patience has its benefits.
My patience is at @CAPS1's biggest indoor water park, and I'm waiting to race the turbo twins. ''@CAPS2 time @NUM1'' our @CAPS3 said in a robotic voice, but only @NUM2 that means I have to be in the car for another two hours, almost three hours, I don't think it's fair, but I Knowing that if I want to get to @CAPS1, I have to be patient. "I have to go to the bathroom" I moaned. "Then can't you hug?" My mother asked if I was about to explode, and you asked if I could hold on? I wonder. "Ok, park the car here, but it will increase our @CAPS2 time." "I @CAPS4 not core!" I yelled to my mom as I ran out of the car door. When I got back in the car, I heard our robot @CAPS3 say "@CAPS2 time @NUM3." @CAPS6 people This means no more bathroom breaks, if I have to go again I will have to hold it. An hour or two went by and I screamed when I heard @CAPS3 say "to the destination on the left" "@CAPS8!" I rushed out the gate to the main entrance of @CAPS1, but then I saw a sign that said "Waterpark is closed!" Suddenly I felt Dad's hand on my shoulder and he said, "Sorry, sports maybe It's open tomorrow.'' @CAPS9 it's not open the next day it's still closed because they're doing a lot of rides and it's dangerous to enter the park so I'll have to be patient all day but I can we'll be leaving tomorrow The next day it closed again until 5, but we were expected to check out at @TIME1. So at @TIME1, the park was still closed and we checked out''I think we can stay for a day. I'll drop off for another night'' My dad said.''@CAPS8.''I'm going to the park! That's when I'm patient.
I think patience means when you're calm and you don't care what someone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is doing, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 patience @CAPS2 when your mom @CAPS2 is shopping for a long time and you want to go to a video game store and you stay there , a good patience, a bad patience @CAPS2 when you throw a little store, @CAPS6 good patience @CAPS2 when you're at the @CAPS3 amusement park and there's a @CAPS7 long line you don't complain it's patience a nice logo. Bad sign of patience In that case @CAPS2, you keep following. . @CAPS6 Good sign of patience @CAPS2 When you wait for your sister to come out of the bathroom, you wait for her to come out. When you slam on the door and you have to pay for @CAPS9, that's a bad sign of patience @CAPS2. Ask @CAPS6 Good sign of patience. @CAPS2 When you are locked out and go to your friend's house.
I was patient when I saw a giant perch jump out of my cabin. I waited for breakfast and then went fishing. My brother also wants to go fishing. So I was patient enough to wait for him to get a new bait and come out. So we went to the front and he caught a small bass so I unwrapped it and brought him over to show mom and dad what he caught but I barely realized a huge @NUM1 pound bass was out there wandering. So I vote @CAPS1 first as soon as I go out! A huge bass blew my mind. At first I thought I had caught a carp. But when I saw @NUM1 pound bass jumping in his mouth with my bait, I shuddered with excitement! When I showed that fish to my dad, he nearly fainted, as did me, my mom, and my brother Cody. Now the fish is in the tax office.
On the way to school one day I went to pick up my friend and he told me he had a new game called Call of Duty for World at War I said I can't wait to go home and play my new game and then I said it was cool and he said Started complaining but I have to wait another hour. I told him to be patient then he said you're right it's not going anywhere i can play anytime then he told me want to come over and play then we all went to his house and prayed the game and i told him remember is always patent until time arrive.
One of my patience is while waiting for the new game killzone @NUM1. I have to come up with @NUM2 bucks. @NUM3 lt for gaming, @NUM4 shelved it for me, I got it the moment I put it on the shelf in the store. The manager was poking them out so I grabbed one and bought it. I slowly started playing online games in my pss when I got home. I now have @NUM1,190. Combined, the first day of the game is really hard, or there's a store manager behind it. I don't recommend all games under @NUM6.
My family and I went to see Jimmy at @PERSON1 the other day as he worked at @LOCATION2 and was fixing his belt. After my brother and I got home from school, we went to @LOCATION2 because we saw a lot while traveling there, like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there. Then we see a sign saying "How did you get out of @LOCATION3" and another sign saying how did you get into @LOCATION1 and that's when the traffic jam happens. We went through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1.m It's not very smart but the worst thing is I sat there waiting for hours but we found a way to get rid of ourselves. Love watching @PERSON2's sea, waves, looking at the buildings there. This is my example of patience.
The time when I was patient was when I was seeing the doctor, and I stood there, calm and quiet. When the doctor called me, I wasn't nervous. So when the doctor gave me @NUM1, @CAPS1 didn't. Then my mom and I went home happily. Get some hwigese and watch @CAPS2. Then, we ate some pasta and went to school early. Then, when I was on land, I had a great day at @NUM2 grade school. Then, I go home, do my homework, clean up the house, and watch. @CAPS2, have dinner, then go to the led to start early
The time I had to be patient was on my birthday, about a week before my birthday, my dad and I ordered me a @CAPS1 girl doll. I am very excited because this is my first doll. Shipping is an issue, though. The week of my birthday. I've been waiting for the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 truck to arrive. I'm disappointed because it was shipped from @LOCATION1 and it didn't take that long to get there. Another week passed and still not here. I have to be extra patient. I can track it online and I'm still not happy. The reason it took so long to get here is because it has already arrived and they put it in the post office. Finally my mom asked when they were shipping and the lady said, "It's on the way." A few minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened her up. It's worth the wait.
Patience what can I say it doesn't like things as fast as I personally don't like when people do things slowly.
Patience is not a natural thing, it is something you have to learn. The three-hour drive is the perfect example of patience. Exactly the same as what I experienced. I @CAPS2 can't control myself as we pack for @CAPS1 city. I've packed my things, but Mom and Dad are standing. "@CAPS3, you please pack up and see I really want to go!", I exclaimed "you just have to wait," do?? But I @CAPS2 can't wait, so I caught it??, Tossed them in the trunk of our car and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they were packing. After they finished cooking, Dad took the last bag in their bedroom @CAPS4 complained that he noticed me and looked at me patiently. He thanked me, saying "@CAPS5 for being so patient, just for this, mom, a surprise for you. For you. He put down the sultan, walked briskly over to a white plastic, and suddenly pulled up to a rectangular benefit. @ CAPS6 @ Some of the CAPS7??????It washed?You?????????Of course not complaining.!
I was patient when I was @NUM1 and my mom said I had to go to the dentist @DATE2 it was @DATE1 so @DATE2 it was @DATE1 so @DATE2 my mom woke me up and I said yes, I Going to bed she said wake up you should go to the dentist alright mom she was like going to get you some clothes that i like ok so when we all got some clothes on i was just saying something Something was in her car and I stopped and said we're here and she pulled over and I opened the door and she pulled over. I opened the door and my mom signed us and then we sat down and there were a lot of people there so when we were seated @NUM3 minutes later they called us and I was about to yell but then they Came so the dentist lady took me to the room and made me look up because she could put things on it so the doctor came in and he was like we were going to clean our teeth. I cried because I thought it would hurt so I cried and said it would hurt so they put something on my teeth and they said the setup didn't hurt then they were done in @NUM4 mins so female dentist like you Picked @NUM5 codes and I'm glad I finally got some stickers, so when we left, we got in the car and I went to bed. That was my day of patience.
One day I had to be passionate and it all started with my work and I got paid for my work ok I'll get it that day @CAPS1 I want it and the second is different @CAPS2 I Must be pachionto.
One of my patience stories is that this time I wanted to play tboy @NUM1 while my uncle was talking nonsense. Well, like the other five kids, I asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient. So I sat there and waited for at least an hour or two, and it felt like this, I didn't say anything, and then I finally started playing. This is my story about patience.
I'm @PERSON1 and I was about to do an allgen and I sat waiting for @NUM1 hours. I played my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. An hour and then I watched my old TV so I started picking up my pace and my parents had to stop me from leaving @NUM2 times I almost got off the floor for the sixth time. Then it was time for me to go down to Angio's room. It was a fight because I wanted to walk and they refused. But they won. Then after Angel I had to lie flat for @NUM2 hours. then i have to go home
@NUM1 years ago we ran out of immigration limits. We need green cards to be @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So we went to an immigration center in the deproit. We went to the front desk and told the lady we were here. She told us to go and sit in the waiting area. There are about @NUM2 people there! I know we'll be here for a while. We went to the waiting area. I have no way to entertain myself. It says on the front, no gaming device, no music device. All phones must be turned off. That's a station wagon. About an hour and a half later, they called our names. I am very happy. After we got our fingerprints and everything was done, we walked to the car and my mom said she was very pleased with how I was doing in that office.
I remember one time I was very patient. I used to be able to wait for anything. One time I was very patient and I asked my mom for a game and she said, tomorrow, she got the game the day I asked her. At one point, I thought I was the most patient person in my family. I am patient and I can wait a month before going to Cedar Point. You have to be patient. Some of my friends are patient, but they can't wait long for me. Some of them even asked me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same to them as I say to everyone who asks my patience. You must be born with patience. It's not something you've learned over the years. I might want three weeks without getting paid from my dad. There's less and less there as some get older. This doesn't work for everyone. But soon I will learn that when I get older, my patients will be like everyone else. Who knows maybe someone might be more patient than me.
I've used patience many times, but I think the one I have the most patience with is hunting. You just have to sit there without talking and stay still. My uncle @PERSON1 and I were hunting in the back of my house, we went out at 6am and waited until 9pm. Darlings are finally starting to come in, and a Darling is close enough for me to shoot. I pulled up the bow and shot it, but it was so dark I could barely see it, and I missed it. My uncle didn't see it until the last second, and when I pulled the trigger on the release, I knew immediately it was going to miss. All you can hear is darling running away and arrows through all the leaves. So we went home really hungry that night.
I was patient when I ordered @CAPS1 in the mail. This is a cool @DATE1 @TIME1, I ordered a @CAPS1 online. When I arrived for shipping, I paid and went to the checkout screen. I saw how long it would take to get to my house. It says @NUM1 weeks. "@CAPS3?!" I exclaimed. "That's a long time." @CAPS4 decided. I have to get through @NUM1 weeks. I'm ready. @CAPS4 I waited. and wait. Waited a while longer. Until @DATE2 I saw @CAPS1. The address says "@CAPS6 @CAPS7"! I'm so happy @CAPS4! This has taught me to always be patient because chances are, you'll end up with what @CAPS3 yar wants.
Those warm tears streamed down my cheeks, and the hot wind blew my blond hair away. The only thing I can think of is why God had to take her away so quickly. Let's go back to a week ago. We just got word that my grandmother is going to heaven with angels soon. The next day, we were on a plane to @LOCATION1. This is my mom and dad; he was calm but we all have to be patient with him because of the @NUM1 kids he is the closest to her. When we finally took off, the entire @NUM2 hour flight was in turmoil. We can't get out of bed, @CAPS1 food, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and the throbbing sensation in our stomachs. This is @CAPS4! The flying experience I have ever had. I've been flying, only this time it's horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops until we reached @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes passed until our bags came in. I'm so glad I got out of that death trap! When we got home, I spent the last time with my grandmother. Here's one: a memory I'll never forget. The stubborn little stench on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I'll never forget is that my nickname came from her "chick."
"@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1!" @PERSON2 said, "I want to go first!" @CAPS2 The girl named @PERSON2 was on the cheerleading squad thinking she was the first to do everything. Oh yes, my name is @PERSON3. I always work with @PERSON2. I always wait patiently for my turn because I don't want to complain or be a bad place. "@CAPS3 set up! @NUM1, @NUM2 down up @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6" shouted both bases and backcourts. They pop @CAPS4 and scream "@CAPS5!" "@CAPS6 works." @CAPS7 said. "@CAPS8, it's my turn, @PERSON3, you can do better than her." I thought to myself "@CAPS9 we can do this." One of the basics that @PERSON1 said. I get @CAPS3. Hands on shoulders @CAPS3 to bounce you into the air. Does the other base @CAPS10 say "@NUM1, @NUM2 down! Okay, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6-@CAPS5!" "@CAPS6 works @CAPS12!" @CAPS13 cheers but fails. "I'm so excited," I just made a popular @CAPS5 without messing up my @CAPS5. " I thought with excitement. After @CAPS2, patience could be @CAPS6. I've been patient since that day. It really helps, so you know what you have to do or what to do less.
Are you patient? Sometimes I am, but sometimes @CAPS1 instead of @CAPS2 will tell you a story, when I am patient, @CAPS1 is usually impatient in this situation. I want to go to school with my mom so she can take the test @CAPS4 send me to the mall to meet my friends. While I was waiting, I was texting and surfing the Internet, @CAPS4 My stomach started growling, I was hungry. I want to text my mom to get her in a hurry so I can get something to eat while I text. I stop and think about what I'm going to do. I knew for a long time that @CAPS5 she was already studying for that exam. I didn't want her to get bad grades, so I just sat there. I text people. People call me so my heart doesn't care about food. After my mom finished her test, she walked out of the room. I asked her "Did @CAPS5 succeed?" She looked at me and smiled and said, "I'm confident but knowing @CAPS1 was hungry I called 'I'm going' and we got in the car and went to the subway. I got the forest now Great meal. With cooking, chips and drinks it was delicious. My mom dropped me off at the mall and I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. @CAPS4 We also went to @ORGANIZATION1, charlete , @CAPS7, @PERSON1 and other places. After I thought about it, I never wanted to do it again. I started, but I started to hurt. I sat there for @NUM1 hours with nothing to do, I would Wouldn't do that either. At least I get along with my mom. That's on the bright side.
The time when I was patient was at school. I'm waiting for my science teacher to call me ready to go. I sit in my seat. She was telling people to stand at the door and get ready to go to their next class.
Be patient @PERSON2.Hay, when food is given to her (say @PERSON1) you half be patient, @PERSON2 says so @CAPS1 says @PERSON1. Well you're going to have to snap ok; @CAPS2 hear your food (yes @PERSON1 shouting patience is all the way??? @PERSON2 I'm done let's say hide how to finish my food hurry up be patient, very OK) I'm done. wow that? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? @CAPS3 Patience is? ? ? . Are you ready, let's go, ? ? ? Success la la - what you put it with @PERSON1 Okay, @CAPS3 hurry up and be patient, @CAPS3 said @PERSON1, well, I'll be slower, @PERSON2, @CAPS4 I'll be patient. Where? ? ? ...@NUM1 minutes? ? ? ? Is this a good new good right? ? ? I'm @CAPS3 yes, I'm dad, you have @CAPS3??? Now and soo thanks. hay @PERSON2 look at that dymp talking about us, @PERSON2 replies to @NUM2 story building @CAPS4 see to say @PERSON2, be patient @PERSON1 says you don't need patience yeah i just thought i told...splat @CAPS3 If I'm not a patient.
Did you wait for the @NUM1 hour line? This is how I feel with @CAPS1. We were waiting at Cedar Point to ride a racing car that was too exciting. We just got there and the first thing we decided to do was ride the top thrills, but the queue was about three hours, so we went anyway. We just finished the first hour of waiting, but it felt like three hours. I know I have to be patient and relaxed, but it feels like forever. An hour later my stomach started growling and I checked my watch and it was @NUM2 I was starving and stratified when we got here at @NUM3 but I ended up staying for an hour and it was our turn to get off When I know it's worth a little patience. In conclusion, I learned that patience is a must for many things in your life.
If you don't, don't you ever think anyone in the world would be patient, @CAPS4. Luckily there was one time when I wasn't a very good girl and I did something I shouldn't have done but because I have such a caring parent they were as patient with me as they could be like all parents , they had to give me a lecksore what they did to me, but they didn't let me get rid of the hocks so easily. "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 please come to the office" I'm resigned, @CAPS6 I'm walking down a hallway, really? ? ? "What did I do?" I asked myself, thinking really hard. I've never been in the office "yes" I said "why did you hear it now" to the people who were there @CAPS3 said "no" I replayed it. "@CAPS4 I got some complaints from these girls" @CAPS3 told me "@CAPS4 oo ya" I said "what is @CAPS4" @CAPS3 said "the only reason I'm mean is because they mean they're awesome , they will tell my friends the only reason I hang out with them is because they have money, it's not true "Please @CAPS5 and alesay come to the office. " @CAPS6 They walked down the hallway and I could hear footsteps there. I really don't want to talk to them any more.
One thing I'm not very good at is meap. The reason I'm impatient with meap is because it's boring, you can't talk and it's boring. I hate meap, it's very difficult, you can't see tenn see or @CAPS1 doing meap. meap expects you to do a lot of work meap is one of the reasons I don't like michgan. meap asks questions and words you've never seen or seen before. In my opinion @CAPS2 we will do meap I hope they ask questions and words we know. Another thing I don't like is that they rate our writing, they rate their opinion. Meap is stupid to me @CAPS2 I have a choice and I will choose not to. Since meap is important, I do it for my grades. That's why I'm so impatient with meap.
When I was little I was always sitting and my mom always liked that @CAPS5 Now it feels like @CAPS1 is bigger and she thinks @CAPS1 inpasent @CAPS5 what are you @CAPS1 not ancey I'm not the type they say (we when to go yu gu) that's when I @CAPS4 learn how to talk @CAPS5 I guess that's how it's going and @TIME1 I'm because my mom and dad have a talk, I'm not going to be here, it's a gurorope talk.
My mom is patient because I use her phone a lot to text my girlfriend, text and call friends, and when I get a text or call, she tells me she needs to use it.
It's @NUM1 for @CAPS1 when I'm patient. My mom told me she was going to give me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 came I opened my present without @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it and she said she will get it when @DATE1 gets her taxes, so I have to be patient for @NUM2 months and days. I was pissed because I thought she had. So I had to go to school and wait until @DATE1 came. The day seems to be getting longer and longer. I'm getting more and more frequent, this is the longest @NUM2 months ever, I didn't even know it would feel so long, even though a year has passed. Ater @DATE2 passed, finally it's @DATE1, but I didn't get it like the end of the month, it made my little heart wait so heavily for something I wanted for so long. When I got it, all the games and apps were playable and the Conqueror was awesome. If anything happens to it, I will be destroyed. @ORGANIZATION1 It's expensive, but once you get it, you have to take care of it. That's why it should be placed in a special place away from small children. I don't even let them play it at all, if I feel hidden they might play under my supervision, that's the only time they can play. That thing would cost a lot of money to lose or break. Especially after that time, I had to wait. My little sister is getting something like that, but it's kind of educational. My little brother got a ds.. I'm glad they got something they can stop asking me for. My mom bought me some games for my birthday, I had one but my brother or sister lost it and I was so pissed they couldn't play it at all. This is undoubtedly a matter of waiting and patience. This is why? ? ? Can play it because I don't get lost or broke. If so, my mom won't get another one.
My first time sitting with @NUM1 little girls. A toddler named @PERSON1 and a baby named @CAPS1. After the parents left, everything was fine. That said, @CAPS4 @CAPS1 started crying like crazy. At first, I thought she was saying, "@CAPS3, @CAPS3!" @CAPS4 I realized she was saying, "@CAPS5, @CAPS5!". Her @CAPS5 was a blanket and when I handed it to her she immediately stopped! Now I realize how patient I am with her. I'm glad I know what she wants. Hope I can be patient next time.
It was one of my most memorable times when I had to @CAPS1 patients. I have to @CAPS1 patient is when I ordered my first priestly guitar I ordered from my guitar teacher @CAPS2 my guitar was chopped up. I'm very angry. We sent guitar @CAPS4 to @DATE2 for a new guitar and I bought another guitar so I opened it. That's the guitar I sent to @CAPS4 and I'm even more pissed off. So we sent the guitar @CAPS4 again, hoping we'd end up getting that one. That was @DATE1 and I got my guitar. I'm so happy, not angry this time, I'm glad my guitar is coming, @CAPS1 @DATE3 ice is my birthday.
Patience is a special skill for some people and a very difficult skill for some people. When I was a little girl, I never had any patience, even now. Neither did I, but my friend was always patient with me, yes she would tell me to hurry up or I would leave, but I would start laughing and get off right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and toss it to a pound, which is what she does all the time. Patience I'll never be as skinny as an adult @CAPS1, but I know I'll learn one day. Once my friend waited @NUM1 hours just to learn about history, I'll never know mine, but she got it again? ? ? ? ? ? On her @CAPS2 homework. So her patience with this is really cool, she told me that patience is the number one priority. He used to be my friend's patient one time.
It was a sunny day and there were long queues outside the airport. People are waiting for flights to @LOCATION1. Three hours passed, and everyone was a little impatient, but there was a little boy in the group who didn't seem to complain and was very patient. It's been five hours now, their flight has been delayed, the sun has gone down and the rioting continues, but the little boy is still waiting patiently. It's been twelve hours now, people are starting to leave, it's midnight, and the boy is still there waiting, not moving. There were only fifteen people left, and it was already dusk, but the boy waited patiently there. The plane had arrived and there were only three people there. They got on the plane. Others who left saw the plane preparing to take off and rushed up. But they were too late and the only people who reached @LOCATION1 were two girls and a patient boy. Finish.
Patience is hard to come by. Queue for something or wait for a letter in the mail. When I had to use patience, I thought of a great poem. I've heard of a book where you can type your poem and you can put it in the book. So I worked as hard as I could for a few days and ended up with only @NUM1 rows. I couldn't think of anything else, so I got into this poem. It said on their website that the letter would arrive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days, so I waited a long time. One day @NUM2 months, since I sent this poem, I got a letter of apology for taking so long for them to reply. Anyway, I've been reading and it says I use patience.
One day, I had to do something I didn't want to do, and if I didn't, I couldn't not go, and I couldn't go to the movies. When I was at my aunt's house, I had to clean her house, but I didn't want to, so she told me her house should be cleaned when she got home, and I was the only one there. When I went to @CAPS1 o'clock, everyone had this horrible high-altitude ride in the sky, you have to take your shoes off, not we have something to eat. The next day after everyone got up, we warmed up from the hotel and went home for breakfast, and then I wouldn't ride my uncle's quad bike down the hill, but he had started it, but I had floor mats on my knees and elbow pads and gloves. When I got to my grandma's house. I didn't know everyone was helping, but I didn't want to help, but my mom asked me to help, so no one went out to play football. It was a great game because I was looking out the window the whole game and I was impatient because I wasn't out of it. wow i'm watching a football game out the window and the other kids are running out the door and i haven't finished the wall
The time when I was patient was when everyone was taking @CAPS1.EAP today and when we all entered the classroom no one wanted to take @CAPS1.EAP when our teacher told us we had to write five pages and on @DATE1 we had to Complete the second part of the writing course and no one wants to. So when we got the paper bag where we had to fill in the answer, we had to fill in something on the front of the paper bag. Then we had to put our first and last name on it before we could take a break. After the break, we needed to read the book for free, our teacher had to read the instructions for all of us, we started, and when everyone was done, she told five or more people they could go to the bathroom break, when everyone When both went, she read the other part of the directions, and when everyone did that, the same people finished early, they got the real board, and they didn't want to read the book, so they all started saying she'd be right away Come back and say she has to go to the bathroom so once someone comes in to watch us and then all of them do paper basketballs and start shooting them into little hoops and then she comes in and tells us to get into our seats and we will start our final writing class , after that will be lunch, maybe even continue or lunch, and then everyone freaks out. So that's when I'm just patient.
The one time I had to be patient was when I was in my first NASCAR race. I have to be patient because there are a lot of people there and I don't want to be last in line. I had to wait until the person in front was seated. Secondly - we finally got our seats and I had to sit next to this horrible guy who was weird so the race started and you could tell because the racers were getting into the cars there. Jets fly over us and @ORGANIZATION1 is taking off. Then the racers start the race. Finally, my favorite racer's race starts to lead (@PERSON1). The car was going so fast you could feel the stands shaking. It's an interesting expression, but you have to keep listening closely and be patient.
I'm never patient, but I only do it once in a while. Sitting down and doing nothing drives me crazy. It's really quiet when I'm not doing anything. I have a terrible headache. For example, at school, I'm waiting like I'm hitting my pencil and my desk with my foot. Click ??? all things like that. I have to do something or I'll go crazy. Waiting in a doctor's office, or flying for a while on a plane can get very boring. When I wait a long time, I feel lazy and tired because I don't move at all. When I wait patiently, I get into trouble. Usually no more than @NUM1 minutes (half an hour) before I get really bad. I can't be patient for long or I'll have problems. One way I help myself is to exercise and do things constantly.
Patience is the ability to stay calm when one shows the ability to wait and make good decisions for me, patience is very important because it allows me to handle situations at will so that I @MONTH1 don't Will get stuck: @CAPS1 It's hard to be patient in times of stress. It's hard because people are giving you the greit. Without the patience of @CAPS1, people will make bad decisions, which will lead to bad things. Patience let me deal with bad ideas like @CAPS2' @CAPS3. By using patience I can deal with the problem and move on @CAPS2' @CAPS3 is a very bad idea
This is the night before @CAPS1 Eve and I can't wait. In the @CAPS5 family on the eve of @CAPS1 we went to @CAPS5 grandparents house. While we're there, we talk, eat and @CAPS5's favorite open gift. As @CAPS5 mom, dad and I drive to @CAPS5 grandparents house, I can't open the door fast enough. I rushed to the front door and rang the doorbell a hundred times. "@CAPS3 Hi @CAPS4" said the @CAPS5 grandpa. "@CAPS6, can we hurry up and eat so I can open @CAPS5's present?" "Yeah, sure." @CAPS7 We're done eating and I dash down the stairs as fast as I can. I can not wait anymore. As I wait patiently for all of @CAPS5's old relatives to open their presents, it's finally @CAPS5's turn. I tore off the wrapper to see what game this was. Since this was the first gift, I had to open it quickly, but from then on I waited patiently until it was @CAPS5's turn.
I saw someone @CAPS1 patient taking a break before I did, then I ordered my food and it came. They really didn't have food so I left and now they finally got food and that's what I call patients.
When I was seven, I played on a basketball team called @CAPS1. We were there for the championship with @CAPS2 and I didn't play. My coach told me to be on the bench for this game because I'm the hardest @CAPS3 player on my team to see. Without me playing, my team was behind @NUM1 and my coach didn't put me in the yard. Do I know if I stay calm and wait patiently for me? ? ? will let me play. So when it was @DATE1 with a minute left and we were @NUM2 behind, my coach told me to play and win the game for us. So I went in and with @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started shooting. But when we were @NUM5 points behind with @NUM1 seconds left, I was fouled. When you're at the free throw line, I have to make technical shots and it's just you, the ball and the rim. I had no problem with the first shot, but the second shot I didn't know what to do, so I thought about what I was doing in the game patient, so when I was ready to shoot, I had the patience for the shot to think out, When I shot, I made it, so as soon as the opponent got the ball into bounds, we stole the ball and won the game. If I didn't have patience in this game, we wouldn't have won and we wouldn't have taken home the trophy.
My mom was impatient, so I was surprised when my grandma had a whole bunch the day she died. I'm surprised she's heartbroken, but she's slowly and cautiously, as if every move she makes has to be flawless. It's a horrible day and all we want to do is cry. My mom knew my grandma would want her to be happy, so she watched her every move. As soon as I got there, she walked up to me and gave me a big hug, and she didn't mind whatever my brother and I did. It was a very surprising day because I have never seen her so sad yet so patient in my life.
When I was patient was my twelfth birthday. All my friends ruled out one and wanted to keep playing. So we did. We would love to walk the dog, then have dinner, and then open the shop. When we were all done we opened my presentts and I was so happy to see them. That's when I have patience. I'm very proud of myself for doing what my friends want to do. In the end, I got a lot of exciting stuff, I enjoyed the wait and it was a good idea to do what my friend wanted first. I'm pretty sure we all had a great time.
@PERSON1 swings with her friends all day and screams in pain when she swings so high that the chain comes loose and @PERSON1 falls. So they woke up in the house. When they got to the house, @PERSON1 was screaming and crying, they all got in the car and drove to the doctor. The nurse said she would have to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 was patient until she spoke to her friend. By the time the doctor was about to see her and she had forgotten why she was there, @PERSON1 found out she had a broken arm. Later that day, she thanked her mom and then called her friend to thank her for helping her be patient.
I think when I was injured in a football game and was on a stretcher, everyone was patient. They knew I had to go home empty-handed, waiting for me in the hallway and taking my stallion from room to room. An example of showing this patience is @CAPS1 @PERSON2 having to hurry to the bathroom but walk with me slowly so I'm not alone. Another example of being patient with me is @PERSON1. Lauren was patient with me when I asked her...?????????????
I am patient. One day, my mother and I went to see the eye doctor. This is my first time going there. We went to the lady and waited for the doctor to call us. We sat in the band for @NUM1 minutes and then we heard the doctor calling my name. We walked into the doctor's room and I sat down and he did all these things. Later he yelled at us that we have to see a doctor again. We sat down again and waited. Then we heard my name again, so we went. Worst of all, I saw medicine on the table and I was really scared. The lady made me look up and open my eyes. After that, she took medicine and experienced it in my eyes. I was terrified, when she passed the medicine in my eye, it kind of burned. I don't want her to do another one. I wanted to get up and run outside, but I couldn't, she made another eye and told me to close my eyes now until she came back. When she came back, she was me and we were done there. It's not too bad, I thought.
I forgot to take my helmet? ? ? Get it out of my mom's car because she's been working until @NUM1 and @NUM2? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Then my patience showed up.
Patience can mean many things. It can mean understanding or it can mean tolerance. Patience also means you won't complain. It's like you ask someone to give you something and they say they'll get it in a certain number of days. If they don't get it the day they say they will, and you're expecting it, then you shouldn't be offended. You can also be patient if you have to wait for something. If you're buying a new pair of shoes, the only way you can get them is if you have to order them. You shouldn't start complaining if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait and not get angry because you don't have them yet. Patience can mean all of these things. If you do these things, you can say you have patience. That's what patience means.
Be patient, that's how it is when I go fishing. If you cast somewhere, it sometimes takes nearly fifty casts to get a bite, then you have to wait for it to swallow it, and sometimes you have to be patient in picking the bait to use. That's because sometimes you have to be patient in picking which bait to use. That's because sometimes you have to count the color of the water, the amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to be patient where you are not because you have to wait for the fish to come back after the motor is running. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing.
Anna sits there and waits patiently, come on! She thought, met, and was very excited to carry out her now-improved beam procedure. Ana was one of the last gymnasts to go, only to make her situation more difficult, she took a deep breath and sat patiently, waiting for her chance to shine to the judges
When my classmates and I went to see the creed, it was @DATE1. There must be @NUM1 or @NUM2 people ahead of us. Then I saw people huddling in. After about @NUM3 to @NUM1 minutes, my legs started going numb, but I held on. I kept telling myself, "The pain is worth the wait!" Finally, we got to the security guards, who had to mentally test us. When we walked into court, I said, "That's a wife to look forward to."
When you have patience. Two weeks ago @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said her @CAPS1 is coming. @CAPS4 Grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot. This is $@NUM1. That's a lot of money. She @CAPS11 won't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I can not wait anymore. So she should be here on @DATE1. She didn't come. I'm sick so I call @CAPS4 @CAPS2 at her work. I said, "@CAPS2 why didn't @CAPS3 come." @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said, "@CAPS5 she's coming, you have to be patient." @CAPS6, I said. The next day is @DATE2. "@CAPS2 is she there?" I said. "@CAPS8, @CAPS5 Please be patient, she'll be here tomorrow." "@CAPS6, I get it." I gave up I thought she wasn't coming. So @CAPS4 mom calls @CAPS4 godmother. She said it was @CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I love @ORGANIZATION1. I'm so good I asked @CAPS4 @CAPS2. “@CAPS11 I have a @CAPS12. @ORGANIZATION2 cheeseburger. I said @CAPS13 to @CAPS4 uncle, @CAPS4 mom said she’s not coming. I told @CAPS4 mom I won’t give up she’s coming. So I say I am Hung up. So I was in a hurry. @CAPS4 mom said to @CAPS4 uncle @CAPS14 “Should I buy her something to eat? I thought she reminded @CAPS4 grandma. So I thought about who she was for a while. So I called @CAPS4 mom back and said oh I'm buying food for @CAPS14 Uncle Dog. I said, @PERSON1's? for the dog? She said she knew about dog food. So @CAPS4 mom saved me from @CAPS4 god mom house because @CAPS4 hurts @CAPS4's legs, back, arms and every part of my @CAPS11 movement @CAPS4 body. So @CAPS4 Grandma came to her house because we had the keys. So she said where is @CAPS16? @CAPS4 What uncle whispered, I said she was here! Ran into @CAPS4 uncle's room to hug her and I said how are you because when I went to @CAPS4 for grandma's birthday. She lives in South Caroline, so yes. This is @CAPS4 writing. That's when I'm patient. So I can wait for @CAPS1 from @CAPS4 mom.
When the first @CAPS1 came out two years ago, my stepfather paid $800 for one. He's glad all he did was brag about it to his family and friends. During this time my mom broke her phone and my stepfather didn't want her to use his. So she had no phone calls for at least three months. She's a little crazy, but worth the patience. My mom was able to buy it as the newer and improved product appeared in the store. She's happy, she has more apps, then the first @CAPS1 and a network communication. I think my mom did a good job of being patient because if it were anyone else, they wouldn't be able to wait that long.
When I'm about @NUM1, I want one thing. You know some girls will want a baby ball, not me, I'm not Rex this toy is the biggest and meanest dinosaur on a plant when I was a kid. So cool to me, it can walk, say it can run, he can bite. Every time I go to a story, I go to the toy part of the story, find that Rex, look it in the eyes and say "one day you'll be mine". You know how reliable, mom said the chismist was coming. When it doesn't come until @NUM2 months. But I won't be in @NUM2 months now. So I figured what should I do to get the rex before @NUM2 months? I understand! I'm going to be calmer, get out of trouble more, do better in school and hopefully it will work. so i asked my mom "mom if i started doing all this good stuff can i get that much of my chismast in a week @NUM5" she said "no you just get more stuff on chismis" i too Angry, I'm about to cry. But @NUM2 months isn't that long. I opened my present very quickly. But I thought I opened all my presents and I looked so happy! But I don't see anyone saying my Rex even though I have @NUM7 or more gifts. I don't have that Rex yet. So I walked sideways to my room. My mom came into my room with a big box. Will not! I jumped out of bed so fast that my mono didn't see me. I saw a lot of dolls in the box. Then she said go down to the stars and then he was happy to see me.
"@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!" my poms coach @PERSON1 said as we practiced the dance over and over. I love poms, but sometimes it can be tiring. We have exercises @DATE1 and @DATE3. We also have six girls, including me. My coach likes to let us do a dance by ourselves. In our first game, we practiced before leaving for our first performance. All of us were so excited, we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45pm and they didn't even start until @NUM6:00pm which was much later than expected. So all of my poms team, our coaches and all of our families had to wait patiently for more than @NUM11 in the stands until we finally got to the show. Finally @DATE2 and 3rd on the clock, which keeps us all stretched out on the track. We were all happy but still a little sad that we didn't perform earlier. We have a minute left, so we go to the other side. Coming into our formation, the clock quickly started dropping from 50 seconds down to @NUM12 seconds, and then soon we only had @NUM13 seconds until we moved on. I can't believe it's just @NUM13 seconds to our first performance. Excitement ran through my mind when the man announced "@CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom pon team" and then our name on the speakers. Crows roared as we entered the field. We all quickly remind ourselves to smile. Then the music played and we all danced to show our respect and gratitude to our coaches and parents. When it was done, we were automatically driven by friends and family. Waiting and patience is not so bad anymore. It's all worth the wait.
You must be patient when dealing with young children or the elderly. This kind of patience is key when dealing with anyone, but the very young and the very old need more. Older people often @MONTH1 get confused, have a hard time hearing you, or are just a little slower than you. You have to practice patience and respect them. Very young children sometimes get confused because they are just learning. Toddlers often become distracted and refuse to do what you tell them because you are impatient with them and start yelling. Patience is also important for people with mental or physical problems. If they are challenged, there is no way they can help it. People with intellectual disabilities often don't understand or don't want to behave like a toddler. Be patient with people with disabilities as some of @MONTH1's tasks are difficult for them to complete. Be patient with everyone because patience is respect. Fear is not respect. This is how I feel about the word patience.
The times when I'm at peace is when I'm babysitting the kids who are performing. I have a hard time calming them down. However, I've noticed that if I'm patient, so will they. So, I just sit down and tell them to calm down and they won't. So I told them again, this time they were a little quieter, and I noticed that if I ignored them or kept my cool, they settled down and stopped because they were trying to get my attention. If I'm patient, then I know they will too. It worked, they settled down, and it was important the next time I looked after them.
"@CAPS1 is trying harder to rule!" my teacher yelled "@CAPS2 tries but his @CAPS8 won't listen!" @CAPS3 has to be the most stubborn horse I've ever ridden @CAPS13 in my life! @CAPS6 does whatever @CAPS6 wants, as long as @CAPS6 wants, ignore me at all. "@CAPS4, @CAPS4 @CAPS8 brought him in." @CAPS6 said I slowly brought the horse to the center of the ring. "@PERSON1, I'm really trying, @CAPS8 won't listen." I said, "I know @CAPS6 can be a bit stubborn, but I let you ride him because I believe you can handle him." @CAPS3 The horse's name is @PERSON3, @CAPS6 is reddish brown with big glassy brown eyes . @CAPS6 looks like a good horse listening to the rider. Incorrect! @CAPS6 Not bad or sweet, don't listen at all! "@CAPS8 circled him around the outer circle a few times," @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS4 great." I replied. @CAPS8 @PERSON3 stopped when I was halfway through the ring. Then @CAPS6 turned right, walked to the window and started licking the water droplets on it. "@PERSON2! What is @CAPS6 doing!" @PERSON1 shouted, "I think @CAPS6 is licking the water from the window." I said "@CAPS10 get him out of there, @CAPS6 might get sick!" @CAPS4, just Like I said before, @CAPS3 horses have poor hearing! Now I'm in trouble because of him! "@CAPS8 Please be patient @PERSON2." I figured I really needed to calm down, so I relaxed a bit and kept riding without any issues. I think I @CAPS8 need patience and relaxation. Even so, I'll never ride that horse again @CAPS13.
On the way to visit my dad at @LOCATION1. I bring my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 when I have food in the car to keep me busy, I bring my @CAPS1 because if I ask are we there? Very @NUM1 min, I know @NUM2 hour drive needs some fun. I play games most of the time, so time flies, if I'm not gaming I'll have a snack, play with my baby cusihs @PERSON1, and sleep. After a while, I sat down to relax. The whole trip is @NUM2 hours, but through all of that it seems more like @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours.
Patience is basically waiting and tolerating it. Every year @MONTH1 @NUM1, my family does seasonal activities at the campground. There @CAPS1 to play and have fans and make many lifelong friends. Every weekend @CAPS1 goes there for a speedboat ride with @CAPS1, "Glass is from." @CAPS1 pats it into the lake and docks at the pier. Then @CAPS1 fished every part of the lake and sat there for six hours. This is where patience comes in @CAPS1 Gotta sit and watch the paddle floats float on smooth glass like a lake. @CAPS1 sitting there watching, talking and baking in the sun. I'm out of school and I @CAPS2 spend time with my parents and it's so peaceful. Then in school, I had to wait to throw the year away and wait patiently for the year to end. So @CAPS1 sat there until the sound of our float suddenly sinking into the water. There was some shouting and "@CAPS2 network" after that. funny. Part of that is because it's a big bass or a small bass. And all this requires patience.
My dog teddy bear is impatient because when he comes in from outside he gets a treat but he has to wait for the other dogs to come in
A @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient as I waited for my sister-in-law to tell my brother that we could go to the ward to see their brand new baby @CAPS1. My father and mother are waiting in the waiting room/hall with my sister, interrupt and me. There was about an hour and a half of waiting. I guess I can say I'm patient. In ten to fifteen minutes, I have to get up and walk around. I am very nervous and neurotic. But I drank three cans of Pepsi just before my patient time, which probably didn't help.
For me, patience is a personal thought that turns into action. I have endured it many times before. I used to go to the store around the corner of my block. I had to wait in a long line, actually in the middle of my block. I went in and got my stuff and went to the end of the line. An hour and a half has passed, and there are still five minutes before closing time. I walked to the window @NUM1 minutes before closing to pay for my stuff. I'm actually lining up and doing nothing. The owner let me get a total of @NUM2 items for free. I got half of what I wanted and the other half from home. So patience is really worth it and unlocks many different treasures. So start running patiently and leave your impatience behind.
Well, you need to be patient when you're fishing and when your food is about to be delivered or is about to be delivered to you, but also be patient with others.
Just as I was finishing my hamburger, I noticed the old, gross excuse of a bus parked outside the restaurant window. "@CAPS1 is that?" I asked in a raspy seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 replied: "That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1 plays." "@CAPS2 Wouldn't it be cool if we went to @CAPS4?" I questioned. I saw my mother whisper a few words to my brother. That's when they told me we were going to a show. Excited, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across the road to @ORGANIZATION1's palace. This is huge! I just want to get into this amazing building but my @CAPS3 keeps telling me we have to wait. About fifteen minutes later, the two Pepsis I'd had before went through my system "@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom," I said over and over. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front door. The inside of the building is even more exciting than the outside! However, a red rope blocked our way. "@CAPS4 My son goes to the toilet?" my @CAPS3 asked a woman sitting behind the front desk. She coldly "rolled" and we were forced back into the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert was about to start, so we headed back to the building. This time the red rope was gone, replaced by a team of nearly fifty people, all waiting to pass the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes but we got to the front and we passed the metal detector and were seated. That was a real test of my patience, but when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom, it was all worth it.
I am patient when I go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. First, when I got a can from my friend @PERSON1, he let me go. So I say yes. I have to be @DATE1's skin. Then he drove a long way, but I'm happy. I felt good when we got to the entrance.
There used to be a place called unpacienteland. But in a grumpy alley lives a little girl named @ORGANIZATION1. She is the most patient girl ever. One day @ORGANIZATION1 went to "mtso fast salon" for a haircut! When @ORGANIZATION1 got there everyone was screaming at @CAPS1 and the barber and @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said hey if you want your hair to look good please sit down and be quiet and everyone does . @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a nice haircut like everyone else, then @ORGANIZATION1 because the mayor of the unpaciente land renamed it @CAPS2 land, and since that day, everyone is at peace.
When I was patient and when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my stepmother and brother. He was checking his knee; @CAPS1 was in that waiting room for two or three hours! Jody (my stepmother) was really pissed off and I told her the doctor would be out of the hospital soon. I'm patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 are playing on his phone. This puts @CAPS2 at ease because usually I'm not very patient and usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that I'm really impatient. For some reason, I'm fairly patient when I'm really excited. I'm excited to see if he can get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was happy, two hours was worth it! This is when I have patience.
Once I was patient. This is the eve of dec @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1. I'm excited @CAPS1. I slept until @NUM2 the morning before @CAPS1 I want to sleep? ? Come. I'm patient so I play video games without thinking about @CAPS1. When I go to the store, I see all the @CAPS1 stuff. I don't think I can wait any longer. After dinner that night, I found that I wanted to stay rather than go to bed early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A small part of me wants to sleep, but I also want to stay up late. I made some more food and went to bed. When the morning came, I was overjoyed and ran into the living room. There is indeed a gift. My parents are still sleeping. I decided to watch some @NUM3 coming, I want to open them? ? ? I know it's not right so I go to bed? ? ? When I woke up at noon, I ran to the living room. My mom, dad and brother were there and I opened presents like a lion eats a gazelle, and I'm glad I waited.
When I'm patient, I have no fear and no arguments, but I have a good deal. I have a @CAPS1 @CAPS4 great my sister @PERSON1 said "@CAPS2 I got some" I said "@CAPS3 you @CAPS2" @CAPS4 is a miracle so I'm driving her car at the gas station. I went to @ORGANIZATION1. I said, "@NUM1 @CAPS5 please" @CAPS4 is my cousin and she said, "@NUM2 days ago" I was like "wow" @PERSON1 called me because @CAPS4 was my dad's weekend and she Say, "Go there now and I'm like wow.
I had to patiently drive to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 took a few hours, so here's @CAPS2's story. We were about to leave the house when I realized I had forgotten something. I rushed in to get the @CAPS2 dog pennies [is she real or not] @CAPS2 dog bit the door and I put her on the truck. We stopped for a break at @CAPS2 Grandma and Grandpa's house. We walked a lot until we reached the highway. "@CAPS1 will be a long journey" I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed by us. For a second, we lost our grandparents' car. I looked back at about a dozen cars and I found them. We arrived at @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip, so I decided to take a nap. Bold @CAPS2 napping @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 moms] taking pictures of me. I think @CAPS1 is bad. We now have one more state to go through, then at @LOCATION1. That status is @LOCATION2. When we got to @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a hotel-like room. In the morning we stopped for breakfast. Then hit the road again. I have to be patient as we are still two hours away. Five hours the longest, but I'm patient, so @CAPS1 is fine. We arrived at @LOCATION1 and don't know where we are going. So @CAPS2 Dad turned around and we found our way to our cabin. This is a story about having to wait patiently.
There have been many times I've been patient @CAPS1 this time my little sister has been bugging me and I haven't screamed at her or hit her. She asked me to turn on the music, I said "no" and she got used to it. So I got up and picked her up and told her in an amiable voice to stop before she got hit. She stopped. I told her to sit down and watch TV quietly. Finally, I was patient with my little sister during that time, not screaming at her or hitting her when she expelled me. I hadn't been a mean person yet. Last but not least, I am a patient person.
For me, patience is when I help others solve their problems, so in this story, I will describe to you what patience is. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help others solve their own problems. I'm patient because I've been sitting down and helping people with their problems. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl had a really tough problem at home. When she came to school, she cried. I went to ask her what happened. She said she didn't want to be at home because his mother wouldn't let her go anywhere and she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat with her all day and made her feel like she could talk once in her lifetime. When we sat down to chat, she seemed to feel better, she felt like she had a real friend. All in all, I really felt like I had the patience and from that day on, I sat down and let people tell me their problems.
One time I put up with it all day! It's the eve of @CAPS1, about @NUM1, which means I just woke up, I've had my breakfast, I've showered and brushed my teeth. So far, if I could open a gift, I might have asked my mom @NUM2 times, but on this day I haven't @CAPS6 asked him once. I was playing my playstation when my mom called @CAPS2! ! ! ! I opened the door and, as usual, my cat was at my door. I closed the door, jumped over my cat up the stairs, and yelled for food. He sewed down the stairs and ran straight. As I started walking down the stairs, I heard @CAPS3! ! So I knew my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming, so I started running down the stairs as fast as I could. They meet @CAPS7 at the counter and ask @CAPS7. "@CAPS4 How many times have you asked to open presents?" "@CAPS5" I said. They looked like they had seen ghosts. After lunch, I ran to a friend's house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finished the game and biked back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2 and about @NUM5 minutes later I finished watching @CAPS6.V. Take a shower and go to bed. My mom woke up @CAPS7 at @TIME1 and we went downstairs to heat up and I screamed @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as soon as I saw all the presents! ! ! ! That's when I've been patient all day.
"@CAPS1 @CAPS2" my little sister @PERSON1 said, "@CAPS3 you help me practice football, we do it in the gym, I @CAPS6 don't know how to do it." "Of course" I said "let's go to the backyard" @CAPS4 I caught a ball while I was out. I put @CAPS4 on the ground in front of me and say "@CAPS5 all you do is walk forward with your left foot and kick with your right." I'll try @CAPS8 to say" arrogant. @CAPS8 Run to the ball and he missed but that was @CAPS7. @CAPS8 try again. @CAPS8 sits on the ground @CAPS4. I walked up to her. "@CAPS6 not just a second try, not everyone Get good at football and try again. "@CAPS7, try again." @CAPS8 runs to the ball and kicks. The ball goes into the goal. "@CAPS9 You taught me @CAPS2." "I'm glad to be patient with myself, you're going to be a great footballer." "@CAPS7 but I want to practice more." "@CAPS7."
Patience is when you are understanding and forgiving. A lot of parts of life come with patience because some things are worth waiting for @CAPS1 is always the time and place of everything and getting there comes with great patience.
On the plane to @ORGANIZATION1, we were patient enough. We have been patiently checking in. Now is the time to really test your patience. We took a seat at a table in the hotel restaurant. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, and dispersed. We took our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 minutes, @NUM2 minutes. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 minutes. An hour later, we called her over and asked for bread. Look, she brought bread! We asked her where our food was. She promises to take it out right away. We've been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We called the manager to complain and a minute later he brought the food out. After @NUM6 hours of patience we finally got our food.
When I have the patience it's me and my mom and dad and my brother going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We have to pack up and leave within an hour? Want to leave it to a room and tint and ??? tidy up? ? ? This? ? ? So what? Any on the long road? ?? I decided to relax and wait for the heat ? Heading my way so I dream of lines without lines so I can get on every line? Hungry so I sense someone when I'm about to ride? ? Savings are born when I get light, is that my brother? ? Shake me up? ? ...I know she's an old big sign saying welcome to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. After sleeping for so long, it has disappeared after all. So I think I'm heartbroken without the lines. The line as long as @LOCATION1 itself tells me it's going to be a long wait. As I became more patient, I started to draw someone grabbing me, and that was my mom. She said why are you in a bad mood I said because these lines are san please be patient this is what I did. It was finally our turn, so I got in the car and she was right, the patient queue was worth the wait, it was more fun to get in. So when I thought there were no lines, my heart was broken. This line as long as @LOCATION1 itself tells me it's going to be a long wait. As my patience grew, I started drawing and someone caught me, it was my mom. She said why did you say it because those lines are the most important, please be patient, that's what I did. finally it was our turn so i got in the car and she was right the patient queue was worth the wait and it was more fun to get in the car
It was @DATE1 when my family and I went to Cedar Point. It's really exciting and fun. The trip is about three or six hours long. I went to bed but when I woke up we were at Burger King. I ordered a kids meal for us and it was good. So when we got back in the car, I stayed up the rest of the way. Then I started seeing water parks and hotels, which were really nice. Then I saw this very high roller coaster and I was really excited and I ran into the line and the beds were all long. I waited @NUM1 minutes. I was so happy and excited when it was my Tom and when I got my stamp I ran to @CAPS1-@CAPS2 in the roller coaster at the door . So I queued for an hour and was really tired, but I kept going and when I got to the stairs I finally got in the car. Once I was scared because it was dark. Then we took off, and it took off _ _ I got on the ride that rocked side to side. He is when I am patient.
Waiting in line for @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I complained, "@CAPS2! When are we going to the park?". "@CAPS3 patient," the @CAPS9 mother hissed back. "Patience is boring!" I complained again "Yeah," @CAPS9 sister shouted. "@CAPS4 is so boring! It doesn't, @CAPS9 feels hurt and-" @CAPS5! '', @CAPS9 @CAPS2 shouted. "We're almost there!" @CAPS6 @CAPS8 It seems like a few hours and we @CAPS7 at the ticket office. "@CAPS7!" I mean. We went into the park. "@CAPS8 first?" I asked @CAPS9 girl pointing to Yicheng. "That!" @CAPS9 sister yelled before going for a ride at night. We rode with @CAPS9 sister. "@CAPS10, let's ride @CAPS12. Looks like fun." @CAPS9 Dad said as we walked to the line. "@CAPS11! More waiting!" I yelled "@CAPS12 will go on forever!" I complained.
I showed patience before. I'm going to tell you and that time. two years ago. I work from @CAPS1's home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do a lot of work. I got it all? ? ? Grass mowed around his neck, wood and a lot of meters? ? ? . After about seven hours of trying, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could get my money. he? ? ? He told me when I asked why. He gave my uncle a lot of money to go on vacation. My heart sank. I asked when he would get it. He shook his head as if he didn't know. Anger filled him and he rushed towards me. a week? ? ? I go back? ? ? house ask? ? ? Because I really want to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind says patience, but my body says no patience. I listened to my heart. Really waiting, but I know patience is the right thing to do. Patience brings opportunity. three weeks later. He hasn't given me the money yet. I heard someone knock on my door. I moved there. Here is my @CAPS1. He came here with a big smile. Suddenly, he opened my hand and gave me twenty dollars! "@CAPS1 is more than double," I said, my heart beating. "I know, but you deserve it." I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. I showed patience that day. Having patience is really good for me because I make a lot of money. Next time you don't want to show patience, think about my story because it might pay off.
When I was about nine years old. I took my homework home. I showed my homework to one of my older brothers. He looked at it and he started helping me do it. Then he made a few answers. Show me what I have to do because I really don't know how to do my homework. So he had to do his homework, so he told me to do mine. So I started my homework and I got all the questions right. But this is a very tricky question. T wanted to ask my brother. But instead, I didn't do it because he was doing his job. So I did it myself.
Middleton Secondary School, I was one of their students. My name is @CAPS1 and I'm new here but you @MONTH1 think I'm a boy. Well, if you do better, listen to @CAPS16, I won't say it twice; patience is an effort. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1's class and I was seated next to a girl with wavy blonde hair, sparkling blue eyes and a genuine smile. "@CAPS2." @CAPS3 said. "My name is @CAPS4." @CAPS3 said in a snappy voice. "@CAPS2." I replied. "I'm @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1." "@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1." @CAPS4 replied. "@CAPS11 let me show you around." "@CAPS12!" I replied. @CAPS4 and I became good friends, but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends, they all made fun of me for having a boy's name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 is @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just won't let @CAPS13 go. In the end I said to her, "@CAPS17 @CAPS4 of @CAPS13! Just let me handle it." "@CAPS15?" @CAPS3 asked to cross her arms and tap like @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 couldn't do the same her feet. "@CAPS16, you're just impatient!" I said, a little pissed that @CAPS3 couldn't understand. "@CAPS17 that's it @CAPS1!" @CAPS3 said rushing out of the room. "@CAPS4 wait!" I cried, but I was willing to chase her. "@CAPS20 please don't get @CAPS13. You can't keep mad at them for making fun of me. I know you're trying to protect me, but it's @CAPS17. Have you been patient before?" if @CAPS3 from me Run away, I asked ready to run. "@CAPS21." @CAPS3 said, looking down at the frayed floor. Then I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again.
I went to the tennis players with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my brother, @PERSON1 and my grandpa, and my grandma who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 I drove different cars with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1's Kim Minnie van. The windows in our car were down and @CAPS1 and I smelled burning rubber. @CAPS6 is in front of @LOCATION1 because @CAPS6 slowed down and @LOCATION1 pulled over next to us. @CAPS6 pulled over, @CAPS2 got out and grabbed a book and said "@CAPS6 is leaking denaturant." @CAPS6 drove into town, @LOCATION1 followed us. @CAPS6 parked at an autin store @CAPS6 was the only one there and mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. @CAPS6 After cleaning the car, he pulled the car up the thue elevator, when I first saw the gradge. It smelled like gas and everything was oily and dirty (including mucus). "@CAPS7 will ruin our trip" I said to @CAPS2, "@CAPS6 not sure" he replied. It's hard to sit back and wait patiently. I walked back and forth between the Minivan and the grass for about two hours. Some other mocanics came, but no one knew what was wrong with our car. @CAPS2 Went on their computer there and looked for car parts but it didn't help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1, she took her car to the @CAPS10 garage for adjustments. @CAPS6 Not sure. After sitting in the store for about three hours, I was hungry and so were the others, so @CAPS6 went to a restaurant across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 was in the store a bit longer than the rest of us. During lunch @CAPS2 said "will have to call AAA to pick up our car. @CAPS6 will have to go home! I'm so frustrated after @CAPS7 waiting for @CAPS6 to have to go home. Tried and fell on the way out of the restaurant On my wrist. I sprained my wrist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street, behind the stereo shop is a wall shop, so @CAPS6 stopped there, bandaged my wrist, and picked a book Buy. I have The Vampire Diaries, @PERSON1 has a Star Wars book. @CAPS6 read them on the rocking car in @CAPS12's car.
When I went deer hunting with my father, I was very patient. When my dad and I went deer hunting, I had to wait. The hardest part is keeping quiet. I also had to stay still. To be a patint is to wait for something. I have to be patint because I've been waiting for a deer all day. Even now I don't get a deer, I'm quiet, still and patint.
Finally, the months of waiting are coming to an end! My mom wants to give me a cell phone! Although it's her old, it's new to me and I can chat with my friends anytime. I @MONTH1 didn't get the service I wanted, but at least I don't have to worry about being late for my appointments anymore. Like I said, the wait is almost over. Ok, so I'm not the most patient person in the world, but it's worth it! You see, I'm going to track and field, cross country and choir. Since I took the bus home and all these activities ended long after the bus left, I needed someone to pick me up. In order to do this, I need a cell phone. My mom said first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. In the end, I need to show that I'm focused, that I can maintain my grades, and that I'm responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen on @DATE1, she moved everything, I've proven I'm focused, I've kept grades, and now I just have to prove I'm responsible. To do this, I've been watching my neighbor's pets, mow their lawns when they're away, help them with their grandchildren, and I'm cleaning and keeping the house clean. So far, I have been able to convince my father and grandmother that I am responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mom is still not sure. I figured if I could half the house and keep it clean till @CAPS1 she would finally give me her old phone. After @CAPS1, though, I might have to pick up the slack too. When I get a phone, I'm going to have to continue what I'm doing now. So, I won't get out of trouble or anything, but I'll have more freedom! I still have a long way to go, but in the end it was all worth it. I finally have my own phone!
Patience is worth it. Because if you don't have patience, you won't get that far in life. If you're impatient, pepol wunt lak you simply don't. And you don't have patience, you won't be fis stuf.
@CAPS2's story is about the time @CAPS2 mom ran out of gas. @CAPS2 Mom drives home along @LOCATION1 @NUM1. Soon we started running out of gas. Unfortunately, it's raining. Then we ran out of gas. First, she has to put someone on a jumper and ask if they have a cell phone. Finally someone did it. She asked if they could cheer. Everyone said "@CAPS1!" @CAPS2 mom then decided to call @CAPS2 dad and get him pumped. An hour later, he showed up with a few gallons of gasoline. That's enough to get @LOCATION1 home. If @CAPS2 mom had the patience of @CAPS1 she would go crazy.
One day when I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we'd do it later. So I waited for hours, hours, and then he said our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when I saw the dunes, I knew climbing it was a bad idea for me, but I did it. After I got to the top. I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like a dead animal. Five minutes later I was fine and climbed to the top of the dune as I got up and ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop, I stopped. But I have seeds in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell and we all laughed when my friend got out of the car and @CAPS2 went back to our campsite.
My name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing about the time I have patience. It's a good @DATE1 @TIME1 on @DATE2 it's the eighteenth, we're driving to @LOCATION1 for vacation, we're going to @CAPS2 land. Everyone was in the house and packed everything into the hammer we rented for the trip so everyone could fit in the car. We packed everything into the car. I made a great breakfast for us. A hearty meal of sausage pancakes, bacon and scalded eggs. This is delicious. After that, we got in the car, we were on the highway, and I slept after an hour of driving. It is now ten o'clock in the evening and I am awake again. My sister yelled at my brother and then my sister and I eagerly told everyone to be quiet, and we did, but we were very nervous about each other. I had to put up with it for two more days, but we got there and I was happy to be there, so overall it was fun until we had to go back.
I was at the farm waiting for my dad to come home so I could ride my wheelbarrow. Then later that night, he called me and said he would be later than I expected. He went home three hours later. That means I have to ride my quad tomorrow because no one is home except my grandma and my dad doesn't want me to ride my quad and my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 are not theirs. I was hospitalized at that time. The next day, my dad called me to say he was working late again, so I couldn't ride any more. I got even more impatient, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if he could ride my quad and he told me if my dad said yes @CAPS1 I could. So I called my dad and he said if my uncle @PERSON1 said he was okay, it was @CAPS1. Then I can ride my quad and I'm not impatient anymore.
Hunt with patience. Hunting You can't go and catch a deer. you have to go. Because deer won't come to you. Deer don't like people, so deer come to smell you. If you are impatient, you will get nothing.
I had to sell my cow last year because she was sick. I have eight months old to get a new calf but I didn't get one until I asked my uncle who handles @CAPS1's calf breed witch or mail charges @MONEY2 but he gave me one about her The deal for @MONEY1. It took me eight months to fine him. But during those eight months, I got pretty tenacious, and I didn't sleep well at heights, so when I brought her home, I was glad I found her. I still worry about her at night because cougars are on the clumsy side.
Do you like to wait in line in the store? Well, neither did I? ? ? Well, I'm going to tell you about my experience with hospitalization and patience. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get to the bus stop @NUM1 minutes early so I can talk to my mom? ? ? Try I get up early. I got to the bus stop early. ? ? ? @NUM2 minutes later, I decided to go home. When I got home, I was already late. I rushed to the door, but it was too late, the bus had already left. I should have more patience. I'm going to Hamburg that day? ? ? Was asking for a hamburger with bacon cheese and a toaster. When I got them, their location was about @NUM3 peace, so I decided to wait in line like I did later. The people I was there paid from the cash register. I was finally them, I ordered my burger when I was done and it was worth the wait. In conclusion, you have to be patient with everything you do. Sports, school or family, even in public, I hope my story makes you understand how important patience is.
My patient time is @DATE1 at @ORGANIZATION1. I was about @NUM1 at @TIME1 when we asked for our seats in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes until the first @PERSON1 came on stage and their @PERSON1 was named @LOCATION2. Their appearance is weird so they look like a rock @PERSON1. But they're just normal @PERSON1 playing normal music. They play songs I've never heard before, but now I hear them more often. The second bad is another one I've never heard of. I don't remember their names, but they're not my kind of music. The next @PERSON1 is my new one; their name is @PERSON1 and they are awesome. The lead singer has a long beard and black hair and is very funny. They seem to go the fastest because I like them so much. Next up is another singer whose name I've heard is @PERSON2 and he's great too. He even made up a song about @LOCATION1 in his head and never stopped for four minutes. Then he's done, it's about @NUM3 @CAPS1 night now. I am getting tired. But right there, I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready and I was really excited, they opened with a song called @CAPS3. Each has flash and regular light. The man with the drum even moved. it did @NUM4? and @NUM5. It flew @NUM2 feet in the air, did flips and everything you can @CAPS4. Their frontman @PERSON3 and their drummer even played a drum, which is cool. Until around @NUM7, which was awesome. I may never be white like that again!
Patience is sometimes hard and sometimes easy. For example @CAPS1. I always get up early in the morning @CAPS1 and lie on the couch. Same as my brother. We wake up at @NUM1 and open the @CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes lit up as we let go of all the gifts that could be opened. First, we lay on the couch and stared at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we found another chair and stared at them from a different angle. We do that until we both end up on the couch again. Once or twice we were called to go back to sleep. But it didn't work because we never do it. Then around @NUM2 am, we started getting stupid. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to get our minds out of it, but it never works. Then we go back to the sofa. Around @NUM3 we went into the kitchen and made coffee for our mom and dad because they said they always needed coffee before we opened the presents. Then we went to wake them up. When they finally got out of bed, we urged them for coffee so we could see what we got. Finally in @NUM4 minutes they are done, let's open our present. It took so long, but it finally paid off.
When I'm patient, I'm in the car and my mom goes to the store and I go with her. I was patient because I didn't tell her when we were going home, otherwise @CAPS1 was boring. I try to go with the flow. I was there for @NUM1 hours and I didn't care because I was the one who wanted to come and I came. If I would complain, then she would say "why did you come". @CAPS1 Finally my mom said since you have patience then you can get a chocolate bar @CAPS1 and if you have patience there may be a reward at the end.
When I was very patient, the time I had to pull my teeth took two hours, they took about @NUM1 minute breaks every half hour, and I got a lot of gunshots in my mouth. They ripped open my gums and bit two teeth. And then my two lower teeth. I was a patent at the time. They even said I was one of the best kids out there because of everything I went through in my mouth and the long pank. This is when I pulled @NUM2 teeth and was very patient.
"When can I drive?" I won. "You'll have to be patient then or you won't be yelling my @CAPS1 in the loud, warm voice of @CAPS2. Started for the @NUM1 times of the year. I love that sound. It's my second favorite sound .The shock rattled my lag while @PERSON1 was driving. I could wait until it was my turn. After I rode and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS1 said something I thought he would never say, "@ CAPS3, it's your turn. " I looked at him, then the truck. Wow, next to that truck, he looked small. I ran as fast as I could into the pit. I climbed on the tire rim, then on top of the tire, and got into driving Room.” @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, quack @CAPS7. Oh yeah! It feels right. I can't walk fast, but I almost tipped it over. So that's a good thing. So all in a nat shell, paconts go a long way.
I don't have much patience, but I will tell you a story about what I once did. It was a sunny day, @DATE1 after school, and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to the slide park. We are all in my house, but @CAPS1 is not. My mom said "@CAPS2 he's gone in two minutes, we have to leave him". So I'm so pissed I'm writing a note on the door that says "@CAPS1 we had to go with you because you're late! Sorry for being on time next time. -@CAPS4". But when I signed the note, he pulled up. This is my story when I have a patient.
Once on @DATE1, I took a test called @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS1). My friends and I started using @ORGANIZATION1 early on. So we also have to be patient. We have a lot to do, but limited options. Patience is hard, sometimes it feels like the years have passed, but really @NUM1 minutes have passed, sometimes patience takes a lot of mental peace. One time my dad and I were going to work at @LOCATION1. The bus is @NUM2 minutes late, but it feels like weeks. Sometimes patience is good or bad. Good patience is when the team scores, the audience has enough patience for the team to score. Bad patience is when you're late for work, there's traffic, or the bus is late, or you can wait. Sometimes you can distract yourself from being patient, texting, calling a friend, talking, or playing a game, whether with your kids or yourself. So you see that patience is good or bad, and it also takes a lot of mental peace. @org1.
When I was around @NUM1. I went to @CAPS1 for a family reunion with grandpa, grandma, mom and dad and we stopped so many times I can't even count. I think yes but I don't want to stop or be patient because I want to go there and see everything looks big but dad's post is we have to leave the dog home for a week and be patient because I'm a I'm going to sleep when I get home. We got up at @TIME1 to leave the house and we arrived at the motel after noon at @TIME2 I'm tired of sitting in the car I don't want to get back in the car to go home because if you think it's a long way in the car to be white. I'm super impatient because if I could get there in half an hour, or one would be much better than @NUM2 hours, but it's fun to see new things you've never seen before you're on your way there , because on the way home. I'm just sleeping. But I'm not very patient, I'm very patient, I change cars every time I park, I didn't tating at the time, but I did have my @CAPS2 until it died, and then I made my my pods and my Cell all I can do is make phone calls and play games, but I'm so impatient in the corner because I'd rather go to a hotel to sleep than sit there and talk to the elderly about what's going on. I hardly know any of them and I can't tell you who each of them is.
Once I was patient while waiting to get on the computer, I told my mom to wake me up if she got the computer, an hour later I fell asleep, and after a while I woke up and my brother drove for three hours to read us already owned magazine, three minutes later my dad kicked me out to check his email, he said he would be leaving soon but he spent the rest of the next day looking at indearath stars more ( Although he spends 8 hours at work connecting for six hours, every day of the year adds @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the Internet.
There is someone I really like, and after @NUM1 years and @NUM2 ½ weeks, I finally have the courage to ask. He said he could go to the dance with me, but not out. So after a while, like a week later, I asked him again. He told me to give him until the weekend. So I wait and wait ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Then my friend couldn't take it, she asked him on @DATE1 and he said yes! A million yes, joy comes from his mouth. Then @DATE2, after getting to know me better, he broke up with me. We've been fighting since then, but are still good friends!
It's hard to be patient, not everyone has it, but patience is a very important thing. Almost everywhere you go, you have to be patient, like waiting in a line. You have to be patient with people, like people who are learning or people you are teaching. I'm very patient with @ORGANIZATION1, it's really hard to do. When I was four or five, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My sister wants to go for a ride, but I can't because I'm too short. So my mom is with me while my sister and my @CAPS1 keep riding. I was sad but my mom told me to wait and not get angry. After a while I started asking "when will mom finish the ride" and she kept answering "I don't know, when will @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 get off." @CAPS2 I can't wait, but when my @CAPS1 and my sister When they got out of the car, they told my mom they wanted to go again. My mom said "Okay" and when I was sad she said to me "But because you waited so long and it was fine, I'll take you to a smoothie." "I love smoothies" I pointed Call. Patience is important because I am very patient and my mom gave me something I liked. Patience is a hard thing to do, but once you have it, it's a good thing.
Last year I went to the doctor for a normal check up and she tested my vision and hearing and also got a cold. She put it on my chest to see if my heart is @CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her cold fingers on my neck for about a minute and she said she would be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asked "what's going on here". They say the glands in my neck are full, they say I need to check my blood to see if I have a goiter, it's the glands in your neck that are full and that's causing you to have to take medication for the rest of your life. So a few days later, we went to get my blood checked. I started getting really nervous as we waited and my butterflies were so bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour and they called me in and I sat down and the nurse said everything would be ok. So I trust her and she took a rubber tube and tied it to my arm and it hurt a bit and then @NUM2…@NUM3…@NUM4…the needle went in and I saw the blood going into the tube was really cool, Then we went home. Lost insomnia for a whole week because I was so anxious they called my mom and it took about a year and she couldn't really see her expression and then she said no and that was so happy and I was patient , which makes me want to run down and see myself!
"When will I get the Xbox!" I asked @CAPS1. "@CAPS2 hours," he replied. "@CAPS3!" "Yes." "@CAPS4." "@CAPS4." @CAPS2 hours... I think, this will feel like a week. First, I got on the computer. Ten minutes later, I got out of the car because there was nothing? ? ? . Next I looked at the TV Guide. there is nothing. Why am I so tired! I think. It must be me..., I was thinking, but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. I looked at the TV Guide again and still nothing. I just turned on the TV. @PERSON1 just finished. "@CAPS7's next in @CAPS8 land is @PERSON1," the @CAPS8 ad said. "@CAPS10 see this," I exclaimed. The result was better than I expected. This is colorless @PERSON1 about a cop and his son. After four hours of watching @PERSON1, I heard the door open. I heard @CAPS1 come in and say, "@CAPS12 got it!" @CAPS13 and I said, "@CAPS14" and fell asleep. "@CAPS15 wake him up." @CAPS1 whispered.
Once my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is understanding and listening to difficulties without complaining. Our family lives in @LOCATION1 and are planning a vacation to Cedar Point. We played all day at @NUM1 and we continued @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 uses blue @ORGANIZATION1 while other family members use red. Blue keeps you ahead at @NUM2 feet and drops you, while red shoots you to @NUM3 feet. The red @ORGANIZATION1 line is shorter than the blue one, so we have to go ahead first. @PERSON1 is already on top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1 after the ride. We hear a loud voice indicating that the blue @ORGANIZATION1 actor is coming down. But the blue cast didn't drop. @PERSON1 is stuck on top, @NUM4 feet tall. @PERSON1 has a bird's eye view of the park. If I were @PERSON1 I would be scared. At @NUM5, the riding lights come on and the cast plummets. Finally, he got into the car. Get a free season pass at Cedar Point with every ride. This is when @PERSON1 needs to show patience.
On @DATE1 we went to the doll tree I wanted to go to the play station. But I was patient, and we went to the game station.
At first, I woke up from my sleep feeling sick, @CAPS1 I took a shower and got dressed. I told my dad "Can I see a doctor if I don't feel well?"? ? ? @CAPS1 He said "We're leaving @NUM1 am" and now @NUM2 am. Then I had to wait on the couch while my brother, dad and mom were talking about the shower. After that, I want to yell and complain because they're going so slow, trying to make @CAPS1 pretty. @CAPS1 I don't. Once done, they have to hunt for the key until they find it. It was @NUM3 am, my dad's favorite music was at @CAPS1, and we stayed to watch the whole movie. In the middle, it's @NUM4 am and then we go to the doctor and have to wait for everyone's turn there until it's our @NUM5. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me, but nothing. @CAPS1 I'm off, I'm still waiting until my brothers is done. In the end, I was pissed off by @CAPS1 because I had to wait for them to get in the car. Dad said, "Are you happy? You said you didn't feel well, there was nothing wrong with you." @CAPS1 We came home thinking I'd been patient all day. I said to myself, "I've learned my lesson, and if you're patient, the day will go by quickly."
On @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 to visit my aunt @CAPS1. @CAPS2 Wake up early and drive to @LOCATION4 My first flight. My dad said I better have patients or my journey will be boring, my sister got on a plane to @LOCATION3 it took @NUM1 mins, it was easy but then @CAPS2 got on another plane and went directly To @PERSON1, it took @NUM2 hours, I rode for a long time, but I have patience, but my sister didn't have any patients at all throughout the trip, she asked which @CAPS2 would get there. At that time, I had patients.
Once I was patient. @CAPS7 is going camping so @CAPS7 packed up and found the car has @NUM1 hours so I have to be patient. I played @CAPS4 ps @NUM2 for a few minutes, this is @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 left early so @CAPS7 can do something when @CAPS7 arrives. Then I tried @CAPS1 and I was hooked. But I can sift and yell with @CAPS4 casins @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 and I finally fall asleep. And then @CAPS7 hits @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 runs out @CAPS7 is there? ? ? It took @CAPS7 an hour to fix it, so @CAPS7 meanders over @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS7 lefe. And then @CAPS4 cusims are all excited @CAPS5 @CAPS6 "@CAPS7 are all on top" I'm glad I can pitch @CAPS4 tent and go to @CAPS13. I saw the camp and when @CAPS7 arrived @CAPS7 had to put everything in place and I had to patiently go to @CAPS13 and the kids found a bunch of cores. @CAPS9 wants to go to @CAPS4 Mom wants me to take them, I'm so nervous, I @CAPS8 don't want to go to @CAPS9? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? So @CAPS7 stay at @CAPS10 @CAPS11 shouting the park is close to the campsite and I can eat @CAPS10 asap on q ouit if pose ul and fank are @CAPS4 tant @CAPS3 and @CAPS13.
I'm patient when I'm going to Cedar Point. We spent seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided to watch a movie on @CAPS2. We watched street dreams and unbelievable things. We are a long way from Cedar Point. We decided to give my mom a prank call. It was fun so we did it again. Then we took turns taking naps and looking at the open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. When we wake up, we are there. This is when I wait patiently. Since I wait patiently, I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do other things while I waited. Now I can wait longer. This will help me in the future.
I am very patient while eating. I'm patient because I'm done early and a lot of people haven't done it yet. When I finish early I like to draw or do some of my work but I don't have any work so I'm new and then when everyone is done we wait @NUM1 minutes and then when I finish everyone else , we start again the meap is done, so I wait @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes and then everyone is done, then we stretch and walk @NUM4 minutes, then we sit down and start the @NUM5 portion, and when we're done, We start work and I'm usually the first to finish. And then when I finish the test I get up and walk around so I can get @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in my test like the meap test because it's very important to get good grades and when you have patience you will find You'll get better yourself @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 tiers.
On my last trip @CAPS1 point I made a terrible mistake. I queued @NUM1 hours on the Mantis. I have to be patient, but it's hard because... Mr. Fan has technical difficulties. How can I be patient when it's @NUM2 degrees outside? ! The only good part of this line is the shadow. That's my @NUM3 way of being patient. ' I told myself, 'You'll be there soon. "@CAPS2 I said it too soon. Half an hour seems like @NUM4 hours, but I think the heat is just looking for me. Finally, after queuing for @NUM5 hours, the fog fans @DATE1 lifted. Patience brings good luck. I waited for what seemed like ten minutes, but it was actually an hour. After getting out of the car, I was released. I guess in some ways patience is the key to success.
One day, a man named @PERSON1 had a doctor's appointment and overslept; when @PERSON1 woke up, he saw that his doctor's appointment was late. When @PERSON1 got up, he rushed into the bathroom and took a shower as if he had time. @PERSON1 noticed it was roasting later, so he didn't have time to wash or brush his teeth, so he grabbed some of the gum on the way out. @PERSON1 finally got to the doctor and went in and saw millions of people in the waiting room, he went to check his name and sat down. He was starting to get frustrated and tired of waiting, so he calmed down and realized patience. @PERSON1 has been busy playing with his phone and the many apps he has downloaded for two hours. @PERSON1 was so busy he didn't realize he was the last one still waiting. Others checked and left, others left without checking. Finally, they call @LOCATION1 to make an appointment. When @PERSON1 went in, he put @NUM1, maybe @NUM2 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @PERSON1 done, flew home, flew into his shower, brushed his teeth, and went back to bed.
Patience is very difficult for me. It's very difficult for me to be patient because I have no patience at all: can't wait for things. When I was in school, I always looked at my watch. I just can't wait to get out of class most of the time. Sometimes I feel like I'm a little too rushed. I wish I had the patience, but I don't. I'm impatient because I'm so curious about what to expect after the wait. Example: In class, I get excited for the end of the day. One day, I want to improve the way I wait. I don't think this will happen anytime soon.
Patience is important in my family. My mom always said you have to be patient to succeed. Once I was at home playing on the computer. I surf the web and enjoy it. My mom was yelling at me to see her in the house. I got off the chair. Through the kitchen, through the hallway, into her bedroom. She said she had to go to @CAPS1 to get some groceries. She wondered if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked if she would make herself a sandwich. She answered yes and left. When she left, I cleaned my room. Folder laundry and watching TV. It's about @DATE1 and she's still not home. I was hungry and started worrying about her. I was tempted to call her, but then I remembered that she always said that it takes patience to succeed. About half an hour @DATE1 she got home. She bought me some lunch meat so I could make sandwiches. As I ate, she told me she was proud of my patience while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more.
In my words, a patient is someone who waits when needed. The only reason I'm raising this question in my own way is because I know my family has patience. Pations is a person who, if they are stuck in traffic, then they can sit and wait, or wait a long time or queue. Or they will be able to wait for what they need. The patient is just waiting for my turn and I should take it. If I had to wait, or if something ran out, they had to wait for it to come. This is what patients mean to me in my own way.
I'm going to tell you a time when I was impatient. I work @DATE1 every day. I try to make as much money as I can. I saved three hundred dollars on a bow, fifty dollars on a target, and forty dollars on a broadband and other hunting accessories. I find myself getting more impatient every day. Slowly, I got tired of working, tired of saving money, and wanted to spend it. Finally got enough money. I bought my stuff. I practice all day. Soon I became more accurate. I am ready to go hunting. The first night I was out, I missed a doe eight yards. Since then, I haven't had anything close enough to shoot.
The one time I have patience is when the camera is flying around. I had to go to this place to get flying footage. When we got there, we queued and I had to be patient because the queue was really long was it? ? ? the line to go through. We brought chairs, hot coffee and staff to keep our feet on. I had to be patient and tell me that I was at the front of the line. To make matters worse most of the tide was outside and it was the eve of @CAPS1 so I had to be patient in the cold and when we finally got into the building I was happy. Then around @DATE1, we got to the front of the line. I'm glad I no longer have to stand in line for three hours to get flight footage again.
I'm patiently waiting for my game to take a long time to get mine so I get my big bucks because. Made me mad, then my mom came up with her suggestion that I got mom's money off stilts, she bought me my house, she took her way, and I'm patiently over now. I have the patience to go to lunch I have @NUM1 b lunch so I have @NUM2 huse to go to lunch so now don't guess @NUM3 hours I will have lunch I'm pissed? ? ? @NUM4 until now for lunch, when to do the test so forgot to ask some games it 's @NUM5 we go to lunch it @NUM6 we go to lunch now hear the line I asked him to be patient? ? ? she me we she made my sleb eat well and i would eat it then dinck my milk then we try to be patient? ? ? I was misunderstood and I am happier than ever.
One time I was very patient was when I was practicing basketball. It didn't happen until the end. No one knew this would happen. It just happened suddenly. I hit a wall. I had an accident. We are killing ourselves. I ran so fast I couldn't stop. I plunged my head into the wall. It was also a brick wall. I didn't panic because I knew I had to be patient. I have to wait for a lot of things. I had to wait for an ambulance and it took a long time. I had to wait for the doctor to give me stitches and it didn't take long. In the end, I had to wait for the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened to @ORGANIZATION1. We do basketball practice in the gym. It's on @DATE1, but I don't remember the exact date. I am also in sixth grade. This is because I can't stop in time. It didn't hurt when I hit my head. When I stitched, some parts were injured. It didn't hurt when they took them out. But I have a terrible headache. I'm happy when it's all over.
I am a very patient person. An example is games. For some games, you have to wait weeks or months. For others, you may have to wait years. I have done it before.
I have had to be patient many times in my life. The one I remember was the long queue for @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 to open for this @DATE1. The row must have at least @NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchards in the area where I live. This is my first time going, but my sister has been there countless times before. She said it was one of the scariest things she's ever experienced. She also brought a friend. Her name is @PERSON1. Opening Ceremony will be at @TIME1 with only @NUM2 and the team behind us is still growing. My heart is beating faster and faster. I look at my watch almost every @NUM3 seconds. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally @NUM4. Just then, we heard a notification. beep! “@CAPS4 Ladies and Gentlemen! I am sorry to announce that we will be opening @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 minutes. Sorry. Thank you for your cooperation” clicked. I heard everyone in line moaning. A lot of people just leave and come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sit back and wait for it to end. Finally, we heard the last announcement. beep! "@CAPS4 again! Are you ready for @CAPS3? Then come in! Time to @CAPS3 @CAPS9!" That's my story of patience.
Waiting for my baby is the longest @NUM1 hours of my life. I was in the waiting room almost all the time. The nurse kept giving me updates to calm me down but to no avail. So I @CAPS1 took a cigarette to ease my nerves. I don't know if my wife or our children will live. Will you be happy? I just @CAPS1 took a puff and sat for hours shutting out the rest of the world to protect my own mind. Will you be picked? I sat, ignoring the nurse's pleas, trying to reassure me. Will it close life? I sat and waited for my newborn baby. A baby's cry broke my silence. I rushed to my wife's room to find her holding a beautiful baby girl. "@CAPS1 you've been long enough"
The time I have the patience is when my family loves @CAPS1 avencher and @CAPS2 keeps going and makes me shudder at the biggest coster in the park. "@CAPS2 line up", I said to a kid who cut in front of my friend @PERSON1 and me, as @CAPS2 climbed the ramp and got into the car. The kid ran to the back behind the gusting line, @CAPS3 and the kids sremed. When @CAPS2 climbs to the top of the ramp the harp goes up so @CAPS2 sets about a hower in there and then they fix it @CAPS2 comes in and I'm taking off my glasses. The car was stunned. They @CAPS2 climbed the Digestive Mountain and got smaller and smaller! Then there is a trend, the last hill. Ended up riding @NUM1 mph like a diver, it was a time to be patient
We drive to @LOCATION1. My uncle lives there, so since he always comes to our house, we're going to his new home. I'm excited to go there, but have a problem, it's a 10+ hour drive. The morning we left, my parents woke me up and I was very tired. I looked at the clock and it showed six thirty in the morning. I knew we didn't bring a lot of food and stuff, so we packed up and got into the van, but it seemed to take longer to last. My dad said we would be leaving around 7:30, but we had an hour more than we planned. We all packed our bags and we hit the road. After about an hour, I fell asleep in the back seat. We stopped for an hour and @DATE1 I woke up. After we got back, my annoyance watched a movie on our portable DVD player. We kept driving there and I knew it would take a while, but I was patient and fell asleep most of the time. When we got to @DATE1, it felt great. Their house is on the hill, I have fans visiting them, and we walk around town to shop. I am very happy to meet my uncle and aunt. This is my time to be patient.
My family goes to @CAPS1.I when I have the patience. Adventure, we all want to go off the water slide. The biggest water slide there. It has the longest line Cher and it makes a swirl and my family is at the end of the swirl. I was early in the morning when we finally got in and headed off the water slide. About @NUM1 feet tall. We queued, and after only half an hour, my mother let it go. After another half an hour, my brother left. Right now it's just my other brother, my sister, and my dad is in line. When someone was injured on the trip and closed for two hours. In the end they opened the journey again, so now my other sibling is not coming with us. So now only my dad and I are left in line. So it was our turn to ride next, and when my dad left, I was in the same blimp with an old man and kept going. The old man met his pace, and I'm glad I finally hit the road.
Patience is important and it can help you succeed in many things. Patience is very important in school because some things just have to wait. It's important to be patient in a game of chess or checkers because when someone else makes his or her move, you can think about what action you'll take to counter it. Patience is very important when playing games or doing homework. Patience is also about waiting. For example, @CAPS1 Eve everyone is excited and can't wait until morning, but they have to be patient until morning. Also on your birthday you don't know what you're going to get, but you don't have to peek you have to be patient, you can open the gift. Patience is a very useful skill
“@CAPS1! Today is the day we get to @CAPS2,” @CAPS3 @PERSON1 exclaimed. "@CAPS4 on @PERSON1, let's watch this show on the road." @CAPS5 announced. @CAPS6 is planning to go on vacation to @CAPS7 point @CAPS22 @DATE1 is long and today is the day they have to go. The family got @CAPS22 suitcases and stacked them in the car. When everything was in place, they took off. "@CAPS8 @CAPS11, how long will this drive take?" asked @PERSON1's sister @CAPS9. "@CAPS10, about six hours, dear." @CAPS11 replied. @CAPS6 lives in @LOCATION1, @CAPS21 they have to drive to @LOCATION2. “@CAPS13 @CAPS11!!! I can’t live 6 hours in the car!!!” @CAPS14 @CAPS9 you want to be here @CAPS4, you just need to be as patient as @CAPS3 @PERSON1. " I don't think I will wait." ” @CAPS15 was in the car for about three hours and @CAPS9 kept repeating "Are we there yet?" " @CAPS16 She asked even though the answer was always "@CAPS17." @CAPS3 @PERSON1 eventually got annoyed by it and yelled "Stop! Please wait! ", "@CAPS18, @CAPS18," @CAPS9 replied, "I'll stop. "@CAPS15 About two hours later, they finally arrived. Parents bought tickets and asked the kids what car they wanted to take. They all laughed and said: "@CAPS20." " @CAPS21 They walked up to the line. They just waited, waited. A little more. @CAPS15 waited in line for four hours, @CAPS9 gave up, yelling "I don't want to stand in line anymore!" I am leaving! ” The @CAPS21 family walked back into the car and drove away. When they were settled, @PERSON1 told @CAPS9, “@CAPS22 needs some patience, you can have fun. " @CAPS9 did not respond.
One day @PERSON1's mom, "@CAPS1" decided to go shopping and @PERSON1 wanted to go. But his mom kept saying @CAPS2. So @PERSON1 begged his mom to finally say, "@CAPS3 but you can't complain" so @PERSON1 went shopping with his mom. Then @PERSON1 and his mom came to the store. Pretty much what @DATE1 @PERSON1 said. "I'm the board can we go now", his mom @CAPS4 @CAPS2 Please bear with me. @PERSON1 then said, "Be patient, you want me to be patient we've been here for @DATE1 hours" and we've only been here for ten @DATE1. I have @CAPS2 more patients say @PERSON1. So his mom made a deal with @PERSON1 and if you're good for @NUM1 more @DATE1 we'll go to an ice cream shop. Next @NUM1 @DATE1 drives his mom crazy every second @PERSON1 says I'm the board, we can go now, hurry up. Finally @PERSON1 and his mom left. They got in the car and drove past the ice cream shop and @PERSON1 said, "Wait" we passed and his mom said I know. @PERSON1 said "we made a deal, remember. Mom said yes, but you broke the deal, so what you learned. @PERSON1 said when you made a deal to sign a contract, his mom said, "@CAPS2" patient It's a virtue you need to learn. That's the story I tell my patients in my own way.
When I have the patience is when I take the @CAPS1 test for @NUM1 grade. In my class, there are only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders, the rest are @NUM4. So we tested it in the principal's office. That was the day we had to take part in writing. They are hard and take a while. When we started, some people were going to get things done as fast as they could. I take the time to plan what I'm going to write. We have a lot of time, so you should use most of your time to make everything beautiful. To do this, you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should review your answer again and make sure your answer is correct. When I finished the writing part, I checked it to make sure I got everything right. I have a lot of time. When I'm done correcting me, I wait for others to do the same by reading. That's when I'm patient.
The patient is everything, heard it! When you're waiting in line to try a restaurant, or when you're stuck in traffic. You are pissed, pissed off, but the words come to your mind. "Patience is everything", once I was in a long line to see the order counter! I'm in a hurry, I have a class and I have to finish it in five minutes. When I could go to the counter, I saw the staff running around trying to get all the orders. Then I saw the reason for holdap. At the front of the line was an old man trying desperately to order. I don't blame him, all these choices, he doesn't know what to pick, the losing line is not so patient, "Come on." One said "Come on." @CAPS1 Another I just wait patiently, this line is not fair. I suggested an option for him and he ordered. Of course I'm @NUM1 minutes late for class but I'm patient and understanding with seniors who say what's going on around them and the rest of the time I feel good about my good deeds
Are you always patient and even sometimes? If not your normal. @CAPS1 - @CAPS1. But everyone on @LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help you in the long run. If you and I are patient, it will be easier for us. Like your brother in your bathroom, you have to use it. You can wait for him to finish. It's about saving arguments and patience. I say these things like "I have patience!" But that would be a lie because I'm so far from it! Not that it's easy, but we're all working on it.
@PERSON1 is a hamster. One day @PERSON1 came out of the cage to play with his owner's sister hamster @PERSON1. @PERSON1 just bought a brand new hamster toy. @CAPS5 There's a bunch of tubes to climb in, and a slide and rollers. @PERSON1 wish he had one, @CAPS1 his owner doesn't have enough money yet. Even though @PERSON1 is in his game, he still wants one. @CAPS5 makes it hard for @PERSON1 to wait, especially when @PERSON1 sees @PERSON1 playing in his game. This is the story of when @PERSON1 was talking to @PERSON1, I wish I had a hamster toy" @PERSON1 said. @CAPS1 My owner doesn't have enough money!" "@CAPS2 Don't worry," @PERSON1 said. You can play mine until he plays. I hear he's had enough. " @CAPS3, that's close enough, I think. "A few days later, @PERSON1 got brand new toys, never more than @CAPS4," I guess @CAPS5 was worth the wait! @CAPS5 is twice as big as @PERSON1, so they can hold. And they both lived happily ever after.
I'm not a very patient person, so I'll be wondering about @CAPS6's patience. Be patient @CAPS6 and don't complain when you're boarding or waiting. For example (for your convenience, I @CAPS1 is writing a story about patience, please note that this story @CAPS6 is completely untrue) @CAPS1 was walking home and saw an old woman who was having trouble with the grocery store . @CAPS1 wants to help her but all he thinks about is his cousin @CAPS2, @CAPS4 will be at his house anytime now. @CAPS1 walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help, she replied "if you could live on @CAPS3", pointing to a large tan house. @CAPS1 brought her stuff to the door. "@CAPS3 you go," he said. "@CAPS4, would you mind putting them away for me" the woman asked. @CAPS1 thought his mom never wanted him in a stranger's house, but @CAPS1 kinda knew her so he said he @CAPS4 helped that woman smile. @CAPS1 then picked up the bag and said, "@CAPS6 your home is unlocked" "@CAPS7 not" she replied, where are your keys? @CAPS1 searched for about half an hour, then he found them under the bushes. He gave her the key and said, "@CAPS3 you go," she opened the door and he helped her get her groceries. When they were all put away, @CAPS1 said "@CAPS11 I should go." "@CAPS11 ain't no somway I can repay you" woman said, "@CAPS13 get my wallet." @CAPS1 waited and waited, Must be an hour. The woman came out of the kitchen with some changes. "@CAPS15 This is the only change, I can't find my wallet," she said, giving him the change. @CAPS1 feels like a good guy because he is patient with this woman. @CAPS1 told his mom about his good deeds and his cousin @CAPS2 has to stay longer. This is my example of patience, if this happens to you, make sure your patient and know this person.
Go home one day? ? ? Movie we were stopped @CAPS1 I trained a train. only? ? ? Is it??? Or do we think I'm big after me??? @CAPS1 came and he and my old ??? had at least @NUM1 mints in the car, but the train showed signs of ending. But suddenly it stopped and the train fell on the tracks. We turn around. But the @ORGANIZATION1 car is about @NUM2 mint blades? ? ? Soon after the train ended, the @NUM3 mints started slowly. After @CAPS2 went up, we started driving, but another train came. So my dad put the ??? into the ??? and ??? it was there and we were very patient. Sick? ? ? We spent @NUM4 mints in almost an hour? ? ? But we were patient and she longed to date forever.
I have to be patient as we drive to @CAPS1. I really have to be patient when we're in the car because it takes @NUM1 hours plus extra time for us to go to the bathroom, go out to lunch, plus we stay overnight. But it's so @CAPS2 when we're on the road, that's how I need patience. I have to bring a car bag to entertain me. I contain a book, pages of paper. So is my dad's laptop. A big factor is my ipod. Apparently I don't like my legs got all? ? ? and? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? hate that feeling. But the end result I love? ? ? You just have to be patient enough to get there, the final factor is the best.
A day at my school. It's lunch and I'm hungry. The lunch was packed with kids. I can hear my stomach rumbling and I'm so hungry. I stood for ten minutes and then I started thinking maybe I could cut it. But no, I didn't. It feels like an hour has passed. I'm still waiting as patiently as possible. Then I realized that the line was moving faster and faster. until I finally got my food and ate it. I only have a five minute break, but I am happy to eat. patient by
I know a very patient person. That man was seeing a doctor when she was six years old, and she was still waiting. They can fix this by asking nicely that I can get ahead of you. This will address everything in a friendly and offensive way. That's how I think respectful.
I remember waiting almost @NUM1 hours at the walking clinic @CAPS1 when I was six so I asked if they could change the @LOCATION1 channel to @ORGANIZATION1 after @CAPS2 was over I @CAPS3 fell asleep @CAPS2 @CAPS5 just Like forever @CAPS1 they say '' @CAPS6 salslory, "My mom tried to wake me up and didn't wake me up until I @CAPS7 got out of their seats in the kids. I'm at the walk clinic @CAPS1 there cause my athsmua @CAPS2 Not good @CAPS1 for a while because I was sick. When they called me dawm my mom said I was really patient and nurse Evan said I was actually patient and patient for that long so she gave me one Lollipop Pop, (small). After all of this, I went home and went to bed. That was two hours of my being a Patient @CAPS1.
I know the patient person is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people I know. Especially on this day. Every once in a while, my siblings and I have a hard time dealing with it. We were on our way to church and when my brother and I started arguing and fighting, we were always arguing and interrupting each other for no reason. My youngest brother and sister were constantly screaming and yelling at each other for stupid reasons, like he stuck his tongue out at me...she pinched me. And then we finally got to the church and I guess my mom thought it would stop once we got there, but without my three year old brother @PERSON1 running around and throwing church over and over again. My eldest brother kept calling my sister's name and I kept chatting with my friends. I know I'm not going to be that patient with anyone. So that's why I think my mom is very patient. After church that afternoon, all she told us to do was be good, and after we realized how patient she was, we just thought to ourselves, we should listen to her and be good.
One day at the market, I was very patient. I want to ride a bumper car. So I lined up. There are about @NUM1 people in front of me, so I know I'll have to be patient. So I waited in line until it was my turn. They let @NUM2 people in at a time, so it took me a while to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends so we had some people in front of us. Then after @NUM3 minutes it was our turn to pick a car and had a great time. That's when I'm patient.
My mom broke her wrist while we were cycling down the trail during @DATE1. At the end of the path, Mom turned a corner too quickly and turned her hand over. I didn't know she had a broken wrist until she got up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one in my family had ever broken a bone before, so I didn't know what to do. Mom told me calmly that we had to ride our bikes to the car because we were driving. As we rode the bike to the car, Mom didn't say how much pain she was or anything. I had to put the bike in the back seat when we got in the car. Now for those who don't know, the bikes are a bit heavy and it's a bit difficult to put them in the back seat of the car. Also, when your mom has a broken bone and is in a lot of pain, and the bike isn't running on the back seat, it can get pretty stressful. My mom was upset when she saw me, calmed me down and instructed me on how to put the bike in. After that, my mom asked me to get my glasses and we accidentally left it on the road. I ran desperately to get her glasses, but they were broken. So I ran all the way back to the car and because we had the same vision, I gave her the glasses. My mom needed glasses because I didn't have them and she had to drive herself to the ER and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room, we had to wait a while for someone to see us. I freaked out, but mom was actually joking about how she got hurt while doing something healthy (like exercising). I admire my mom's patience and calm in this situation. She didn't complain or complain about her pain. She didn't yell at me when I put the bike in the car. Although I'm almost going to overventilate there. She calmly told me it was okay and helped me move on. It was like I was the one who got hurt and she was taking me to the ER like a mom as always. I know for a fact that if I break my wrist, I can't handle the situation well. I know I'll be crying all the time and hope someone can help me soon. I am amazed at my mother's understanding and tolerance. I wish I could do the same.
When I went to the doctor for an injection one day, my mother said I was very patient. My mom took me to the doctor so I could get my flu shot like I always did, and when we got in the car I kept saying "do we really have to go" and of course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a bit and my mom had to get the papers so I just stood there watching the fish swim around and my mom said 'let's go to the waiting room''. Afterwards she said I had been patiently waiting except when I was complaining in the car. So I said thank you, when are we going in. And then when we finally got there, I had to weigh in and get asked all these questions. The nurse came in and injected me in my left arm with these pictures. She said you're pretty much the only patient patient with children. That's the story of when I was patient. .
Some people are very patient. Others are not. Some people have short attention spans. Patience is an understanding and forgiving person. They have difficulty without complaining. Some people sit still or wait for something to go wrong. They are impatient. There is a saying that patience is a virtue. Many people have heard of it. Be patient and wait for @NUM1 hours in line to watch a movie without having to walk around. Patience is not pacing back and forth. It's good to be patient with questions.
I @DATE1 and my family went to @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3 had to wait a long time after @CAPS3 arrived at the airport. So @CAPS3 at the airport, ready to leave for @LOCATION1 when the flight was delayed due to early morning thunderstorms. @CAPS6 took a long time, every minute seemed like an hour, and half an hour later @CAPS1 I asked for breakfast for some money, but of course my mom said, "@CAPS2." I was about to lose @CAPS6, this When this guy walks past the speaker, "@CAPS3 will have to delay the flight to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 a little bit more." @CAPS4 When I remembered I had a @CAPS5 in my bag, I went to open @CAPS6 and @CAPS6 is dead. An hour later the storm stopped and @CAPS3 was able to board. From that day on, I discovered that I am not a patient person.
This is a story about patience, one day my friend told me you have no patience. I told him no, I've never been a patient in my life, you should tell me. One day my friend told me my new game was coming out and I just said why he said that and I could see he didn't like it at all, so in class I told everyone I won him in the game. But I don't have a patient, so I bite the bullet and complain to him that I said I won and he said you're impatient and keep going. Then another friend of mine said stop it now! I'm tired of you having no patients, you lost @NUM1 games! Well, there are times in our lives that we all complain! Please stop fighting. So the next day I said what do you have to tell me and I will hear better now. I knew I should have listened to what people had to say and said would get the friend ship to the next level.
Some people say that patience is the key to life. I really don't know if it is. Patience is something you can wait for when you are equal. This is when you can do tough things without feeling down, angry, or sad. When you have patience, you can do things easily, you can do things without difficulty. Patience is self-esteem, kindness and fairness, not selfishness. Forbearance is respect rather than disrespect, forbearance without evil, and without boasting. Patience doesn't lie, it makes things better when it's difficult. It makes it easier for you to concentrate and do things better. It helps to wait for things.
When I think about being patient, I think about when I went south to play hockey at @LOCATION1 and we spent @NUM1 ½ hours on the way! I didn't say how long or what as we were on the way there, although I was on a claster bus with all my hockey friends watching a hockey movie. When I think about patients, I think about not asking "@CAPS1 is it done?" or "Are we there yet?" I don't have the best patients myself. When I want a computer or play the role of a guard or a flaville, and someone is doing those things, I tend to ask "when is he going to get old!" a lot. As you develop, the patient grows with you, and as you get older, you will be able to wait longer without the stress of everything taking so long even though this test requires a patient!
It all started on a cold and snowy @DATE1 with just two days left until @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights in the colors of the rainbow. This time of year, people are happy too. I'm always impatiently waiting for @CAPS1 to @CAPS6. I'm going to be patient this year. @CAPS4 I started patiently shopping with my mom for new lights @CAPS1 trees and gifts for my family. When we shop, there are all kinds of people in the store. @CAPS4 When we got to the checkout line, there were a lot of people in line. My mom also told me to be patient, @CAPS4 I did. When we finally got out of the store, we rushed home to start decorating. I offered to blow up @LOCATION1, it's going to take a long time, but I'll have to be patient. Finally @CAPS6 to make the cookies, that's the best part. We cut the dough and put it in the oven. They take a long time to cook. My mom said just be patient. ''@CAPS4 I was patient and the cookies ended up being fasted and sprinkled with some water. All done, we're ready @CAPS1. ''@CAPS6 on @CAPS1,'' I said to myself. I need patience or @CAPS1 will never @CAPS6. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS10 Everyone came over to have dinner with us and got the gifts I bought them. When everyone left, I walked to my room, don't remember it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10. Then when I got up late and everyone was waiting for me, I was excited: @CAPS13 I was patient and it paid off.
Patience means you are understanding and forgiving. I am patient when I go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. When I got to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I had to wait in line. I don't have to wait that long but I have to wait, I don't like it, but I'm patin. It's worth the wait. I had to wait in line for food as there were so many people in line. That's worth the wait too. The food there is good. This is how I use my patient life skill. Patience is a great life skill.
one time. My cousin is patient as she's going to a party at mouie @CAPS1. @CAPS1 she has a lot of kids @CAPS1 she has to clean the house before mom comes home. Also @CAPS2 she called our whole mom that day but they didn't pick up @CAPS2 She hurry up @CAPS1 trying to clean up before his boyfriend came over. Then she hurry @CAPS1 into the tub and come out and put the kids @CAPS1 in the tub. She still has to clean up and then she what we clean up. @CAPS2 She rushed out @CAPS1 and left us there while she went to get us something to eat @CAPS2 We cleaned while we were. she left. Then she called me and said. I was on my way to bring food and I said oh. Next her boyfriend comes to @CAPS1 and he's ready to go. She came back and the house was clean. Then her mom came home @CAPS2 went into the room to change and her mom said where to go. She said to mouie and a party, her mom said no, you don't go to the bathroom first, she got mad, mom said I'd stay at home all day, I'm ready. @CAPS2 She washed it to @CAPS1 and they left.
Patience is when one is understanding and forgiving. Well, I'm going to tell you a patient man. My friend @PERSON1 is a very patient person. @PERSON1 understands that when someone asks her to wait, she listens and waits. When her parents were talking, when she tried to tell them something, they asked her to wait because it would be rude to interrupt an adult during a conversation. @PERSON1 is a very patient person.
My birthday is coming up when I have the patience. I wish my party came sooner. But my parents kept saying no. @CAPS1 The party is here and I got all the presents except my parents. They say @CAPS1 everyone leaves they'll give it to me. But no one left before ten o'clock. So I fell asleep. When I woke up, no one got up. So I still have to wait. (I hate waiting.) @CAPS1 My mom got up and I asked if I could open my present and she said wait until your dad gets up. @CAPS1 My dad finally woke up (@NUM1) and I finally got to open my present. It's worth the wait.
I woke up to the sound of an alarm on @PERSON1. This is @NUM1, my mom is on time? ? ? . I am in a hurry. Today is the day x-box @NUM2 comes out and I want it. My mom and I made a deal. If I had been patient while running the arch, I could have done it. An hour passed and we reached grcery state. I rushed in and grabbed a cart. My mother told me to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any sign of impatience. After a few hours, we were done and the next stop was the library. I can't do anything there without getting into trouble, I hate it. But I was soon on the bench. When we finally went to Best Buy to buy the x-box @NUM2, it was already dark. We went to get it and I was so excited! My mom said I had to endure all day and I deserved it.
This @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, the memorable part of @CAPS1 was the @NUM1 hour plane trip. All my friends are in a group of @NUM2 households. When we became our exit plane, the @CAPS1 at the gate was scattered all over the place. So on that trip, I sat down with my favorite @NUM3 friends. We are all treated as lightning bolts by the enemy. As we move on, I think @CAPS3 will be easy, @CAPS1 is wrong. At first @CAPS3 was fine, we chatted and played games in I pods and sorted, @CAPS1 after @NUM2 hours we started itching and our I pods died. So then we decided to watch a movie as our mind DVD player. @CAPS3 Low battery, plan broken. That thing is dead, we have @NUM2 hours left and we can only watch one movie. There is a TV behind every seat so we force @CAPS3 on, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 is @NUM6 ??? NO???. Are we really starting to see it? ? ? @CAPS3 late. We don't know what to do @CAPS3 is desperate. If sitting down was a real patient conversation, we had to sit and wait. we? ? ? @NUM3 homes? ? ? @CAPS3 is the longest @NUM3 horror ever. We did nothing. @CAPS1 As we wanted, we rushed out of our seats and read into the air that @CAPS3 is over. We don't have to be patient anymore.
Patients are hard for me, but this is when I have patience. This is the first day of school and the end of the day. At the end of the day, the volleyball tryouts were played. I want to try but I don't have my body. So while everyone was playing volleyball, me and @NUM1 others were sitting and watching @NUM2 @DATE1!!!. I wasn't impatient at the time, but @DATE1 my mom picked me up at the end of the tryouts and from there we went straight to the sports center doctor's office so I could finish my physical. So I went in with my mom and she had to sign and fill out the paperwork because she didn't make my full appointment. So this took about @NUM3 minutes. And then we waited, waited, waited until @NUM4 and @DATE1, if you add it up this @NUM2 @DATE1 is there waiting and nothing to do. I'm patient, but my mom definitely doesn't. So in the end they called me and they took my mom to a room and waited for them to measure my height and weight. Then they took me to my mom's room and we waited @NUM3 minutes. Then finally they gave us paper/physics and we left. Practice ends at @NUM7 and we don't get home until @NUM8! ! ! . That's when I'm patient.
Once I have the patience, I want to go and play football with my dad, but I don't want to. So when he puts on his shoes, when I invite him to play football, he takes off his flash. Then I had to wait two and a half hours for him to light one up. I didn't say anything when he batted the second time. When do we play football. This is how I learn if you use your patience to do something safe.
It was my mom when someone showed patience and she got mad at me when I was writing on the wall so my sister said she did so my mom has her patients listen to us and then she said you guys It's all in a lot of trouble because we're not better, she said, but we still have to clean everything for a week because she's been so patient with us, and that's how people I know show patients.
Patience @CAPS3 Forgiving feel. Having "patient" means you can wait, and as long as you wait, it will come to you. Like when you gobble up the food thinking it's going to be stolen by him, when in fact, you could have left it there, but it's still going to be there. Be patient @CAPS3 know @CAPS3 everything will be fine and you have time. Have the patience to do something, @CAPS3 take your time, or go at your own pace and believe you'll get it done. Patience @CAPS3 qenrally how long you can wait to do something or even put up with something. Patience may also mean that now you can put up with something, like bullying. He or she makes fun of you time and time again. But how much patience you have before you've just been pushed to the brink, you can't take it anymore! That' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Patience @CAPS3.
"@CAPS1 @PERSON1, it's @PERSON3, how are you"? "I'm @CAPS5, the upp of @CAPS24? @CAPS27, I'm calling you to ask if you want to go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with a man? "@CAPS4 ah"! "Long time no go"! Wait let me ask ". "@CAPS5". As I explained to her, @CAPS24 is happening. "@CAPS5, my grandma will pick you up"? "@CAPS7 @CAPS24 time"? "@CAPS8 @NUM1 points"! “See you @CAPS5, @CAPS29! Goodbye!! (@CAPS10 here) help us pack the cooler” “@CAPS5” (knock and bell) I turned it on “@CAPS12” @CAPS13 I miss you so much” "@CAPS14! " @CAPS15 Two @NUM2 hours we played the guitar. Hepo until we all passed out," @CAPS16 Girls time to get ready. " @CAPS17 Mom's up"! We're all ready, we're on the free road' @PERSON1 took silly pics with me, @CAPS29 asleep. @CAPS12 sleeps on me" @CAPS19 my eyes , "@CAPS20 right? I lost so we can all tell @PERSON3 to go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3"! I looked at my mom," "Are you kidding me? "@CAPS23", "The family is leaving." "The whole family?" @CAPS26 "Just @PERSON2, @PERSON4, you and I are going!" @CAPS24 About @CAPS25? "@CAPS26 she can go she has to work" "This is really bad mom" "I know." "When we go @CAPS27"? "Leaving @DATE1 and coming back that day" "No overnight stay"? "@CAPS23 we can't afford it"! “@CAPS29 How did you get @CAPS2 @CAPS3 votes?” “I won them on the radio” “@CAPS32, @CAPS5” “@CAPS27 Do I take people out loud? “Like who”?” I @CAPS35 maybe @CAPS12, can I make the call? Ask her if she can come? " "@CAPS37 is here!" ! As I scrolled through my mom's phone trying to find the phone number for "@CAPS38 @CAPS39's", I hit the send button and dialed. "@CAPS40"? "@CAPS41, this is @PERSON3, @CAPS12 is there"? "@CAPS43 One second (@CAPS44!) (Phone!) "@CAPS40"?
The time when I showed patience was when I had to slide down the water slide. It all started with me at @LOCATION1. I want to go swimming at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. The place is so big you can fit @NUM1 people. My patience is when I go up the stairs to the slides and everyone rushes in front of me just to go down the @NUM2 slides. So I waited about @NUM3 minutes to play the fun slideshow. It took me so long to blason because you have to go up @NUM2 flights or stairs??? So the second time I went up the stairs, I ran up the stairs so I could be the first so I did , but I still had to wait because it's still the same person last time. So I waited for my turn. That's when I showed my patience.
While I was patiently waiting I was in line at Gender Point at @CAPS1, we were late at Cedar Point so we got to the end of the line and there was a sign to pass that said "your wait will be @NUM1 hours so we Standing in line for an hour finally got to the front and as I walked up the stairs I was so excited I realised I only waited an hour and @NUM2 mins to get to ?? this and then I ride it??? was? ??
My patient time is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I arrive @CAPS3 @NUM1 hours early. @CAPS7 We walked to the front desk because we thought we were running late, so we walked to the front desk out of breath and @ORGANIZATION2 said "Are you okay!" I said "@CAPS4, am I late for my foyce appointment"! Wo you @NUM1 hours early "she said" @CAPS2 you pulled me. @CAPS1 @NUM1 hours ahead of your favorite two hours at school"! I said "Excuse me, do you want me to take you back to school? "@CAPS6 I'm fine". I said @CAPS7 we're waiting in the lobby and then I'm fine because I have ???west as game @ORGANIZATION1 ball @CAPS8 not chichi @NUM4 for @CAPS9.S! I Just played until I got sick of it and then I read some wired adult magazines. Simple, I was only @NUM5 when this happened, now I'm almost @NUM6. Then @CAPS3 came out and I got the @CAPS1 gun. That's the longest time I've been patient
@DATE1 I was in the store with my sister and my mom one day and people were huddling, bumping into each other and yelling "get out of the way". It pissed me off and everyone else, but like everyone else, I didn't yell at the overworked people. It's almost Christmas and I can see why everyone is so pissed off. We all try to just mind being our own bussnie. But for some people, the dust drives everyone else crazy, so this is where patience comes in. After all, we went out and went home. This is why you should be patient.
One day my brother and I went hunting in @CAPS1 Oaks. It's about a mile and a half walk. When we were ready, the hunt began. We waited, but we didn't see anything, but we wouldn't give up. So an hour later, we saw a flock of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers start to lose their color. As they approached, the male's beard swung from side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minutes, they probably caught our send and ran away. After that we knew the deer wouldn't come out but we were wrong, we saw a deer about @NUM2 minutes later. We kept watching it until it reached the shooting range. I was looking elsewhere and I told my brothers they were the deer around us. So he looked and he saw that there was only one deer. So we watched them get closer, like a storm getting closer. So my brother took back his bow. He pulled the bow back for over @NUM3 minutes and he almost looked like a statue. My brother waited for it to turn because his head was facing the other side, in the perfect field of view he was shooting. Arrows shoot out like bullets in guns. The arrow missed him, it was about NUM4 feet from the deer. The deer heard the arrow and ran away. We waited hoping for other deer to come, but we didn't see it, so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. We hauled everything back to the car. When we got home, everyone was waiting at the door. But we told them we didn't get it. So my brother and I had dinner and then my family sat down to watch a movie.
Sometimes patience can really help your life, it's the only thing that keeps us sane. Patience is important. It's like my dog has run away and I'm waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you get stuck waiting for someone, but there is always only one option, wait or be patient.
I like to light up houses or puzzles. Because doing the puzzle takes time, it takes hard work and patients to complete the house. If you don't have a patient, it's harder to do when you get the board for it.
My dad is a very patient person. He is known to be very patient. This is an example of his camera. He waited all @NUM1 years to get a shot. Because he is patient. My mother is very patient. My mother is also very patient. She waited a whole month for a pair of slippers because she was very patient. I am proud of such patient parents. That means I know they're very responsible and that's what I think of as patience.
When my brother, my father and my two cousins got off the bus @NUM1 hour drive from @LOCATION1, we knew it was going to be fun. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller @CAPS1 galore. I saw the amusement park at Cedar Point. In the car, we talked about @CAPS1. Maverick, Millennium Power, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and mentis. As soon as I walked in, I knew the road was going to be fun. Just as we walked in, we saw @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go later. Over time, we pretty much used @CAPS1. As we approached @CAPS4 we saw at least @NUM3 people lined up so we had a chance to continue the highest ride. When we got to @CAPS2, the line was bigger than when the day started. We discussed and decided it wouldn't get smaller and moved on. About later a @NUM4 year guy was with his mom. He had a cool fish on the back of his shirt, so my cousin asked him what it was. He said it was @LOCATION3's tropical fish. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got in the car. Great ride and worth the wait. This is how I wait patiently for good things to happen.
One time I was at peace was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS1 + cousin. I had to get my cousin @CAPS2 to sit down as they were getting back to @LOCATION2 while my cousin cleaned up the room. My cousin is sometimes in the minority, and always as he wishes. But I was calm and waited until the trip was over. I didn't complain until I got home until my mom. My cousin and I had a lot of fights that holiday. But I still love him. I have to be very patient with my cousin to even do what he wants, but I know his mom is very proud of me. I remember when we went to the pond to look for alligators. But then @CAPS2 wanted to go package. I knew I had to give in (considering he's @NUM1 and immature). But I just went with the flow and we just went with the flow. That's when I have to keep my cool.
Not everyone has a patient. In order for someone to be patient, you have to understand and tolerate what can be very difficult. I am one of those people. A patient is a gift. There are patients who need time and you can't always be in a hurry. For example, once I heard someone talking in my basement. So I went there to see who was in my house, @CAPS1 I was walking and I heard giggles and excitement I kept walking until I heard something from behind the door. I went to open it and I saw all kinds of gifts and I saw two people, my mom and my dad. They hurriedly closed the door and told me to go up the stairs. So I ran up the stairs and told my brothers what I saw. They were all excited and everything. Day 2 is over and I can't wait for day 2 @CAPS2. so i waited
@PERSON1 wants a dog. She really did. She's been asking her @CAPS1 for a while. Every time she asks her @CAPS1 she replies "You can't have a dog until you earn it." @PERSON1 doesn't know how @CAPS7 earns it, she thinks for a while she really doesn't know her @ What does CAPS1 mean, she thinks her @CAPS1 means she needs @CAPS7 @CAPS8 some of her responsibilities. She looks at the clock that says @NUM1, it's almost time for dinner, she thinks her @CAPS1 might be working on it, so she walks out of @CAPS7's kitchen, her @CAPS1 is making dinner. @PERSON1 loudly asked "what's for dinner?" Steak and mashed potatoes. That's @PERSON1's favorite. She nodded and said "No way!" "Why not?" her @CAPS1 questioned. @PERSON1 asked what she could do and her @CAPS1 said @CAPS7 put salt and pepper @CAPS7 on cooking steak. Her @CAPS1 is delighted that @PERSON1 is willing to help @CAPS7. @PERSON1 did what she could and went upstairs to @CAPS7 her room, she wants her @CAPS1 to get the message. She had dinner with her @CAPS1 and then she went to bed at @CAPS7. The next day she ran down the stairs @CAPS7 to find her @CAPS1 sitting on the coach. She hurriedly said, "What are we going to do today?" Her @CAPS1 replied, "I was thinking we could hang out around the house." @PERSON1 is getting impatient, she wants a dog, she's trying her @CAPS6 @CAPS7 Well done, finally she held on, yelling "Are we gonna have dogs?" She said "umm..." @PERSON1 surprised @CAPS1 interrupted "@CAPS1 I @ CAPS2 @CAPS3 one and me @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 you! "If you're more patient, her @CAPS1 answer is great, I'd say maybe we can go see anne" @PERSON1 on veiled Feeling sad and realizing that things would have been better if she cried later that day, she went out with her @CAPS1 for the day.
When I was patient it was my sister who dropped my phone into the Kool-Aid. I plan to buy a new one, but it depends on my behavior. That means I have to be extra good and patient. I was fine every day for the rest of the week. I still didn't get the new phone, so I asked my sister when to buy it. Well, since it was her child, she proposed to buy me a new one. She told me it was coming and I had to be patient. After another week, I started to get impatient, but I didn't. The next day my sister took me to the metro pcs store to pick up a new phone. Be patient, I finally got a new phone, and that's when I'm patient.
I have to be patient when I go to @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient, especially when it's all sold out. For example, when I was waiting in line for a shirt, the line was really long, so I had to be patient. It took a lot of patience as @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and they only had three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At @ORGANIZATION1 we have to have a lot of patience like parking to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 minute break, I went to hit a pop and all the lines were long. I queued for about @NUM2 minutes for my pop and my cousin's fries and my sister's pop. I finally got everything and forgot my pops but luckily she gave me a new one just in case it wasn't my @CAPS1. I went back to drink my soda and watch the show. Everything needs a patient, and while you wait, you get everything you need. This is when I have to be patient.
Patience is like a jungle cat looking for prey. It must remain completely still to become prey. It also has to be patient. Then pat once it's in the Wright position. Cats achieve their goals through patience .
During my dance audition, I had to be patient. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 Grove Academy, I audition to help pay for my program. I'm ready to go dancing, there are about @NUM1 people in the dance studio. When I left the audition, I worked really hard. My teacher told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship I got. Every day I wait in the mailbox, hoping my letter will come. It's been a month and I still haven't gotten anything. I'm starting to worry, I don't think I'll get anything. One day, when I gave up all hope, a letter was sent to me saying that I had only received @MONEY3. I'm very frustrated because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 doesn't help much. I want to give up dancing, but it's a talent I want to keep doing. So I waited until the dance started and my teacher told me there was a mistake and I actually got a scholarship from @MONEY2. My mom is happy and so am I. My teacher apologized for the confusion and for taking so long. I learned a skill that year, patience can pay off, but don't give up because it will be fine in the end. I also learned that it takes patience to learn from an early age, because when I grow up, a lot of things will hold me back and I have to have patience so that I can overcome all of them.
I went to the doctor once. The doctor said to wait in this room with my siblings and mom. She said another doctor would come in. We waited in that room for three hours. My mom was so angry they forgot about us. The doctor who was going to come in went into the wrong room. The worst part was that I had to shoot three shots, and I hated shooting. In summary. I learned my mom wasn't that patient and I got ice cream after the doctor, so patience always pays off.
Another @NUM1 minutes wasted! I know I should be here sooner! Urg! So many people, so little time! Have you ever had to wait for @CAPS1 to eat? Three days ago, although I should have stopped by my locker before heading to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey-coated locker shut and ran to the cafeteria. I sped past a large group of seventh graders urging to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patties, "What's up?" I thought. I @CAPS7 reached my destination and @CAPS6 food is there! I reach out - waiting for food from @CAPS6? The food tray is @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza seduced my senses and made my poor little belly growl! I paced angrily, "@CAPS6 is food?" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on sub bread. I jump to another line. I gripped my tongs in disappointment and put the fries and cheese on a plate. At least I have some food! I plopped and sat down at my table when another lunch lady came up to me and gave me a soft, soft, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience. "I got a cookie! Warm, delicious, @CAPS11" I thought. Sometimes it's irritating to wait, but sometimes you @MONTH1 will be rewarded!
I was patient when I had to wait in the waiting room for my foot to break. I waited about an hour and a half. It's really boring with everyone walking in front of us. Sometimes my mom was so impatient, I just sat in the chair for an hour and a half. At the end the nurse said "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in which took about 20 minutes. The doctor just wanted to know how I broke my foot. So we had to wait for the nurse to come back and cast the cast. It also took a long time because first they had to put five layers of cloth on it, and then two layers of the casting thing, and then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be difficult at times, but everyone can have patients.
One day long ago, not @CAPS1, my brother @PERSON1, had homework troubles. Yes @CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home every night to do his homework. Mainly math. One day, he needs help. I said "about what". @CAPS1 He said "@CAPS2 The math homework is too long, I can't do it." @CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade and the homework is only fifteen questions! I say just do your homework. About two minutes later, it was the whine that I needed help again. @CAPS1 I helped him. It takes a lot of patience and I was very patient because it took him an hour. I checked on his work when he had a fight with my mom. Oh, and @PERSON1 also took a shower. It turns out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers are right. As I waited patiently for him to finish the shower, I took a separate piece of paper, copied the questions, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 got out of the shower, I hid the answer sheet. He got pissed when I told him he only got two right. Although I helped him with my patience skills. In student-led conferences, I saw him get an A. What a happy ending for a patient-filled essay.
Patience is many things. Use patience every day. You can wait for a check, you can wait for a letter. Sometimes patients can be very fast or very slow. @CAPS2 can be used at school or even at work. Things that can happen to you if you wait patiently to stand. For the test, you can wait patiently for the answer to the question by waiting longer for the answer than being quick and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1's experiments @CAPS2 can also be used in math to find answers. When you build a model, you have to use patients, so @CAPS2 is true, without patients @CAPS2 would be false. That's what patients mean to me, everyone must use @CAPS2, @CAPS2 is part of your everyday life.
Patience is a very important value. To get away you need patience. When I got my first horse, I had used my patience. I need to be patient with her because she is stubborn, self-centered, and well-trained. I had to teach her moves at a slow pace so she could remember what she was supposed to do. I also need to be patient with her because she just moved into her current home and doesn't know her surroundings. Still, these are just some of the ways patience has come into my life
Sixty-nine days ago @CAPS1 - Three miners in Chile were trapped underground. They were trapped half a mile off the ground. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is are they still alive today? The answer is patience. what are you asking? Patience is one or more people who are understanding and forgiving. When miners get into trouble, they don't panic or blame each other, but wait until someone can help them. Then @DATE2, after they were found, miners were told they would be leaving the hole around @DATE3. Even though it's been four months since @DATE3, not a single miner complained or shouted. They all understand how hard it is to escape. Thank goodness all miners came out safely on @DATE1. It all takes patience to exercise. @NUM1 and a half hours restored all @CAPS1 - three miners.
On the way to @CAPS1 point! I screamed in my head. too crazy! Just disappeared from Lake Erie. I saw! It's within walking distance. Oh my gosh, we parked in the parking lot, all the way to the stamp station, we got the stamps, went to the medal column, we stopped, and the security said "no". We found out that it only opened at ten so we waited and waited and more and more people came and soon it became very crowded and more people came, me and my cousins @ PERSON1 and @CAPS2 are both going to play stage titles and we're already in line. Finally @NUM1 time into the park, we all huddled in front of the fence and dashed out of ourselves there, we went to queue for the @NUM2 minute rapter. Man, but hey, it's so worth it. Yes, patience helps "a lot"
It's @DATE1, @NUM1 my brother's birthday. He turned to @NUM2 and he pissed me off because he kept asking my mom for things and he kept saying no, she didn't. Then he would ask my brother like you know I got this money for my kids. So he would keep asking people and it made me nervous because when someone said they didn't have it, they didn't have it. I didn't say anything, I was quiet because it was his birthday, but I knew to be patient when it came to important or special things. So I just looked at him, looked at him, and I said here you can take my money it's your birthday so you go. So I gave him what he was angry and asked for and he got what I was patient with because I didn't leave him because it was his birthday and it gave him what he wanted.
When you have patience. On the day I was patient, I had an Asma seizure. I am very scared. Worst of all, my inhayler broke. this is not good. So my mom passed on @CAPS2 to the doctors. The doctor gave @CAPS2 a ventilator, and I was fine: @CAPS1 gave @CAPS2 a perscriptnion and said "everytime you feel like you can't breathe again, I'll do it." I said "OK" @CAPS2, my mom went to @ORGANIZATION1 and put it down and we said we'd be back in an hour. I went home and fell asleep and my mom woke up @CAPS2 and said use had to go and pick it up. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and they said "please wait" "okay" my mom said. We sat in the car for an hour, waiting, waiting, waiting. I am grateful that my two sisters cried because they wanted to go home. My mom didn't pay that day (that's not good) so she was pissed. The worker ended up saying "@CAPS3 you're sorry for this item" my mom paid for the font and we left. I enjoyed it that day.
When I have the patience it's me and my family going to West Villania. And we have to get up early to be on the road show, we don't have to be stuck in traffic. The show was on, and when we got it, they had a nice house. But we had to queue to get into the restaurant. They @NUM1 just to get us in. We had a pleasant dinner. That's when I'm patient.
What is patience? Patience is the act of understanding, tolerating, and going through hardships without complaining. I'm going to tell you a little story that every parent has to go through and it takes a lot of patience. My little brother @PERSON1 was born on @DATE1. My mother has been dreading the day of potty training since birth and she knew she was coming soon. As you @DATE1 know, diapers and pull-ups have gotten pretty expensive, so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years old, they started potty training. Potty training requires a lot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 doesn't go to the potty while @DATE1 continues on her own. My mom knows this, but she's still pissed when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on herself. At other times, Mom became very patient because she knew he knew it all, and he was a little kid. My mom is still trying to be patient, but she knows @PERSON1 will be getting old soon enough to go to the toilet or go to the toilet on her own without having to wear pull-ups. Patience can bring many good things.
My dad operated on him two years ago because he broke it at work. I had to sit in a very uncomfortable wooden chair for almost ten hours in the waiting room, doing nothing. Every two hours my mom, grandma, grandpa and I would walk up to the car and stretch. After about four hours, I was really tired but didn't fall asleep. That was the longest time I ever sat in one place in my life. At first it was hard to believe it was nine and a half hours, it seemed like there were only two.
I'm patient with a lot of things, and I'm patient when I play. I was patient when I was tested. I'm very patient with almost everything. Many people are also very patient. Some people have no patience at all. As impatient as some of my friends are playing football there. They just want to get the ball and score. Once I was playing football with my friend in the park and my friend asked me to pass the ball. He had no patience that day.
Patience is the key to tolerating troubles and problems, and it can help you not make tragic mistakes. Do you even need to be patient? ? ? A challenge in your life. Being impatient, nothing stops you from rushing into trouble with an unfocused state of mind. If you try to deal with something without being patient enough, you are likely to make major mistakes and/or reduce your chances of success and achieving your goals. Patience does come in handy during sports brawls, disasters, and many other situations. In sports, it can be helpful to be patient when you are waiting for playing time, when your team is falling behind, and when your teammates are not doing the right job and responsibilities on the team. In general, being patient will most likely help your team to execute smoothly, and sharing your opinions respectfully. Ultimately, this will help you resolve issues more smoothly. During a disaster like a house fire or tornado damage, patience allows you to sort out everything that's lost and to think clearly about what I've just experienced a house fire so I know patience is about dealing with and getting through this A good way for the situation. In general, I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you're patient, you're going to get stuck without complaining. Now, you @MONTH1 don't think this applies to you, but I can honestly assure you that life isn't always "roses", so sooner or later, you need to be patient. Waiting carefully for things to happen is usually not a person nature, but it is indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the importance of patience so that we can live a better life, and I'm certainly not implying that we need to learn this trait quickly, no, we just need to be patient.
We lined up for speed racers at Cedar Point one day. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I lost my patient so my dad told me to go get a drink and go back to the same place. I was standing and I was told that security took us back to the end of the line. We are crazy and my father is losing his patients. We waited for hours and finally it was our turn. We waited so long and the drive was about a few minutes. We said we would never return to that journey. That's when I lost a patient.
I was a patient of my little brother at that time! I was baby sitting and they wouldn't listen to me or my other sister, I just relaxed and sat on the floor and played with them and it all went well after that.
Do you ever feel like your @CAPS1 is going to explode? Have you ever wanted to say something but didn't want to say it because what you said would make things worse? Well, that's how I feel in this story! My little brother and my sister are so mad at me, I really want to explode. The story starts at @TIME1pm, my brother @LOCATION2 just got off work and has been complaining that he is tired of walking home alone, so I plan to walk home with him to surprise him, I just graduated from high school, I hear me My name was called so I looked around and I heard my name called again so I stopped, my sister @PERSON2, my friend @LOCATION1 came from behind me and stopped @PERSON2 said : "I don't want you to walk yourself to @LOCATION2" so we kept walking, Savannah and I kept switching, the scooter got slower and slower as there were two people riding we stopped and pressed Pressed the power reset button and started walking again, then we called @LOCATION2 to say we didn't see him, already @NUM1, he said he was at his friend's house and my mom was coming to pick him up. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died and we kept holding down the power rest button and nothing happened so I ran home to get the bike and there was a sweet stream on my face and ?? nonstop as soon as I got to the house My legs are numb, my legs are the most slumped I get up and put on my shorts, grab my bike and run out the door @PERSON2 and savanah is already asking me at the party store @LOCATION1 and asking "@CAPS2 took you so long ?” I told her what happened when @PERSON2 pushed @PERSON1 and Savannah on the handlebars. In my @CAPS1 I was thinking how long it took me to get there and now I'm crazy. Am I here they come, how do I think I'm going to die because of the scooter, we put the bike and scooter away, walk through the door and fall off. The lesson learned is not to do something unless you foresee it happening. I learned this the hard way and I will never do it again.
When my family went to makiew we had to wait to get on the boat. We were patient as we had to wait to get on the boat. We had to wait at least @NUM1 minutes for the boat. He's not starting to be a mean @NUM1 year old @CAPS1, he's just waiting in line. When we got there, we cycled around the island. We did what he wanted to do. While we did, I was patient. @CAPS1 I thought the trip was ok because everyone was so patient.
I'll have to be patient for a while as my sister will have her sweet @NUM1 on @DATE1. So it was hard for me to be patient because my mom and my sister planned so much at once. It's hard for me to relax when they're out shopping for a party, and most importantly, we're taking a trip to @LOCATION1 before her birthday. So we have a lot of plans to do in half a month. It was very difficult and she had to be patient. see my mom? ? ?? Plan a party and still be able? ? Went to @LOCATION1 with my family. In this life, have I lived? ? Be patient, but it? ? ?? ?? ?? try to be patient? ? ?? ?/?? ?? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?
My story about patience is when my sister was in the doctor's office. It's been a long day. At first we went in and it took her an hour to get in. She finally got in and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I would see people coming in and going out. I see about @NUM1 people doing this. I sit and read the magazine, why am I waiting for her to finally come out. While she was still around, the day was almost over. It was a very patient day.
I wanted it so badly when @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 came out the other day, so I asked my mom and she said @CAPS2 maby, guess what @CAPS2 will come up with. That was @DATE1 and I couldn't wait so I went to school and got through every day and I got there and said "I'm sure I'm going to get @ORGANIZATION1 like my mom" and that's when handreth I said to her, She said: "You have to be patient or I may never get it for you because you have a little brother by your side and if he hears you say I want this he will think @LOCATION1 is not real so Please be patient. Well, for the past few days, I started to be patient and I had to be patient for a while because only @DATE2 came and I went to school, of course it's stupid and a waste of time, but I don't care, Since I'm about to get @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 I just have to deal with it and be patient at the same time. Well I know one thing I'm lucky because I haven't asked for @CAPS3 the past few days I'm so patient I can't really believe it I really never have patience unless now I'm getting something awesome. So now I only have @NUM1 days antil @CAPS5 so I'm really quit. So I'm off @CAPS5 on the last @NUM1 days of @CAPS5, So I play video games to save patient time, then my last @NUM3 days playing outside, so it's not a waste of time. Then at @CAPS5 and the only @NUM3 days I just played outside Intel are over, the last two days I even played outside with my friends on the eve of @CAPS5. Then the day finally came to @CAPS5 and I finally saw my presents and my mom said you open them and you'll see them once I open all my presents , I just didn't see @CAPS3, my mom gave me a gift she was holding, then @CAPS3, and finally I got it, so now I don't have to wait any longer, over
@NUM1 @CAPS1 A former kid named @CAPS2 had a problem. This question is something he wants to keep to himself. He felt this question was about to end him. His problem is that he has to go to the dentist! ! ! @CAPS2 Hate them getting in your teeth. He also hates the smell of the dentist's office. @CAPS2 is leaving in three days and he is even more scared because this time he is leaving alone. Then he realized he couldn't be such a baby, so he longed for patience. He easily waited two whole days, and then the day came. He wakes up, drives his bike to the dentist, and then he waits a short time before having to go back to the room and have the dentist examine you. He longed to close his eyes and wait patiently. When it was over, he went home and the patient was there.
Do you know anyone who was and is still patient? Everyone has been and probably has been patient. Some people learn how to have good patience by learning from their elders or some kind of role model. Patience can be a big pain at times! Even if you are in a bad mood, you must know how to maintain a good attitude. It's a good thing to have patience because you're sure to be fine with kids of all ages. Get along well with moody people. Patience must also work with listening or respect. You may have a child who can't hear very well, so you have to have some patience with that so they can listen. If someone doesn't have great respect for people, it takes patience to work with them so they can be treated with great respect! In conclusion, patience is a way element of life.
I remember being lucky if the steakhouse and the lady said we had to wait half an hour to be seated. I thought I was going to die, but my mom said be patient. About twenty meters left, I was about to shoot, but I sat in my chair and waited, not saying a word. But I waited until excienley and then I went crazy. Ten minutes left and I'm about to explode I want to eat but I can't but I still haven't done anything and said nothing? ? ? Got the bathroom. @NUM1 left, I'm calming down and still haven't said or done anything as I prepare to eat. This? ? ? Could happily eat and cum and then we could wear gloves and then the food came out and that was the most patient of my life.
Patientce is hard, like when you walk into @CAPS1's office, you have to wait patiently for your turn to see @CAPS1. Patience is just another word for "wait", you have to wait to see @CAPS1. But most people say you can't wait patiently to see @CAPS1. But instead, most people say you can't "@CAPS2 wait and see @CAPS1. Patience is hard for some. Many can't wait to see @CAPS1. Another example is "@CAPS3" being a family On a road trip you're here @CAPS3 saying mom when we get there, that's my weakness, that's a sign of impatient. What would I say if someone came up to me and said what was patience?" I'd say "Wait a minute" Wait for your turn, ? ? ? For dos, wait for @CAPS1, then wait for us to get there.
When I have the patience is when I go to the doctor. _When I went to the doctor for a checkup, my appointment was @ TIME1 and we didn't get a call until @NUM1. I had to wait a long time! Finally, when we entered the doctor's room, the nurse took my blood pressure and then I had to wait another @NUM2 minutes to see the real doctor. By the time the doctor actually came, it was about @NUM3. I got my flue gun and the pig's flue gun. @NUM4 I'm ready to go home when I'm all done. That's when I'm patient.
Some people are completely patient. Some people have no patience at all. Except me; I'm kind of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patience, a few things come to my mind. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she's not that patient. I think of my mom as she tries to be patient. But I mostly think about myself. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try to be patient. If it's @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or @CAPS2, I'll try to be patient. When it's my birthday, I try to be patient. I also try to be patient when we're going to a special place or I'm doing my homework! It's like @PERCENT1 opportunity, I'll be patient. I think the main reason I can't always be patient is that I get irritated very quickly. I think I just lost my cool a little bit. Even though I lose my cool easily, I can still be patient sometimes, and when I cook, I can be patient, even if I'm super hungry and the food takes too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is in your nature. Like to sing or dance. But for others, it doesn't show up at all. In general, I think patience is something everyone should have. If you have no patience at all, it means you have no patience in school. You won't be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don't get me wrong, I know it can be hard to be patient at times. Adults and children/teens are also not always patient. I think we should always be as patient as possible!
Patience is no fun, butts are sometimes necessary. I'm going to tell you how patience is not fun. It's a quiet day at school. I'm waiting for the well to ring. My friend @CAPS1 is finally going to answer my question. The question is do you love me? I can't stop thinking. ring! ring! ring! Finally I can see that @CAPS1 is as excited as I am and I storm out of Doyle. I went to his locker and he gave me a note so I looked. It incidentally says maybe I like you. I am very happy. Patience is no fun, but my question was answered. Next time you have to wait patiently, good things will come to those who wait.
At some point, you have to be patient. Please be patient if you are in line. You have to wait patiently for the sharing part. If something comes up in the middle, you have to be patient, you can wait for what it is, or you don't know what it is, you just can't run and get it. When you go to the store and you see something you want and ask mom or dad to say they'll buy something for your brithbay, then you can't wait for your Bathbay, and then you can't wait for your birthday. Well, I've been there. I love crismase because you get pretty much everything you want; when you do something you've always wanted to do, you're there for the first time. You have to be patient with all these things.
This is the story of a boy who becomes a prince and a girl who needs a prince. Of course, this is a story about love. Usually those. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1 and while I'm empty inside, I'm gone. There was gore for a while. My mother died when I was six years old. In the ten years since, my @CAPS2 has been wasted. He was always there, sitting in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry at night at @CAPS7. He's useless now, but I'm very patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 parks, doing odd jobs to earn extra cash, and running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know it's not just @CAPS2 I'm waiting for, I love me too. I need someone. I've been pushing the idea away, but the truth is, I spend all my time waiting. Waiting is rewarding, visual. One day in the park, a boy came up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name is @CAPS3. He told me he had seen me here before and asked why I was studying here instead of at home. That day was the first day of my prince @CAPS3. I'm not just @CAPS1 anymore, I'm @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3, he reassured me three weeks after I met him. He hasn't been around since @CAPS7 I cried at night, right there on my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in the same park. I am also very patient with him now. This is the story of a boy who is a prince and a girl who is waiting for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, just like when my mother died. Hear @CAPS2 cry. Quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I'm still waiting for hello.
Patience is your understanding and tolerance, and I have always been patient. When I go fishing, I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Don't complain, don't say anything because people around me catch a lot of fish. I feel like a fool, but I'll just sit there and watch other people catch more fish than I do. It's still the same with age. I want to shoot myself every time someone catches another fish. I hate every time someone catches a fish, but I'm patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I was nine, I went to a party at a friend's house. He lives by a lake. Everyone but my family brought great joy and feeling. I had nothing to do, so I asked a boy if he could borrow his rod and fish while he was eating. He said yes, so I walked over to the lake and threw the line away. I saw something big tail coming out of the water. Suddenly, a giant tag on the line nearly threw me into the water. Roll up the wires one by one so they don't break. Finally, I triumphantly held the fish high above my head, shining like the sun. My patience over the years has finally paid off.
The four sisters line up at Cedar Point for their second most exciting ride of the day. Right after @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The roller coaster roar and rider screams were amplified by @CAPS14 and it started to stop again. "I'm super excited soon!" @CAPS4 Youngest sister? ? ? . "I know I will," the others said almost simultaneously. Eight hard eyes moved at the same time, staring at the same thing. @CAPS5! This serious package deal involves twists and turns, wind and rain, tribulations and hills. "@CAPS6". @CAPS10 how long has it been? ! "???@PERSON3."@CAPS7 hours. " @CAPS8's eldest, ???, has her curly long black hair in a ponytail. "@CAPS9 little grasshopper" said @PERSON4 has calves??? Confronted, "@CAPS10 this son is really cool Like me" @CAPS11! Agree with @PERSON1 with a displeased look on her face. "@CAPS12 mine? ? ? Guys look! Coming to the front line! ' exclaimed the second oldest @PERSON2. "@CAPS13 Me!" " Say a voice came from??? Abuse." @CAPS14 You're patient, but we've had some difficulties with the ride and we'll fix it as soon as we run. thanks. " I really hope @CAPS15 gets it done ASAP!" ' said @PERSON3. '@CAPS15 agreed. @CAPS15 waited about half an hour @CAPS7 @CAPS14 Another announcement came. "@CAPS16 Thanks again for your patience, but this question will take another @NUM1 hours solve. Thank you for choosing Cedar Point. " Then the sound is off, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, go ride the grant swing.
It was the day at the @LOCATION1 center, I went to the parade with my football team after school, the line was slow, and eventually we were done and my best friend @PERSON1 left the house. Well, he got me ready and I went to his house for a while and then we left to get something to eat. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1 there were about @NUM1 cars and they were all in the driveway and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But luckily because the game doesn't start until @NUM2, and it's @NUM3. So we sat there patiently, ordered food, and left to watch the football game. That's when I have patience.
Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 now and not later. You have to stay calm and be patient, they almost forgot what they were doing, but I'm always @CAPS1 now too. I can't stand to have nothing. If tested on @DATE1. I would be unhappy if the test was changed to @DATE2. I just can't make it that long and it makes me nervous just knowing what to expect. If you're patient, it's almost as much a gift as singing and dancing.
"Where is it?" the woman asked a third time. "@CAPS1 lobby, to the left of the bathroom," I said for the 50th time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom and she said nothing. My dad works for a small company that makes gift shop-like gadgets like snow globes and stuff. @CAPS4 offered me a job @DATE1 after my sixth grade to help him work. Little did I know what @CAPS4 meant by going to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway of a huge building and telling people where his showroom is. When working in manufacturing and trading, you don't usually meet the brightest and most educated people. If you want to go anywhere, you really need patience. "@CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour," I muttered as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag with Young's blue and white company logo on it. "@CAPS3, you're with young people?" @CAPS4 asked. "Do you know where the showroom is?" I can tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why do teens work for co-ops? "@CAPS1 lobby, to the left of the bathroom," I said in a robotic voice. "@CAPS6 are you too young to do this kind of work?" @CAPS4 asked. Are you looking for an intern? I hurriedly thought about it, and instead replied triumphantly: "@CAPS8, sir." "@CAPS9 Are you old?" @CAPS4 asked suspiciously. "@CAPS11, sir." I lied. I know I can pass high school, so I know @CAPS4 will believe me. I really hope @CAPS4 keeps going because I'm getting very edgy. I've started imagining what would happen if I grabbed his tie and pulled it as hard as I could. Doing this all day is @CAPS12 healthy. "Are you paid?" @CAPS12 Enough to put up with someone like you. I think. I took a deep breath and replied, "Yes sir. But it's @CAPS12 a lot. It's more like volunteer work, really." @CAPS13 Don't ask any more questions, I think. @CAPS4 smiled and walked on, "Thank you son." "You're welcome," I said through gritted teeth. I think we can all agree that I was patient that day. I hope that guy bought a bunch of stuff from my dad's store because I'd be pissed if @CAPS4 didn't. That's when I'm most patient.
Patience When one has patience, one can wait a thousand years for an answer. Or when you are stuck, he/she is understanding the problem. I've always considered them saints when they have the patience to handle wives, kids, and work at the same time, and keep their cool. This is amazing. Patience is when you need help, this person is always theirs and he will be there for you patience. I think patience is calm, doesn't lose your temper, and will help you when you need a little patience
I always have patience when I put together model airplanes. Sometimes I had to ask my dad for help when putting together more difficult models. Like @CAPS1-@DATE1 on the @NUM1 bomber. I also had to be patient when looking for rabbits, squirrels, deer and turkeys. If I'm impatient, I might miss a good shot or a good animal. I sometimes have to wait patiently with @CAPS2 and other students at school.
I'm patient when I really want to go to my favorite store. @CAPS1 I wake up and tell dad I want to go to my favorite store. @CAPS1 My dad said "let's go". @CAPS1 We went to the store and it said it was closed. @CAPS1 I checked the time and they will open in @NUM1 minutes. @CAPS1 My dad and I are both sick. Well, mostly my dad because he didn't say "let's go" or anything like that. @CAPS1 @NUM2 minutes have passed and we have @NUM3 minutes to wait. Finally @NUM3 minutes passed and time was up, but the guys working there said to wait @NUM3 minutes because they had to set it up. @CAPS1 My dad is always nice. He waited another @NUM3 minutes, @CAPS1 we can go in. Now it's finally @NUM3 minutes and we're in and I'm so happy @CAPS1. Patience is the best thing. No complaints or nothing.
In the middle of @DATE1, it was a nice sunny day outside. It's hot outside, like the Sahara desert. "Honey, put on your swimsuit and shorts and get in the car," my mom yelled out the window. "@CAPS1 Mom," I asked. "It's great," she replied. So I did what she told me and wondered where @CAPS9 was going. When @CAPS9 got there, I knew exactly where @CAPS9 was. @STATE1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with a big smile on my face. "@CAPS3 to continue @CAPS4 @CAPS5, want to come," I asked my mom. "@CAPS6, her answer sounded funny." I looked when @CAPS9 reached this heart-pounding roller coaster, the line all the way to the end of the sidewalk. "@CAPS7, I don't want to wait for mom, the line is too long," I complained. "@CAPS8 patients, dear @CAPS9 will be on a roller coaster soon @CAPS8," she replied. An hour later..."Mom, forever." I whimpered. "@CAPS9 is next in line," she replied, still smiling. So when the gate opened, I was so excited and nervous I couldn't believe I waited an hour to get in the car. "You're very patient," my mother said, straightening her hair. "@CAPS6 I am, @CAPS3 proud of it," I said to myself.
One of the most patient times I've ever had was in downtown @LOCATION1, one of the best @CAPS1 places around @CAPS1 poupules! @CAPS2 was very hungry as my dad and friends waited at our table. It's been @NUM1 minutes since @CAPS2 ordering, but I've been patient, like I'm crazy and hungry, I'm tireless with my food. Finally it came and I am very satisfied.
To be honest, I really don't have much patience. I get mad at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. usually. I get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out and get in the car. Sometimes we go dancing, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it was, though, I'd freak out if we were late. Even if I'm going to a small event like a birthday party, I hate being late because then everyone is usually there and I feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone makes random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really drains my patience. I also can't stand it when someone starts poking at me for no reason, it really pisses me off. Another thing that makes me very impatient is that when I'm in trouble, my parents are teaching me things I already know and I just hope they've done it. Sometimes, because of not cleaning my room, my mom would lecture me about things she'd told me a million times and I just wanted to scream "stop talking." Other times, it'll be because I haven't removed my plate from my room, bathroom, or connected to the kitchen. It's just a repeat speech, I already know everything they say, so I don't have much patience for it. I can get impatient at times, but I still have some in my heart so it won't wear them if you're on my side.
I'm writing a story about my patient time. On my birthday @DATE1, I was at my dad's house. My dad asked me if I wanted to celebrate my birthday. I didn't know it at first, but it came to my mind. I told him I wanted to go to the paint shop to shoot. He said yes. But before we go, he says can you cut the grass for me? I said yes. So it took me about @NUM1 hours @NUM2 minutes to mow the grass so I told him I was done and he said ok so I took a shower because I smelled like wet grass. When I got out of the shower I called my friends and cousins to see if they would come and they said sure. So I asked my dad when we were going to pitch. He told me it would be a different day. So I called all my friends and cousins and told them not today. They have no opinion. My dad said we were going before the @DATE2 star and we already went. To this day, I remain patient.
There are many times @CAPS1 one's life is when someone is patient. Patient @CAPS1 is a very important trait that can bring its own rewards. I'm a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of dance. @CAPS1 Every dance class has a wide age range. Sometimes we have some difficulty learning something as difficult as a transition jump or something as easy as Pierrot. Every @CAPS1 in the @CAPS1 class was very patient when these events happened. @MONTH1 It takes fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a foothold, but the other dancers are still sitting and waiting patiently. Patience also develops when training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they will have difficulty learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 shows impatience, it doesn't help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or gently correcting her/him, @CAPS1 is a sign of control and patience? Ultimately, by spending all your time teaching him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because of your patience! As you can see, patience brings joy and comfort to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respects. Like I said, patience @CAPS1 is a very important lesson and we should never forget it.
@PERSON1 is waiting patiently during class. I was in ping's class closet and she would clap a third time until they stopped talking or were quiet. Will she continue teaching when they're quiet? ? ? @PERSON1 is talking and we should be patient until she comes down to speak to us. That's the patience of @PERSON1.
patient. At one point I had to be very patient at @CAPS1 barrymores as we queued up to go karts and yexi had to be at least @NUM1 or older to participate. I also had to be patient for my birthday this year because I knew I was getting something cool, but I never thought it would be this cool.
I remember one time @CAPS3 sister used to keep talking about @CAPS4 cream sundaes and more. @CAPS3 Mom had to drive me all day because @CAPS3 Dad was sick, which meant "@CAPS4 Cream Girl" had to show up too! @CAPS3 Mom knows @CAPS6 has been around for a long time. @CAPS5 is in the car, @CAPS5 drives past @ORGANIZATION1 when @CAPS3 little sister loudly decides "I'm hungry and I want @CAPS1!!!". That's what @CAPS6 calls five minutes of continuous shouting. That's when @CAPS3 mom yelled "You talk about @CAPS4 cream you are @CAPS2 get it!" @CAPS3 girl's face expression @CAPS6 is about to cry, even worse! ! ! @CAPS3 mom gave her a cookie so @CAPS6 will be content for a while; when @CAPS5 hears a song on the radio, @CAPS5 starts driving home, @CAPS3 sister likes to add "@CAPS3" to every song CAPS4 cream", so @CAPS6 started squirming with his tongue. @CAPS6 All afternoon. @CAPS6 didn't speak all day! So @CAPS5 drove past @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS6 started crying. @CAPS6 Enough is enough. "I want @CAPS4 cream!!" @CAPS5 was messing with her, so @CAPS5 went back to @ORGANIZATION1 and gave her her "@CAPS4 cream" that @CAPS6 wanted most. @CAPS6 was patient all day, @CAPS6 knows it's hard work. @CAPS3 Miss Sister learned a very important lesson that day, that is, "Patience means good things will come.
Once I was patient than when I went to get my teeth cleaned? ? ? I went to the doctor. I waited three (@NUM1) hours to get my teeth cleaned and it was my hands so I pulled out a book to read instead of the @ that I was called to get my teeth cleaned while I was reading the book NUM2 ½ times, after that I went to the doctor to get the wald and the medisan refilled the shoes. I had to wait about two (@NUM3) hours before being called into the room, but I waited @NUM4 so they could have the footage ready. So I waited about 5 hours and 5 minutes and after all this time I finally went to @ORGANIZATION1 for lunch. That's all I did that day.
Loyalty is when an individual stands by and supports something. I think everyone should be loyal to you? ? ? Because it means you believe and you have reason to focus and have a purpose. Loyalty to me means showing perseverance by not holding back. I know a man who was always loyal and held to his beliefs. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 will have a fight with everyone. My brother is loyal to "Aliens". I say that because he thinks aliens are? ? ? And don't care what other people have to say. I've tried to convince him millions of times that no aliens exist. But he kept saying "@CAPS1 is alien proof." @CAPS2 My brother never lied to anyone and will always stand by you. If someone says it's not true, he'll defend you. He said, "It's not cool when someone talks about another person, it means that person has insu??? My brother never let anyone talk about me without answering. The last thing my brother is loyal to Himself. He never tried to be someone he wasn't. He said, "I try to be someone I'm not, not me. I'm a street smart nerd, I mean I'm still watering the carbon. " In short, my brother is a loyal man because he sticks to everything he believes in. Even aliens??? or himself.
This is my story about patience and my closing hope is to "write a story about you being patient too". My method is that I wait @NUM1 hours at the doctor's office to put a brace on my wrist friend. First set up in the waiting room, then the office, had to wait @NUM1 hours. So my dad and I were in this waiting room where it was supposed to be. @NUM3 made an appointment, she seated us, and @NUM4 others. So I said my mom he would go find him. Iany seems to be the first @CAPS1 and has been waiting because I'll be very patient. But my dad wanted him to worry and catch up on sleep. A lot of people do when people go to help call a lost patient. They and @CAPS1 hours ago, @CAPS1 me? Say my life, but that should be my baby my mom. Since having the "or ion", I've jumped off my dad, woke my dad up, and went to my mom. These guys walked for an hour, but I was patient. So the adder came in and gave me the bracket, then relocated and left. That's a story about him patiently waiting @NUM5 minutes in the doctor's office.
It's good to be patient because you respect that your problem takes time, but when you're impatient, you want to get over it now or soon. I remember when my brother @CAPS1 was impatient. My brother @PERSON1 and I are waiting for a new video game to come out, but it will come out in @NUM1 days. So he waited a day, checked the date, @NUM2. Then another day of waiting @NUM3. He wasted @NUM4 days of waiting while I was focusing on school. His grades dropped to @CAPS2+ and now he blames @CAPS3! So I just told him @NUM5succsess. He works harder @CAPS4 - he spends his time on grades and the game he wants is @NUM6 and he's happier now because he patiently uses his time wisely while staying busy.
This is the story of my patience. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. When my favorite song plays, I reach out to change the program. But I was stunned when I heard the guy say that it was going to be sold, and the tickets were sold in town. I told my mom she rushed into the car and got there so quickly you couldn't even see us leave. When I got to the line, it was so long it seemed to go on forever. I waited and waited and it felt like it only moved an inch. Tee waited, still waiting for me to start getting mad, but I was in line. My long wait was over and I started to jump for joy. When I walked to the concert venue she said: "Sorry, we're all sold out. I couldn't believe it, I started screaming. I've done all this and waited for nothing, it's so unfair. That It's time for me to be patient.
Be patient: @PERSON1 I started riding horses a few years ago. I really like it. I ordered new riding boots about @NUM1 months ago. This is when I absolutely need patience. My mom and I went to bet line tack.corn and ordered my new boots. When they arrived, they were too small, so we sent them back. Days passed while I waited for my boots. They didn't come. I had to be patient. After another day, my mom finally called them. They said when you re-ship, I would go through fourteen days of processing. My mom and I both had to be patient. Weeks passed and still no boots. My mom got a new credit card that week. Another week passed and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card it said declined. But @CAPS1 problem solved, I'm glad I had the patience to wait for the boots, and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 rides comfortably in my new riding boots.
One time I waited patiently for my mom to pick me up from school at @TIME1. School was out at @NUM1 so I had to wait outside for almost an hour and a half. It was winter, so it was about @NUM2 degrees Fahrenheit. It was also windy, so I used my instrument case to shield my face from the wind and snow. But it didn't help much because I couldn't feel my face, I saw a clock in school and I found out I'm only here @NUM3 minutes! The wind and snow were horrible, I was counting the teachers and the number of people who left the school, I was so bored. My face is as red as a cherry. So I started reading to pass the time, but my fingers were starting to get cold and I was dreaming about all the hot things in the world. First hot chocolate, then @DATE1, then @DATE1 Florida in the heat. But I try to be as patient as possible, and it's hard. I'm cold as ice, I dug into my bag for something warm, and I found some gloves to match with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves on so my fingers didn't freeze. Then I saw a red car that looked like my mom's car and then it passed a wave of sadness and it swept over me and I couldn't take it anymore! But when I got up, a car stopped, it was my mom, I put my stuff in the car, turned the heat on high, and my mom said thank you for your patience.
Have a little patience. Do you have the patience or know someone who is "doing a good job", that's exactly what I'm going to talk about in my own way. Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very fond of what she wanted. There was something about her that no one knew. She is patient. Everyone always felt hurt for her, there was something special about her. She was out with her family one day and she couldn't wait, but you know what patience she has. She also wants to go shopping at the @LOCATION1 store. Unlike other children who can't wait to always bother her parents, she just sits patiently. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2 too. She can't wait to leave, but you know what got her, wait patiently in the store to get the calm she wants. When they entered the store, she finally got what she wanted, which was just five pairs of jeans and a shirt to go with it. She was about to leave, then her parents started looking around, but when they got home, she was patient, she was so tired, she didn't go back to her room to sleep. They have lived patiently ever since. I made this story to say we have to be patient, that's how chance and problems happen, this little girl got everything she wanted and she was patient.
I'm at Delight Airport. It was around @NUM1 and the sky was bright and gloomy, but no rain, just a warm breeze blowing across my face. My mom, brother and @CAPS1 walked through the tall metal doors and saw everything from the gift shop to our destiny, where we'll be @NUM2. We got our tickets and got on the plane. We went through the metal detector and had nothing but my leather stripes on the pink and brown straps. I slid it back and started walking. As we got into the plane, we passed a lot of people I didn't know. I'm sitting on the window seat, my mom, bro, I'm sitting in the flesh-colored blue chair waiting in excitement and fear to fly into the sun
Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact, I had to be very patient at one point because my little cousin who lives in @LOCATION1 was pissed off from birth. She takes longer to get things done because she @MONTH1 is her own little darling, but that's not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with wheels but she tried and she still knows how she got better today but still has brain issues. So I scaled her from terrible to better to excellent. Over the years, her condition has improved, which requires patience as she suffers from the disease. So you really don't yell at her because she's very emotional and sensitive, so you have to be quiet, kind and patient. So she will always have issues, but you can be patient and she will @CAPS1.
I went to the orthodontist yesterday to wait for my exam. @CAPS1 took a while, but it's my turn @CAPS1. When I got home, I felt like I was starving. I wait for dinner to be ready, but even though @CAPS1 is only an hour away from @CAPS1 being ready, @CAPS1 seems like @CAPS1 is the time of a lifetime. The smell of cooked food wafting from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat quietly reading until @CAPS1 finished. After I was watching Ghost Hunter, my little brothers came in and started cleaning up the mess they made with toys. So I had to pause the show because they couldn't do anything when @CAPS2 was on. So patiently, I waited NUM1 minutes until they were done. So overall, I think I was very patient yesterday.
This is when I have the patience to go to the doctor. I had to go to the doctor two days later. My mom told me I needed three shots and I never like them because they hurt and make you sleepy. I usually never have a patient, but this time I did. I have another day and then I will go to the doctor. I've experienced why people should be patient, and it's easy to do. Today is my doctor's appointment and I'm terrified. I always feel nauseous and tired when I walk into the clinic. My mom would go and sign my name and I would get sicker because I would worry about how many shots I was going to have. My doctor called me and I was scared and my mom always told me it wouldn't hurt if you didn't look at it. So I went back to the doctor's office and my doctor told me to get on the scales and I was literally the one who gave me the hearing test and the vision test. I asked if I had to get any footage he said he didn't have yet, but I might have to. When I finished the hearing test, I was done and I was afraid of anything. When I got home, I learned two lessons, one is not to worry about anything, and the other is that I learned how to take care of the sick. This is when I have the patience to go to the doctor.
This @DATE1 me, @CAPS1 mom, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, went to @ORGANIZATION1' concert, @CAPS1 mom wasn't so excited, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was so excited just seeing '@PERSON1', I was so excited just to Going to @CAPS4, we entered the parking lot '@ORGANIZATION2 MUSIC @CAPS5' @CAPS6 There was a long queue at the gate, taking up half of the parking lot! But we had to wait an hour on that line to get in. when we got into our seats. It started to rain, of course at an outdoor concert. So by the time the opening show was done, I was soaking wet. Then people started setting the stage for "@ORGANIZATION1". We waited another hour and a half for them to get set up. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 moms are outraged, I've been waiting and staying positive. On the plus side, it was a great concert, @CAPS7 glad I had that experience, but next time @CAPS7 will put on a hat!
I was patient when it was my siblings and I who were told we were going to @LOCATION1; it was important to us. Of course my siblings and I were fighting over something stupid in the kitchen and suddenly our parents called us out. @CAPS1 great". I thought. When I was thinking about what kind of punishment we were going to get, my mom broke my mind and told us we were going on vacation. "@CAPS2 punishment," I asked. "What "My mom replied. "@CAPS3," I told her. We were going on vacation at @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2. But we had to wait a whole week. Every day my little brother would ask "When are we going to travel?" " Every day my mom says soaring words." In a week, in four days, in three days, in a few days, in two days. " @CAPS4 Today is the day we go on vacation and my parents are so proud of how patient I was waiting to go to @LOCATION3 for a week. That's when I was very patient.
When I was patient was in my father's office. We were there for an hour. Please be patient before we leave. It's not easy to be patient. I had to spend a whole hour without saying anything. Until my dad told me too.
My dad can be very patient sometimes. when he's not angry.
When I had the patience was actually a few days ago. My mom and I were in line at the @ORGANIZATION1 store so we could return a broken box. This is the third time we have had to return these boxes. I had to wait in line for half an hour and saw only angry customers. Still @CAPS1 it's not our turn to line up. The man standing on the counter wasn't impatient at all, in fact he slammed the door as he left, muttering a few words. Finally @CAPS1 it was our turn, my mom was very patient with the worker, (even though she didn't want to be) the worker didn't know what was wrong with the box, so she gave her a new one and we left. Patience can lead to good things, like this line I always love @CAPS1 saying "he who waits gets good things" @CAPS1 is very true so keep that in mind! be patient.
Thompson volleyball player aka @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lost our game. We continue @DATE1 at @CAPS3 restaurant. You know @PERSON1. She asked for some chopsticks and @CAPS1 made us wait @NUM1 minutes for chopsticks. So @CAPS4 asked a volleyball player and she gave everyone some except the adults! We have fun. I asked for some napkins, but we didn't get them. I really did it at the waiter, but I had so much fun and so did the other Aris!
An important skill you need in life is patience. With my new anhydrite on my arm, I can't do much. I am a very active kid playing football, basketball, cross country and soccer. However, with my broken arm, I had to be patient with my movements. Patience paid off and my arm healed faster but not more. Then I started exercising after my coat was cut. Patience can be beneficial, as long as you wait long enough.
I am waiting for my grandpa to come home. He went to a pagan sale and found a coop for my chickens. I am helping my grandma. I am Marlin. I'm excited for him. go home. Then I went out. I am working to pass the time. I cleaned the barn first. Then I do @CAPS1 cows, I feed them away, then I feed them, then I clean the coop. Then I made chicken @CAPS1. I have collected eggs. I feed them and water them. Then I had a lot of fun, I worked on volleyball. Then I practiced hitting and pitching softball. Then I started shooting. Then I teased the crocodile for a while. Then I took @CAPS2. When I came back, I thought what I could do. And then I see? ? ? Mountain. I know I will draw some???. So I came out machete and went to live @CAPS3 whipping. I load the track to . Then when I came back and took the other tractor out and hooked up the header to do it, I went out to work and when I came back I was thinking what am I @CAPS4 to know when I heard the same and pulled it It was my grandpa when it came out. We followed the track to town.
Once, when I had patience, I was playing a football game with my friends and the other team was frustrating us. But even though we lost, I kept my cool and we beat them in the end, @NUM1
Patience is a hard but good thing because patience can help you make progress in life, such as getting a job. One way you have to be patient when looking for a job is to be the boss? ? ? Your repeating the same mistakes disrupted his sweet time. You don't want to get impatient and yell at him and tell him to hurry up because that will get you the job. So all in all, patience is a great skill because it helps us make progress in life.
Be patient, Lucy said to @CAPS1. I will finish it soon. How fast is how long? kinda. I'll finish filing in about an hour and then I'll take you to the park in an hour? for such a long time. Just go watch TV. But I don't want to leave me alone, or I won't take you to the park when I'm done. So when does @CAPS1 play video games with his little sister @PERSON1 for a while, make some pizza, and then his school friends come over and ask him and his sister if they want to go to the park with him and his mom. So he asks Lucy Is it possible to go to the park with Ryan, she said yes, be back before five. He had a great time with @PERSON1. And ryans mom bought them ice cream. He learned that patience is very, very important.
I've been to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 before, my family and I went about a year ago. They have so many rides! We were amazed how many were theirs. My family and I decided to go to the small rides first. We did things like "@CAPS2 Traps", "@CAPS3 Stars". There are also many water rides. At the end of the day, my family and I line up for their biggest ride. It's called "@CAPS4 Timber". The track is made of wood, which is what scares most of the ride. They are prolly @NUM1 people. I told my mom I didn't want to wait too long. She said "you need patience" and I said ok! It was a ride and it was a lot of fun. After we got out of the car I said "Mom, patience really paid off".
When I got my bow, I was very, very, very excited. Well, I'm excited because my sister @PERSON1 has bowed in front of me and I don't think it's fair. I had to wait @NUM1 all year until I got my bow at @CAPS1 time. Well, my mom and dad hid it in my bedroom closet and I never noticed it before. That's when I had to wait patiently when I had to wait to get my bow. Now I shoot outside almost every day. Thanks for listening and reading.
Let me get one thing straight...I'm impatient. I mean, I can sometimes, but. Mostly I am not. If it was my birthday @CAPS1 I wouldn't stop taking it or thinking about it. Impatient, I just said I can't wait. Most of the time... @CAPS1 I can wait when we're going to a boring family.
Melting @CAPS1 One day @CAPS13 sister and I just woke up to a bright @DATE1 @TIME1. @CAPS5 is at the door of @CAPS13. Light passes through the @CAPS13 carriage and @CAPS13 lid. @CAPS5 pushed the door open a crack and said: "@CAPS2" "@CAPS3" I got up and moaned "@CAPS4 I'm up. I'm sleeping." @CAPS5 picked me up and hugged me as I searched, I went into the living room. @CAPS5 got what I think is a paper hen in the kitchen, but @CAPS19 is aluminum. Dazed, I turned on the TV when I didn't know @CAPS13 Mom was on the coach. "@CAPS6, go get the diver dressed", shout? ? "@CAPS7.K." I??, "(@CAPS8 wants to go downstairs." "@CAPS9" he shouted. "@CAPS10' I'm thinking in @CAPS13's head. We're going downstairs to ??? Laundry. Put clothes in the dryer, I take a deep breath and say, "Did you smell it?" @CAPS5 looked scared and said, "@CAPS9 I'm cooking." @CAPS13 widened her eyes, I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I turned on @CAPS19 and @CAPS14 pushed me out of the bunny communicator. "@CAPS10 Air!" We joined. We went back inside and climbed through the kitchen. We stopped Down and staring at the fire; we were still asleep on the couch running towards @CAPS17. We rocked her, rocked her, but @CAPS5 didn't wake up so I said "cover your ears. !" "@CAPS16 you guys are wrong!" @CAPS17 "@CAPS1, it's on fire, @CAPS18 @CAPS19!" I screamed. @CAPS5 got up, we ran, @CAPS5 grabbed a glass of water and poured @CAPS19 on @CAPS1 on. "I'm going to teach you how to cook better or until you don't set anything on f angry!" I said.
There are @NUM1 different languages in the world and they are different? ? ? Among these languages, there are more than @NUM2 different languages in total. But in every language, the patient means the same, understanding and tolerance. Everyone has to be patient at some point, let me tell you? ? ? Once I was patient. About a week ago, I got into an argument with my best friend in the world. Later that day, I realized we were all. I emailed her, texted her, and called her phone and home at least @NUM3 times @CAPS1 with no answer or reply. The more @CAPS1 ignored me, the more frustrated I got, and then I talked to my cousin about it. "You have to be patient with her, this is your first fight." @CAPS1 told me in a calm voice. So, I waited on the phone to see if @CAPS1 responded without using the swear words, and I left her alone at school. Finally, one day @CAPS1 spoke to me. @CAPS1 said: "I'm sorry too, thank you for your patience with me. I missed hanging out with you, how about we sit in the band together?" "I'd love to live like that." Reenactment, after five days of fighting Finally reconciled. Through experience, I have learned that patience pays off. So it's your turn @NUM3 to speak up and understand why people say what they say and what they mean. Patience is always the most important thing.
When I'm patient is I'm going to clean my house and my mom says I want me to do that? ? ? when she came back. So I straighten up and clean the bed, clean the bathroom, take the dog outside, clean the crow, do the dishes, take out the trash, and do the laundry. After doing a lot of things, I'll watch @CAPS1 play games or wait on the computer all day, and once she gets her, she doesn't When was it brought she said I forgot so we're going to get pizza.
The time when I have the patience is in the doctor's office. I'm waiting for my doctor to come out. But it took him a long time to come out, am I? ? ? To be patient, Andy then the doctor came out and I started to feel better.
One day, my friend @PERSON1 and I were at @ORGANIZATION2 and we were waiting in line for @ORGANIZATION1. We ran to the front of the line and waited about half an hour to get on the bus. But luckily me and @PERSON1 are patient. After the ride, we lined up for @CAPS1! Wow! How awesome, I think we queued for at least an hour and a half before getting on the bus. But you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient. @CAPS2!
One day my dad needed his keys and I had them. Some of his keys were in my room, so I checked. Twenty minutes passed and I still couldn't find them, but my father was still patient: I searched the room for his keys, and they weren't on my dresser, closet, bed, or my floor. I just had them unlock the car and now the keys are gone and then when I went to tell my dad he waited patiently for an hour and I put them in my pocket.
Once the kids had an Apani time named @CAPS1 and he had no patience at all. Another kid named @PERSON1 and he's very patient. They walk in the woods and get lost @CAPS1 won't stop complaining. @PERSON1 told him to stop complaining @CAPS3 @CAPS1 until he said a house that was hunted @CAPS1 told @PERSON2 wanted to go in with him. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 didn't want to go in, so @CAPS1 went in and pretended to be hurt, so @PERSON1 ran in, dorslamd closed, doorknob didn't feel right. They are afraid of the dark. Then the light came on. @CAPS1 said let's get out of here! @PERSON1 said how the door handle fell off. @CAPS1 said I didn't know they ran away, the house there had no other doors and windows, but were scared, and then a ghost attacked them, he said glad @CAPS7, dad built them a house there and said all You had to push the door open. They all went home. Finish
patience. If you're like me, it's almost impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours. But sometimes I am patient. Like I'm waiting for the @CAPS1 party, I can handle it. But this story is different. It's been a warm day, even though @DATE1 is coming to an end. I don't care though because I'm focused on one thing - my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I've waited @NUM2 days until I get a ton of gifts in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was a while before the party started. I played some sweet video games. Playing outside, just squatting and sitting until @NUM3. I can't believe it's only twelve years old. To me it just seems like a few hours have passed. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We had some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, and when I got home I was like @CAPS2 rushing to my clock in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I don't know. It's a full hour until my party! The last hour of @MONTH1 seems like a whole year to me, but I'm still alive, right? My friends don't know I have patience, and neither do I. Believe me. I will never be so patient again. once.
When I was pashit, I was doing my math @CAPS1. I figured it out @DATE1 my ant did exactly @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 quit at that time, but this time I'm pashit, @CAPS4 and I @CAPS5 it.
This is a story about my patience. The time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my food at the grocery store. I ordered my food and they paid Aldi to give it to me. I waited patiently. Who are the others? ? ? exist? ? ? There? ? ? They still didn't give me mine so I went out and told my grandpa they were going to give me my food. I told him because he kept asking me why they were taking so long. So I went back to the grocery store and asked them why it was taking so long and they said it would be there soon. Then I sat down at the food store and I looked, so my friends walked into the food store. So we started talking and patiently waiting for the food. Their names are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @PERSON1. My name is @CAPS3, I was born on @DATE1 and I grew up in @LOCATION1 oit. I was patient because I wasn't angry and I waited. Then they called my name and said my food was ready. Then I got my food and told my friends I was going home and I left. That was a story about my patience.
One day I was looking at a catalogue in a store and saw a goalkeeper jersey that I wanted so badly. So I went to my mom and showed her what I wanted. She said it was a bit expensive, but she would buy it. The next week is long, waiting for shirts. On @DATE1, here it comes, amber, red, blue and purple. I finally have a goalkeeper jersey that I can wear and make great saves.
The time I was patient was when I was waiting for Dad to come home. After get off work, I can bake the package I received before he left the state for a three-day trip, so when he comes back, I goat it open.
It's my @NUM1 birthday when I have to be patient. Why because I was waiting for my call, mom cep told me to get it on the first day of @DATE1. But I still don't believe her, I guess my final gift is my brand new phone and a case I call a pacet.
"Are you there yet?" I said, walking back and forth. "Be patient, it will take a while to get out of the locker all the way from here," @CAPS1 said, "@CAPS2! @CAPS6 is on camera!" "@CAPS3 caught him!" @PERSON1 said: "@CAPS4 is here Behind us." "@CAPS5 funny guys! You guys better give me my clothes back or I swear I'll be in front of the camera @CAPS6!" @CAPS7 yelled as @CAPS4 tried to grab his clothes called...but missed. "@CAPS8! I'm running out of patience @CAPS7!" I said another photo "@CAPS10 I think @CAPS3 should put it on the internet." I continued "@CAPS11! You can @CAPS5 take it Put it online!" "So you're going to stop attacking us?" I asked "@CAPS8!" @CAPS4 said: "@CAPS13, then I'll zoom in here." "@CAPS13!" @CAPS4 when the towel fell scream. So to show @CAPS3 a little respect for him, @CAPS3 gave him his clothes, turned and walked away.
I wriggled in the air, wrapping my arms around me, face up. I felt a throbbing pain @CAPS1 I staggered through my feat, "What just happened?" I thought to myself, and I started to feel the sharp pain in my forearm again. I'm biting my lip @CAPS1 hard @CAPS1 I can choke all the tears and pour out like a waterfall. My friends started asking me. If I'm okay @CAPS1 soon @CAPS1 I'm starting to hold my arm. "I think I might have broken it" I replied during a break from work as they scrambled for help @CAPS1. After calling my parents to remind them of what just happened, I quickly found myself in the ward. I sat there waiting for hours, waiting for my parents to pick me up to take me to the Children's Hospital for a checkup. Both were at work and couldn't come to pick me up @CAPS1, moaned that day as I became more and more anxious. Finally the bell rang, finally @NUM1. "Bang!" The door opened and it was my dad, not my mom behind him. @NUM1 is when they got off work and my parents told me they were glad it was just a broken arm and they rushed me to @LOCATION1 right away. That was the experience I had to endure. It turned out that my arm was broken. There are many situations in life where you have to be patient and all you can do is end your life @CAPS1 and it will come at you.
Jenny and @PERSON3 are twin siblings and host a carnival every year near their home with games, rides and food. One day @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 politely asked their mom @PERSON2 for some money to ride the Ferris wheel mom, "Can we each have a dollar to go on the Ferris wheel?" @CAPS1 @PERSON1, "of course" @CAPS1 Mom handed them two dollars. Excited, @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 ran onto the Ferris wheel. They waited another hour and it was finally their turn, during which time the person in charge of the Ferris wheel watched @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 wait in line. When @PERSON1 is about to join the cast, it means the boys shove them to the ground and sit down. Now mom taught them how to be nice to everyone and they remembered so they got up and let them go. When it was their turn again, the person in charge of the ferris wheel noticed what had just happened and told them he was proud of @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 that they would go around the ferris wheel three more times for their patients. After the ride, they thanked the man and happily ran home to tell mom what happened, mom was so proud of them, and hugged @PERSON1 and @PERSON1.
I am very patient when hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far, you have to get the deer into a nice clearing, not behind the bushes. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer is near and you have your bow ready, your mind will make you think like you. It will get close, then go as slowly as possible, you just have to follow it. When all the patience is over and you're ready to shoot and you get it, then it really pays off.
The time when I was patient was in @NUM1 grade. It was after my birthday and I wanted pink @ORGANIZATION1 shoes. My dad at @LOCATION1 said he'd get them, but he'd have to buy them, deliver them to grandma, and have my grandma send them to me, and I'll get them sometime after my birthday. So one day he called and told me he sent them and I should get them within a week. So I waited patiently for my shoes, a week later. They are not at my house. I don't want to buy my dad and call him every day so I just wait patiently. After @NUM2+ weeks I was starting to get worried and angry so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said my grandma will bring my shoes in an hour. So I waited patiently for an hour and my shoes hadn't arrived yet. At this point, I just decided they would come when they came, and I just waited. Finally, I got the shoes the next day and I was so excited. I thank my dad and I put my shoes on the next day and I know my patience has paid off.
@CAPS4 I'm patient, I'm impatient sometimes. But no matter how impatient I am, my @CAPS5 is even more impatient waiting in a big traffic jam. Angered by the long delay, he sighed and became very impatient. He'll say, @CAPS1 is on, @CAPS2" "@CAPS1 is on! " @CAPS4 was horrible with @CAPS5 in a traffic jam or long queue. But after the long queue. @CAPS5 being myself again, such a relief about my past!"
I was patient one time when I got into a fight with my little dick in @LOCATION1 and he kicked my jaw and I assured him I wouldn't tell him even if I kicked my jaw a second time. I fell to the ground in front of the others and I was swarmed like a swarm of bees around a hive full of honey. That's when I'm patient.
One time my big brother told me we were going on a micigman adventure so i waited till he got home then my dad told me i should be ready to go so like backing up my shorts and ? ?? ? ? ? So I did that and I just sat there approx? ? ? Then I called him and he said? ? ? ? ? ? A generation
@CAPS12 is the ninth winning @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 full count, @CAPS5 loaded, two outs. @CAPS2 swung and hit his first major as the pitcher threw the @NUM1 fastball to center. The crowd exploded, @CAPS7 as we were about to leave The anoncer said don't forget gear today, only on the field today @CAPS8 is singing". I begged and begged my dad to stay, @CAPS9 @CAPS14 agreed. @CAPS10 I'm there Time there is a long line. As time ticks slowly @CAPS 10 minutes seams like hours. I can see the kids getting ansi. I had to @CAPS11 my dad didn't say" The only way we're running is @CAPS11, you matter". @CAPS12 took a long time, all you have to do is look around and you'll see kids going crazy, little kids crying. I can say I Possibly one of the last five to be patient, even my dad was frustrated @CAPS12 took at least two hours and @CAPS13 hours to get to the front, but @CAPS12 feels like @NUM2 days. I @CAPS14 got the whole trolley I'm very happy with the autograph. I even supriezd the day I didn't know I had @CAPS12 to be that patient for two and @CAPS13 hours. On the way home my dad stopped at @CAPS15 and let me Cool, @CAPS9 said @CAPS12 is for patience and not so bad @MONTH1 will be more patient from now on, @CAPS16."
One day my mom, my sister and I were going to the hair salon to get our hair done. There are so many people talking there. It's also a bit noisy. The TV was on, the radio was on, and a group of people were talking. When we got there my mom signed the three of us on the sign in form and we had to sit and wait. We waited a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day, but my mom said we had to wait. I'm hungry, I'm sleepy. We waited an hour. I didn't let it bother me, so I turned on my @NUM1 player and listened to it until our next time. Then we had to wait another hour and I got hungrier but I didn't say anything. So we waited and waited and finally we got on the next one. We all have our hair done. Then when we left, we went to buy some food because we were all hungry. That's when I had patience at the hair salon.
Once upon a time there was a bid called Jack. Jack and a little brother named @PERSON1 are @NUM1 and Jack is @NUM2. @CAPS1 because Jack is a lot older than @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 is his brother @CAPS2 has to watch him a lot. Jack has a lot of patients because @CAPS2 has to see him every night because his parents work late. But @CAPS2 still thinks his brother is annoying. But seeing his parents know that if they pay him while @CAPS2 he'll keep looking at him, so @CAPS2 does just that. But one day Jake's brother @PERSON1 won't stop complaining because @CAPS2 didn't get his way and Jake finally got mad and said if you don't stop @CAPS3 I won't be watching you again, yes today will Walk half care. " @CAPS1 @PERSON1 loves daycare, so @CAPS2 stopped immediately. @CAPS2 was so pissed at his brother because @CAPS2 was never like that with him. So @CAPS2 wanted to say @CAPS2 sorry, @CAPS2 did it, His brother gasped for him. "I'm sorry I made you angry. " @CAPS2 said. "@CAPS3 is ok," his brother said. "@CAPS4 try not to let @CAPS3 happen again" @CAPS2 said. Then the next day Jack and his brother hang out after school and everything is fine Goes well. "I'm glad we didn't get mad at each other because I didn't want to go to daycare," @PERSON1 told his brother. "Yeah, I don't want you to go because then I'll have nothing to do," @CAPS2 Say. @CAPS5
For a while I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We drove to @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a lot of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited @NUM1 on the bridge! It was a more real night. We are hungry. We really have no compliments. But we were there for a long time and around @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we're deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to continue @CAPS1. We looked at the line and it was a @NUM3 hour wait. We are in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1 and my brother @PERSON1 are together a lot. This is another nightmare come true. So my dad and I have a good line with @CAPS2. In fact, it didn't take as long as I thought. After waiting, we got on the roller coaster. We laughed and scared at the same time. The roller coaster is over. I am very sad. But the three hour wait was worth it. Later that day we rode @CAPS3, the first stand-up coaster ever built, and again I was terrified of waiting @NUM4 hours. @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 died of waiting. But the waiting time only felt like an hour. I'm terrified of that roller coaster. But I like it. It's fun to ride a roller coaster. After a while we left. It's been a long day. Finish.
In this story, I'm watching the video game @CAPS1 @CAPS2 appear at @CAPS3 @NUM1 time. This game will be the last game of comcay bunsie. I already have it, he's here. I'm fine but I don't understand why your mom's character stays on a plant called @CAPS2 and is the only address book there and the whole vanished character is coughed up by @NUM2 aliens with swords Rush up The first time I went to buy at @NUM3 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 the parking lot was packed with probably all the @NUM4 year olds living in their mom's basement. So we waited about @NUM5 weeks to get it. We bought it and then we got more, this wasn't a week of @PERSON1 games that fights gave it, so got it done in two minutes, so don't wait any longer.
When I was in 5th grade, I wasn't doing very well in math, so my @CAPS1 agreed to help me study for the upcoming exam. So on @DATE1, I got up early but my mom came home late from get off work and she was the one who drove me there. So my @CAPS1 is very understanding and patient. So my mom drove me home and we were an hour and a half late, but my @CAPS1 was still very patient. So we started helping me and I was totally lost I didn't understand what she was talking about, but she still tried and was very understanding. I got almost every question she asked me wrong and she still tried her best to help me understand it. She had to help me for about @NUM1 hours, but she stayed the course and really helped me, I actually got an A on that quiz, all because of her help and patience with me. I know it must be difficult to work with me for a long time without losing her patience with me, I really respect that and I am so grateful to know someone like that.
The times I have patience are @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2. I was sitting for the meap test when my stomach started to hurt. For about @NUM3 minutes, I was sitting there walking around. Then I raised my hand and asked to call my mom. When I called and I asked her, @CAPS3 said "@CAPS1.S @PERSON1 can you take it??? Go to the office." @PERSON1 said ok. Then I went to the office with @PERSON1 and I called the phone at home and my sister picked up the phone I said to her "@CAPS2 I'm talking to mom." @CAPS3 said "wait. Then my mom said" Can. " I said mom can you come and pick me up, my stomach hurts so bad." @CAPS3 said "ok" and hung up I waited about @NUM3 mins sitting on the patient, tossing and turning in my stomach hurt so bad . Then finally call agian "I said mom you're here" @CAPS3 said "@CAPS4 is on my way". I said "yes" and hung up. I sat there patiently and miserably until finally my mom walked in the gate of the school and signed me and @CAPS3 said "come on" my sister and ??? were sitting in the truck waiting to go Family Health Center. I sit in the front seat. I was sleeping on the way home and then when we got there I woke up and I went into the house and lay on the couch and fell asleep.
My mom is a patient person. Once when I was very young, I had chewing gum in my hair. I cried a lot and walked around as my mom patiently tried to get the gum out of my hair. She kept telling me not to move, but she never got mad at me, even though she really wanted to stop and let me figure it out on my own. I screamed when she couldn't get it out and said she had to go in. Tet, be patient, she's kind of able to cut out the gum and make my hair look beautiful even when I'm not sitting still. I think my mom is the most patient person I know because she is so patient whenever something happens.
When I'm patient is when I fill the cavity at the dentist. When we got there they said my date wasn't for another? ? ? But my mother didn't want to leave. I am like this? ? ? TV on? ? ? . Is it my turn finally? hours to prepare. What is the learning experience? ? ? Learn to be patient when someone spends a long time doing nothing
beep! beep! beep! My alarm goes off and it's @NUM1 and I've missed the bus! I hurriedly got up from the bed and quickly got dressed. Hope my siblings are waiting for me downstairs. Oh no! They are not downstairs! Running back down the stairs like the house was on fire, I went into my brother's room and yelled, "@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS4 has missed the bus. I don't want to go straight to my sister's room. Shouting the same thing, she Quickly get out of bed, get dressed, walk downstairs, thinking that everything will be alright. I get my breakfast ready. Then my sisters run down. She grabs her food and yells, "@CAPS1! "@CAPS3 it's time. It's @NUM2 am only @NUM3 minutes so I start breakfast. My bro hasn't come down yet. After breakfast, I go back up the stairs and wake up my @CAPS7 and my bro .They came downstairs behind me. My brother just took jelly time for breakfast: @CAPS4 now @CAPS4 is going to be late. @CAPS3 back the clock is @NUM4 only @NUM5 mins! "@CAPS4 won't make it" I said . Finally everyone wants to be in the van, @CAPS7 driving. Going to school. My sister and I yelled: "@CAPS1! Shop! "@CAPS7 ignored my brother and didn't care if @CAPS4 was late. In the end @CAPS4 was only @NUM6 minutes late. I'm gone, my brother is the only patient in the family.
There is a kid named @PERSON2 who is always patient. He always waits for other people, he never complains. When @PERSON2 woke up that morning, so did his five siblings. They are all trying to be ready for school in under an hour. All bathrooms are occupied, but @PERSON2 didn't complain that he actually used that time to clean the room and make the bed. @PERSON2 a bit late for school. @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 said come here, the whole class said ooooo! ! ! what! what! @PERSON2 is in trouble. @PERSON1 said come here, @PERSON2 walks with head down like he's pulling a ton. @PERSON2 was last in line at lunch. No more food once @PERSON2 is there. The lady at lunch saw how sad he was and made him a special lunch. When @PERSON2 got home, his family threw a Patience Party. It's an honor and a pleasure for @PERSON2. The best night for @PERSON2
Patience, as my father always told me, is one of those who succeed in life. As I matured, I increasingly realized that the patient was important. I remember one time I had to show patients for a long time. I went to Cedar Point with my family and my friends. My friends and I can only think of the biggest ride in the park, mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. "The @CAPS1 ride gave me the most frenetic, heartbreaking, adrenaline rush. But it's going to take me a while to get on it. So we go and go and I'm starting to get tired. After @NUM1 After an hour walk we arrived at mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. I was disappointed to find it was a @NUM1:30 hour wait. The sun was burning. I think the best way for @CAPS1 is to be quiet and relaxed. Seems like you're complaining The more it takes, the longer it takes. Before we know it, we're about to get in the car!
"@CAPS1 hours and 30 minutes, are you kidding me!" I said as my father, I joined the "maverick" bandwagon at @CAPS2 point. "That's what the sign says, but it might take longer," my dad replied. I said in a disappointed tone "I guess we can wait" but I reminded myself in my head that you have zero, zipo, no impatient! Why do I say yes. When my idea was done, the line moved up a bit. I think this is fast. During that time, I've been watching people on @CAPS3 and other rides go by as the lines move again. The team moved up again. It was useless to watch people this time, so I was wondering how much fun the Maverick ride would be and what other rides I would like to continue next. These thoughts lasted halfway through. My patience is running out. I started thinking about how close the school was to me, how much I wanted to go back, how much I didn't want to go back, what I would miss and what to expect. We're almost there, but I'm losing patience every second. I started to tap the side of my leg with my fingers. I didn't think of anything, just tapped my finger and moved it up. We were finally on the front and I didn't complain once! I got into my seat and the ride started. In the end I felt I was really worth it. Now is the time for more riding instead of complaining. That's when I'm patient
I was patient one time when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball games. It's like @NUM1 hour drive throws @LOCATION2 and this is how we go, I'm in the back seat of the car and my ears hurt so my ears are so excited I have to wait @NUM1 hours. Another reason my brother @PERSON1 tried to grab my foot and then took his stuffed toy and hit me with it. I would tell him to stop, he wouldn't end up like this, I took the stuffed toy and he would yell at me to give it back to me. The last reason is that we had to wait in line for @NUM3 minutes so we could get back to @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. Then, when we were at the front of the line, a guy asked my mom a question, he asked me and my two brothers who were the two people in the front seat, and we said "it's mom and dad". He asked for this to make sure we weren't kidnapped. These are the reasons I had to wait patiently for the @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town.
A lot of people are patient and they wait because they don't want to make someone angry or screw up what they're doing. People are always careful about what they are doing. I can be patient at times, patience is not difficult, it is easy. Everyone absolutely knows that those people are theirs, they know it, trust me. Many different things of them have been waiting patiently, but I don't know which one I choose to write about because there are so many of them. “@CAPS1 someone is in the bathroom, be patient, but @CAPS1 you can’t or can’t hold it, keep knocking on the door or just use someone else, or @CAPS1 someone is on the computer and waiting for your turn, but @CAPS1 an hour later Go past and then tell the guy to get off and not be mean but you either need to get in and then it's your turn. At least for @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes you definitely can't be patient. Not too hard. It's easy, everyone I know you know that too.
I'm going to write about an experience I have had patience with. When I was patient was when I went to blur and it took a long time. It took @NUM1 minutes. It seems to have taken a long time. This is a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason it looks forever may be because I haven't eaten anything. There are my mom and dad there. You can also buy ice cream. My stomach hurts and I'm hungry. I have tried. Some are patient, some are not. I am a little sick. But this time I have no patients. Now when I get @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it doesn't seem to be that long. That's when I need patients.
It was early seventh grade when I had the patience. It was the fourth hour and the principal announced that the sixth graders were taking too long for lunch and said there were delays. So while the rest of the class complained, I sat there calmly and patiently. It's not fun to just sit there bored and hungry, so I just keep my cool. Then finally our grades were called down for lunch. That's when I'm patient with something.
My mom was patient in the queue to get her driver's license and it took three hours to get her license. She was angry, but she was patient. The lady who gave the driver's license came back and rested my mom waited another three hours and she was still patient I was there too I was patient but I wanted to yell at the lady for us to take a break and wait another hour for her. Another time my mom was waiting in line under the rum and it was burning and the only thing she did to calm her down was drinking it under 1 degree for about two hours and she was still patient.
When I'm impatient. @DATE1 On that day, I got up to brush my teeth, finished my lunch, and then I, my mom, and my brother drove to the doctor. Huiqi is an hour's drive from our house. I'm not happy because I'm tired just thinking how long @CAPS1 will sit and they're just waiting for the doctor to say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 but no, I have to make them sit and stare at the wall. Soo know here, @CAPS1 glad to sit back and wait because my mom literally told me "you need to stop being so impatient" thousands of times and I can help. Anyway, my mom just signed it for me, so I guess I'll just watch magizeens boring boring boring. None of them even imagined "come on" I said my mom said "you need to wait for @CAPS1 to make sure they'll call your name anytime" because it was about @NUM1 boring minutes. Oh, looks like it's time for lunch, but no, we still have to sit here and wait. Gosh, I'm so hungry. Well, the doctor just called my name and it's time to wait again! Anyway, they had me impatient for a while, I waited impatiently for the doctor and just sat with them, which is why if this has anything to do with waiting "I'm not interested".
Once upon a time, there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 is abnovius and always has to time it his way. @PERSON1 always waiting for his turn to share something. One day while watching @CAPS1.V. They saw a rocket building kit and asked their father if they wanted it. Is his dad calling? ? ? And ???, I it??? It world needs @CAPS2 weeks. When @ORGANIZATION1??? This is @CAPS2 week he? ? ? fit. On the other hand @PERSON1 said @CAPS3 Dad went to his ???. will pay? ? ? And @ORGANIZATION1 is always @CAPS4 dad??? because he can't wait for @CAPS1. @PERSON1 just think of it as ??? day. @ORGANIZATION1 will sit and watch ??? ? ? This? ? ? Lock with him. Finally, the day has come. @ORGANIZATION1 running out to pick up his rocket? ? ? . At that time @PERSON1??? was out the door. When do they have rockets? ? ? They opened them up. @ORGANIZATION1 is disappointed because he wants to play now, but first he has to build it. @PERSON1 took the time to do step-by-step instructions, his rocket didn't have time to finish. @ORGANIZATION1 just put the pieces together and it crooked and broke. Shout out to @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went to @ORGANIZATION1 and told him to help, and it was done in @NUM1 minutes. They played together and had a great time. Finish.
Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 Before @DATE1, the leaves were just starting to change color and fall overhead. My mother, sister, one of her friends and the mall crowded into the car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1 which is literally in our backyard. I have my camera and I shot @CAPS2 very thoroughly. My mother and others were very patient with me and slowed me down on the hike. The problem with @PERSON1 is that there isn't much of a roadmap, so you can easily get confused or lost. After a long walk on foot, we came to a man on the road where the map was. My mom checked her phone and told us we had forty-five minutes before we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggest we start returning so we can go home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time so we can make the long drive to the vet. Instead of taking my advice, my mother took us in a completely different direction. My sister and her friends complained about their procrastination. For the next mile or so, we kept going but didn't find the map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and getting lost. Because we got lost in the drab fields and trees, my mom had to pull out her dying cell phone and call my dad to get my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, which made me even more nervous. After walking for another half an hour, we finally reached the exit. I'm glad I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 It turned out great, my mom was always patient with us, we whined and moaned.
One time I was very patient was when I was taking an exam in science class. I was patient because I needed help, so I went to the teacher and so was the child in front of me. It took him a while, but I just stood there waiting. It took him about @NUM1 minutes because he needed help with a lot of things. That's when I'm patient.
I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help with things like school assignments or homework. Some of them take a while to explain and I have to be patient to help them. And I'll be realistic that not everyone has a lot of patience and gets frustrated easily, like I do sometimes. Sometimes I've been on the phone for an hour trying to explain homework to a friend of mine. Soon I'll be patient again as I coach @CAPS1. For me, patience is one of the most important traits a person can have.
I am not a very patient person. But when I have to be, I am. For example, in my house we only have one bathroom. I hate waiting to go. But I have to wait because I don't want to urinate in the jungle, so I'll wait. I have to wait for my bust too. I hate waiting for it to be so boring. But patience is a good thing. If we don't, there will be a lot of people dying in car accidents, murders, nervous breakdowns. My sister is so patient, she can wait in one place for hours, and at one point @CAPS1 I waited until the bell rang so we could go trick-or-treating. She waited so well she did her hair I complained that's one reason patience is important.
Fluff, have you been to the doctor? Well, on @DATE1 my brother, sister and I had a doctor act and we missed school. It was packed with people when we got there. So we sat and waited. We've been waiting three and a half hours, so I'm starting to get impatient and hungry, I tell my mom I'm hungry, and everyone: agree with me. So my mom went to the food court to withdraw money for us. Pizza and water. After we finished our pizza, we waited another three hours. I'm starting to get pissed because we've been here for hours. Finally, nerse said my mom asked us to stand up, and she said @PERSON1. So I got really impatient and I yelled "@CAPS1, this is our term, we've been waiting When I sat down and started waiting, a second came to our tern. This is why patience is important
Patience is one of the most important things in life. Patience is understanding and tolerance. For example, a mother of a child goes to work, she spends @NUM1 hours and then goes home. The child says, "Soon." This is patience.
For me, if someone is close to me or any of my friends, I don't take them so patiently, I see I won't tolerate my friends being provoked by people they don't even know or I don't know have no idea. Once my friend and I were walking in the hallway of school. The kid was overwhelmed and started pushing my friend and I asked the kid what his problem was and he said it's not my job to see you being picky on one of my friends so he stopped teasing me and tried to tease me but He didn't know I had my brother and other friends on the corner of bilding, so I asked a friend next to me to get them, so he and the kid who was picking up the gun I ran off.
I was patient one time when my mom's car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mom called her friends who lived down the street to give us a boost. We waited for her for an hour and a half. My mom called her back and she said she couldn't come because she needed an oil change. We then walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes and it picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked the rest of the way to @NUM1 miles and @PERSON1 where another bus took us to @NUM2 miles and @PERSON1 where my school is. That's when I'm patient.
Patience is waiting for something. Like we can say that your new shoes will be ready in two weeks instead of worrying all the time. You just walk around like a honnel. For example hunting you sit and wait for the deer to come. If you are an inpatient you will go find some. Sometimes a lot of people get impatient and mean about something. Patience is understanding why something is taking a long time to get done. You have to be careful if it doesn't come as @DATE1 as it should. This time I made an appointment for @CAPS1 at @TIME1 and my mom and I had to wait until five o'clock. We've never been mad at a small board. This time a friend of mine is waiting for his dad to come home until @DATE1
Patience is when you are peacefully waiting for something, someone or something to happen. I went to the doctor for an injection as a kid, but my mom didn't tell me it was an injection, so I figured I'd just go in and come out with a sucker. I once asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said just be patient. " I went into the room, shot and got my sucker. I was mad at my mom because she knew I hated needles.
The beaker in the @LOCATION1 lab is bubbling. I can smell the sulphur wafting from the beaker. "What happened to @CAPS1!" I yelled from the room "@CAPS2 found a cure for cancer!" @CAPS3 said @CAPS3 had a little jubilee dance that @CAPS3 showed off. I'm a doctor and I'm not sure, but I told him I had a patient with severe brain cancer. "@CAPS4 go try it!" @CAPS3 screamed. As I zoom into the car and wait for @CAPS3 to pack his lab gear. After @NUM1 minutes, I'm thinking where @CAPS3 might be. @CAPS3 It's just hard to wrap up what I said. So I turned on the radio and fell asleep. A few hours later, I woke up startled. I've been sleeping @NUM2 ½ hours! I rushed in to find him with a ball of fur wrapped in a lab coat. "I saved this kitten's life with a cure for cancer," panted @CAPS3. I'm glad I was patient, otherwise the kitten wouldn't have survived. Just when I was thinking how good @CAPS3 saved this kitty, my pager rang. @PERSON1, the lady with severe brain cancer needs our help. @CAPS3 grabbed a bottle of his anti-cancer medicine and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw @PERSON1 lying there, translucent like light on paper. I quickly brought her heart rate down. At this moment, I am not sure if she is still alive. "@CAPS6 for her?" asked the mad scientist. I made a risky choice. "@CAPS7, not yet." I waited five minutes, then poured it in. @PERSON1 resurrected. Although @PERSON1 can't speak, I can tell from her smile that she appreciates my patience. Her daughter came into the room and said, "@CAPS8 you". I just smiled back.
Whether I go to the dentist's office, orthodontist, or doctor's office, I am patient. The first time was at the dentist's office and I had to wait for my teeth to be cleaned. I usually sit there and end the magazine. The next place I have patience is the surgeon, I sit and wait in the first room, and after a few minutes my I-pod calls me to the second room, where I wait a while to get my wrist braces terrified . Once I get into the office, I have to wait for the guy to tighten them up. Finally the doctor's office, you sit for a long time in the big waiting room, the lady calls you in when you get there, and if you're closed, you have to wait patiently for the doctor to be them. It can be seen that many things require patience.
One day, I had to go to the doctor's office for an injection. When we entered the doctor's office, I had to wait in some uncomfortable chairs with my dad. It's my first time shooting and I don't know what it's like. Since I'm young, it's hard for me to be patient and I just want to end it. I keep asking my dad if the doctor is here, and my dad always says be patient. It got to the point where my dad got frustrated and he let me play with some toys; I didn't notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys that were glistening in the sun, I ran over. But after a few minutes it got so boring so I went back and sat down. It's so boring, I can't take it anymore! I want to scream! But then I couldn't take it anymore and I started getting so crazy and wanted to get out of there. But I didn't let my dad know because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out and said "@CAPS1" and I'm glad the doctor finally came to give me the shot. But what I don't know is that I'm going to be in a lot of pain these days.
I play hockey. I am the goalkeeper. A good goalkeeper is always patient. On my former hockey team, I faced a lot of @NUM1 with another goalie in @NUM1 shots. Most @NUM1s on @NUM1 shots don't matter, but some of them are, and they're the hardest to stop. My team has never lost a game, but we have a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team was ahead. That was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on me on @NUM1. The shooter slid in from the side and he sliced through the ice. Wanted to go down, but I stood my ground. I waited for the shooter to get to the point where he had nowhere to go and he shot and I stopped it. That was even the only shot of the game and I stopped it.
"@CAPS1 hurry up," my friend said. "I know, be patient," I said. Patience means you are understanding and forgiving. One patient experiences no complaints. One day we had a basketball game at another school. My team and I both went to the bathroom. I was the last person to walk into the stall. They all left and one girl stayed. Patience is a good thing, have you heard "Patience is a virtue? Well, if you're not used to it.
At one point, another person I knew was very patient when I stood in line for over an hour to get tickets for a show. This shows patience as I didn't complain while queuing.
Once was my best friend who rode and it was hot outside but our first ride was called @CAPS1. The line was super long, it was like going through a maze, and we queued for about forty-five minutes because of how the ropes were tied, but it felt like two hours. But I didn't really complain, except for my friend who kept complaining about how hot it was and how tired her big feet were, but when we finally got there, we were staring at the rolling and wondering what was going on. It was so much fun when we were on the roller coaster. I think it's worth the wait.
When I'm patient is when I want a Do I. for my birthday. But I can't buy it because my mom has to pay the rent. So I waited and finally it was my birthday. I don't have it, but @NUM1 months have passed, it's @CAPS1, I got it, and I'm happy. @CAPS2 The time I had the patience was when I had to take care of my cousin for @NUM2. I waited weeks for my uncle to give me the money, but he didn't. So I waited? ? gave me my money. But he not only gave me @NUM2, he also gave me a late fee @NUM4 and I'm very happy. This adds up to what my mom gave me, @NUM5, and I went ice skating and to the store with my friends. I spent some money on @DATE1? ? ? and added ??? on @DATE1. When I'm patient, they're @CAPS2 time, it's @NUM6 days before my birthday, and I'm staying overnight? ? ? Went to buy everything like it was my @NUM7 birthday the next day. I do everything I find fun to be like heaven at home.
patience. Patience is something I absolutely don't have! I take care of my mom in this regard. My mom may be a little worse than me, but we're both terrible. Sometimes we record TV shows and watch them later just because we don't want to wait through @CAPS1. Some other things I hate waiting are queues, people are late and just waiting. The longest I could be patient was about five minutes, which was beyond me. By the way, when I have nothing to do, another thing is the coach. I just wish we could turn a @NUM1 hour drive into a @NUM1 minute drive and still end up in the same place. I really wish I had more patience, but I don't know how to get it. I really hope you are patient enough to finish my story.
At one point, I had to be very patient. It was on my way to visit my family at @LOCATION1. It took four days to get there. It will take two or three days, but we stop a lot. My dad wants to go to all the shops and rest areas on the way. It kind of pissed me off because we didn't need to go to all these places, but we went to my dad. On our way, it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 calls us every five minutes on the road. He keeps saying how close you are, when did you get here, you got lost, did you buy me some coco wets? I thought that was really interesting. My uncle loves coco wets. I mean I like them, but not that much. When we finally got down there, my legs were sore from sitting in the back seat of my dad's car. I walked for two hours and let the feeling come back to my legs.
When I had the patience was when I went fishing with my stepfather at @CAPS1. I couldn't wait so I decided to talk to myself or sing. My stepfather said you put your pole on a slingshot rack and do whatever. So I walked around exploring the world and I was wondering how I could be patient. I was going to check my pole but I had nothing so I felt like there was no way on the coast so I sat and waited but until that moment my pole started shaking so I rolled up and grabbed a big @CAPS1 I'm very happy. My stepfather said to see you have patience.
I need patient time. We were at the grocery store, @CAPS1 people to be exact. m When we first got there, I quit because we would get a lot of garbage, but there. We started getting a lot of food and it looked really good. I started eating it all. The car is halfway through. ? ? ? @CAPS7 we got more stuff, @CAPS3 was full and we had to buy another cart and it was starting to get hungry. But when we were in the meat section, I was starving. My mom said "@CAPS2 I only bought a few things." @CAPS3 I waited, waited for @CAPS7 She told me to check out. They are all @CAPS3 long, I think I am? ? ? (@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6) @CAPS7 This little girl comes up to me and gets smart I can’t stand it, I was about to talk down to that little girl. But I have to calm myself @CAPS3, @CAPS7 I realize it's our turn and I'm glad @CAPS3. @CAPS7 When I got home, my mom cooked the bacon and I was getting ready for bed.
While waiting at the airport, I watched all the people passing by, thinking these thoughts in my head: "When is @CAPS2 coming?" @CAPS1 I waited so long, what time is it, his flight isn't supposed to be at @NUM1 minutes before arriving? Then suddenly a soft female voice "@CAPS2 is coming soon honey don't worry." I don't understand @CAPS1 my mom telling a @NUM2 year old not to worry it's in our nature. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself: what's the use of complaining? It just upsets you. @CAPS3 These things flashed through my mind and I regained my patience. An hour later, I felt my mother shaking my shoulders and woke me up. When I opened my eyes I saw Dad standing in front of me and I ran to give him a hug. 'I almost lost my patient' @CAPS4 Glad I was patient because if I wasn't it would have ruined my dad's trip. Patience is a good thing, you can gain or lose something from it. In this case, I think I have something to gain.
One time I was patient, one time we were the @CAPS4 store and I was so happy @CAPS2 went to the toy section. “@CAPS1 We were going to go to the grocery store first,” Mom said. I was really pissed that Mom said, "The sooner we get the toys, the sooner we can." @CAPS2 We are @CAPS3 Finished the grocery store and then we have to go to the clothes section. I'm really pissed. Mom said, "The faster we do it, the faster we can get the toys." @CAPS3, I had to try on clothes. I hate trying on clothes," I said. Then I was excited @CAPS2 because we're going to a toy selection, and I'm so happy @CAPS2. I looked and my mom said, "I can pick a toy. " @CAPS4 is @CAPS2 hard to choose, until I see a cool truck, I don't choose anything. @CAPS4 has a big try @CAPS4 has flames, @CAPS4 is green. I ask, may I ask ? One mom said "@CAPS5 you can make me happy @CAPS2. That's when I became paticene.
I patiently check my @NUM1. It took me a long time to get it and I had to be very patient to get this system. I brought ten mounts for my birthday and he and all gamestop's in taxlor got it. I was in the car for hours before we got into one at the first game station we saw and they had an insed it was in good condashi I got three games and that was when I was patient.
Once upon a time, in an army land, there was a girl named @PERSON1. One day @PERSON1 and her mom are going to @LOCATION1 to see a movie called @CAPS1. @CAPS2 By the time they got to the theater, the tickets were sold out, so they had to see another movie. It must be a bad day because once they get up to sell tickets and remember to go! @PERSON1 left for dinner with her mom. They went to a place called @ORGANIZATION1 and ordered! They ordered food and sat down to eat. Once they're done, when they're done, try again on the left with the movie @CAPS2, the line is a mile long! @PERSON1's mom just told her to be patient I told and listen? ? ? . While they were there, they finally got their last ticket. After that her mom @CAPS5 "So dear @CAPS3 have patience??? When they get home??? On the couch, having a snack, waiting for @PERSON1's sister and dad to get home. Finally, they??? , @PERSON1's dad got a ticket to the movie @PERSON1 and her mom just saw! "@CAPS3 been looking for you all day" @CAPS5 her dad." @CAPS4 @CAPS3 can't find you. " @CAPS5 her sister. @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and explained that they could go to the movies @CAPS3 was patient and waited in line for the last ticket!" "@CAPS3 also won a lot of money!" exclaimed @PERSON1. @CAPS6!
I'm going to talk about what I think patience is. I think patience is waiting. For example, "You're patient when you line up to buy marshmallows," Joker says. You know similar things I know this is a short story, sorry.
I remember one day my mom and I were waiting in the doctor's office waiting room because I wasn't feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said "It's been ten minutes for @CAPS1" "I don't know when I can talk to my doctor," I said. "I don't know, but let's wait a little longer," Mom said. So as we waited patiently and sat down, more kids started to come in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I signed I lingered. Is my doctor still there today? I stared at the wall, watching its color. Orange. Before I knew it, half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. "@CAPS1 is almost @NUM1! " "@CAPS2! " I said angrily and annoyed. "Are we just going to sit here all day?" " I asked. Finally my questions were answered and a nurse said I could finally go back to a room and talk to my doctor about my illness." @CAPS3 Be patient! The nurse smiled. I smiled back. I @CAPS4 are patient.
One day my mom said I could get this new toy at the store, but my mom had to do something else before we got to the store, so I had to be patient. My mom had to go to her work place because she forgot something. Then she had to go to the gas station. Then we finally went to the store and I got the toy I wanted.
Patience can show up in different lives. On the one hand, it can reward you at the end. For example, if you are patient, it will come out in a bigger way because it will give you a bigger reward. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example, you can wait for something and you can do other things when you deserve it. Another thing is, it can be difficult, but if you're calm, you can control it. For example, people can't wait, so they just want to get it done in a hurry. My last reason is that if you can do it once in your life, the second time is easy. For example, the second one won't be as hard because you'll be cool. This is my own patience.
I'm good @CAPS1 when I'm a patient, I don't complain, I like patience, I'm @CAPS1 good, I don't fall, sometimes people don't calm them down, sometimes when things are happening forever I sometimes Will sit down, I always get patents at school restaurants and I always get patents at Batman's places, sometimes I can't live without a patent, I don't want people to thank me for eating something I just @ it's weird CAPS1 It's ok, I'm in line for patents when I fail, sometimes long lines at shows, that's my goal to get all patents, but sometimes I'm not patented because sometimes something takes a long time and I just want to be patented.
In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about my patience. I'm going to talk about the time I played truancy and went fishing with my dad and uncle @PERSON1. I slept very little and I still get up at the same time as school. I had to leave the house before my brother saw me because he wasn't going with us. We got in the car and drove to my uncle @PERSON1's house. When we got to his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did, we hopped on my uncle @ PERSON1 's old, rusty, red truck. There is red paint all over the truck. We started driving and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching the boat. The boat is small. It's hardly for all of us. It's only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 feet long. When we put the boat in the water and started driving, I freaked out. We crossed a beautiful river all the way to the back of @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 is known as @ORGANIZATION1. It's at @LOCATION1. I was patient when we went in. I thought we'd get up so I got a new idea for fishing. It turns out we were just sitting there while fishing. We fished @NUM2 hours that day. I was very patient waiting for my float to come down so I could set the hook. "@CAPS1" my uncle @PERSON1 said. This means that the floats travel underwater like a submarine. We pulled out @NUM2 sticks in one fell swoop! @NUM4 pike and @NUM1 bluegill! I caught the biggest bluegill of the day that day! This day is one of the best days of my life! ! That's when I had to wait patiently for @NUM2 hours straight on @ORGANIZATION1.
One day I was in the store with my friends. I picked out my Slurpee and bought my Slurpee online. Then an old lady lined up. So to behave well, I put her in front of me. @CAPS1 After a while, she found herself one dollar short. So I gave her a dollar. She turned to me to say thank you and gave me a mint @CAPS1 I bought my Slurpee and my friends and I had to cross the street. We sat them @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes but it seemed like an hour. We crossed the road to my house. On the way to my house, my friend insisted on going to the toilet. So we went to the market. We had to wait an hour for him to come back from the market. He told us he was lost. We walked home, and that day, I learned it's hard to be patient.
Two summers ago, I was helping the kids camp at my church. I helped preschoolers for a week and it took a lot of patience. They were very excited and rude. They were always running around and yelling. I have to keep my voice calm and be patient with the kids or it will make it worse. Later in the week, I was in the care of a young, special needs child. He just couldn't sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was determined to get what he wanted. It's hard to keep calm. Despite the difficulties, I remained patient and calm. The little boy thought I was fine and started acting fine. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway, he says, "Hi!" Very excited. Glad I'm being patient now.
One day I celebrated my cousin @CAPS3 at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 house. He is about to turn NUM1 years old. So we played the game we played on the trampoline. They we come in to relax and watch some TV. After a while, we played with the dogs there. Then many people came. We went out for the third time. We had to come in @CAPS4 for dinner. We all eat turkey, baked potatoes, cheese potatoes, squeeze, beans. That's pretty good. Then they want us? ? ? project. It was a Jon with a candle. We had to cover it with tissue paper and it used a lot of glue. I had to be patient, I was the last one to rule. So I'm walled and waiting? ? ? Then finally I started working on my project, but am I? ? There was only one person sitting at the table working on my project. The results were actually pretty good after all. Being patient will get you very far in life. You have to be patient, restrained, etc. at work. So remember just be patient and you'll be fine. Patience will guide you through your hole life.
I'm going to write a story about my patient time. When I was eleven, @DATE1 my mother was having a baby. I can't wait, I'm so excited. We went to the doctor's office and we moved to her room. (me and @CAPS1 my mom's best friend) and @CAPS2 her. When we entered the room, my mother was in contractions and she was screaming and squeezing my father's hand. I was scared when she yelled and I didn't want her to get hurt. I walked out of the room and @CAPS1 and I went to buy baby @PERSON1 her first dress. When I learned to hold the baby patiently, the baby came home crying all the time.
Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this while visiting the dentist's office. This @DATE1, I have a dentist appointment as it has been six months since my last dentist visit. As I waited to be called in, a boy had a terrible toothache. The dentist decided to treat him first. I understand why they made this decision. I could see that the boy was in pain. Shortly after the boy went for treatment, an older woman came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal and they decided to check and treat her in front of me. I also understand that decision. After the women went for treatment, a little girl walked in and boasted about her first loose tooth. Her mother said she wanted to pull the little girl's teeth. I was really upset when the dentist called her back in front of me. The girl doesn't hurt at all. In fact, she's glad she has a loose tooth. It's not fair that I have to wait @NUM1 more minutes for her to have her teeth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience as my appointment was delayed by over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didn't mind her coming up to me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit every day. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be mandatory.
At one point my friend started waiting for a teacher wall where he was talking to a teacher. Afocer said he was talking to the teacher. Then she'll get the questions she needs. At that time my friend was a patient.
A patient is about many things. First, patients are expressed differently. Second, people either have patients or they don't. I admit that I'm one of those people who doesn't have a patient. My mom always said, "@CAPS1 your horse." @CAPS2 I know. I don't have a patient, why should she tell me I don't? I don't have any patients in the grocery store and I can't wait to get out, but, everyone hates it, right? Lines, lines, lines, I hate them wherever you go. Plus, it's really nice when you let someone out if they're in a hurry or have an emergency. Plus your kindness can't help when you have a little girl who needs to cut you. So you see that patients can have a loss, or some people have no problem with it. It depends on who you are. Patients have a lot to do with complaining. But not what you think, when you're patient, you don't complain at all, you calm down and go with what's around you. In particular, when you are in a difficult situation, patient people are more helpful than impatient people. Well, this talks about patients and how people handle, connect and calm down.
I remember we had to be patient when I got my new puppy. We have to be patient because he is not fully rice field trained and he is crazy. My dog is @CAPS1 and they are known for herding cattle. So whenever we went out, he would bite our shoes. I don't know why it tries to impress us, but it does. We had to be very patient when we were training him and it wasn't until he @NUM1 and a half years that he found out he shouldn't but (my dog) is still growing into a new hobby. We just have to stay calm and patient and then we can train him. @CAPS2 dop takes a long time to brave his hobby, so we have to be patient. This is my time to be patient.
My mom woke me up early in the morning and said I needed to get up and get ready. I asked what was going on and she said she was going to the Potter Park Zoo. I @CAPS5 don't know why it suddenly occurred to me. I got dressed and we hit the road. I didn't feel very well that morning. We had subway breakfast. I didn't eat my sandwich because my stomach hurt so bad. It seems like @NUM1 hours before we finally get there. I feel better now. We paid for a map and stood looking at all the scary animals. I saw @CAPS1 of @NUM1 wolves, snakes, monkeys, lions, pecos, camels and other animals. What a lot of fun! We got to this bundled cage, you can go in, the birds are flying around, lose! There was a little boy inside, and a strap fell right on top of his head! @CAPS6 My mom's phone rang. That's my brother. He said to go home because he didn't want to get up. I can hear my mother's birdsong. She went out and stood outside and I followed her and she said "@CAPS2 @CAPS3 because I said you @CAPS5 don't need to go anywhere." @CAPS4 I know she hung up. When her phone rang, we walked towards the fish house. "@CAPS5 never hang up on my phone! @CAPS3, I @CAPS5 don't need to fight you! It's going to be a storm and I want you home!" @CAPS6 It's raining and my mom is still on the phone. I got very wet and I really wanted to see fish. My mom hung up after about @NUM3 minutes. We walked in soaking wet! My mom smiled at me and said, "@CAPS7 is so patient!"
I was patient when we had to do mcap pacifiers. I was one of the first to finish, so I had to sit quietly and read. I read most of the books. It took evrey about an hour to complete by himself. Reading time is long. I get the board, but I sit pretty well so people can finish so I don't get bothered. Thean We brought a bathroom stand when each was finished.
an operation? ? ? . was when I was a kid. Patience is when my mom talks to my cousin Cindy. When your mom finished talking to me, my cousin told me she told me to wait for you, so I did wait until it was my turn. When are they? ?? While talking I asked my mom if I could go for a bike ride. I told my mom I could ride a bike without training. My mom came up because I was going to sargey. I am waiting for sargey. sargey is kinda like ??? so I'm waiting for it to be done. It's interesting
I test my patience, we are waiting for a???. You are now if you are patient, if you ever said @NUM1 you are now, if you are patient, you are now. Will I be strong? ? ? ? ? ? Becomes impatient at times. Yo will never be satisfied with our newcomer. I'm in a game and I have to be patient to see? ? ? This is how I got my pacemaker.
I was patient for a while. My cousins @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 are playing wii when I have the patience. I said I played winner @CAPS1, my cousin @PERSON2 won, @PERSON1 didn't give me the controller and she didn't share. @CAPS1 then I said she could play one more time and it's my turn instead of her playing four more times @CAPS1 I said @PERSON1 it was my turn and I didn't and she said "your turn." @CAPS1 and she Mom said "@PERSON1 you can play @NUM1 more minutes then it's your turn @CAPS2" an hour and thirty minutes passed and she still didn't give me @CAPS1 and then I said @PERSON1 it was my turn and I put up with it, or Give it to me, or I take it, she still didn't give it to me. I've been prepping and you still haven't shared @CAPS1 and then she says I'm sick of it. That's when I've been patient.
I was patient one time when I had to go to the doctor to get an injection for my sixth grader. I don't want to go, but I have to. I had no choice, so I got in the car and we drove to the doctor's office. Finally we have arrived. My mom had to sign in and we sat down. I didn't complain even though I waited three hours. The doctor came out and I was terrified but glad it was finally my turn. Then he called a different name, so while my awesome mom and I have been waiting in the waiting room, my beloved mom told @CAPS6 wow @CAPS1 you don't complain now. I know this is because @CAPS2 has become more mature and I have a lot of patience. Thanks to @CAPS3, the doctor calls me "@CAPS1 @CAPS5". @CAPS6 walked into the room with my mom. The doctor said you were grown up the last time you saw you. Does the doctor hurt? No, honey, it's not. are you sure. Positive, ok, ready, yes. So I closed my eyes and imagined something really beautiful. Doctor yes, cut. When did you shoot @CAPS6? I have done it. Really? Ya look at your arm. Wow, I never felt a thing I told you. Think you are the best doctor I have in the world? ? ? Thank you for your lovely pie. you are too polite.
I remember one time my sister was very patient with her birthday on the "4th day of @DATE2", she was so patient every time I asked her if she could do something before your birthday, she said yes , i can till my birthday i can' till my birthday because it's on "@DATE1" till the 4th day of "@DATE2" she is so happy I can't believe she is looking forward to her birthday, she Went to her friend's house and bought some of my own and then fired up my sister's work was in the air so well, that's my sister's patience.
what! I screamed in my heart. Sitting on my cousin's baby requires more patience. (she has more than me) @CAPS1 started @DATE1 @TIME1 My family went for a drink (I stayed for homework) Shortly after my mom left I heard a knock on the door. My aunt came in and whispered "You the most??? @CAPS5 started crying when I woke up @CAPS4. The first thing I did was pick her up. @CAPS4 is still crying! @CAPS3 I think she her clothes need to be changed. I changed her clothes and ??? kept crying. But now I have to be patient because who is yelling at babies. Then I thought @CAPS4 was hungry. Although @CAPS3 I have to read, But I don't know how to make a bottle??? (@CAPS4 is impatient, @CAPS4 wants her bottle) @CAPS5 When I was about to lose my patience, I made a bottle stick, sure if @CAPS1 is good) But @CAPS5 CAPS4 drank @CAPS1. Finally I put her back to sleep (if @CAPS4 cries again. I will eventually lose patience) @CAPS6 @CAPS4 is sleeping @CAPS4 calmly watching @CAPS4 wake up. @CAPS4 started crying again ( This time I know why, because @CAPS4 loves being held). When my aunt came back, my hands hurt. Although at the end of the day I found out that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby, Trust me, you need more patience with a younger brother).
I'm going to @NUM1 to write an experience I have had patience with. My advocate @PERSON1 is so happy that @NUM1 bought me lots of @DATE1 pens as part of my @DATE1 money. Since then, I have asked him every day. "@PERSON2, @CAPS1 @MONEY1 doing your daily shopping"? "No." "@CAPS2." @CAPS3 said: "Because I want my pen @CAPS4 @DATE1 present, remember @NUM3 owes me". "@CAPS5 I do, but please be patient" "@CAPS6 Okay, my patient is about @NUM1 falling apart." I've been waiting since then.
Have you ever waited in line at Tyne Park to ride the biggest roller coaster? Have you ever waited until all the chores were done before you could play with your best friend? Did you wait for your brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story, I'm going to tell you one time I had to be patient. During @DATE1 I had to go to the doctor for injections @CAPS2 so I could be safe. When I went to the doctor, I had to wait in the room for my name to be called. @CAPS2 is boring! I was thinking, "Will it take a long time for @CAPS1 to get a few people to take a photo of @CAPS2 I can leave?" @CAPS2 I had to sit there for about half an hour until my name was called. Then, once I was in the back room, I had to wait a bit longer for my mom to sign the papers and so on, and for the doctors to get ready for the injections my mom told them to give me. But in the end I still go home and play with my friends. This is what I have to wait patiently for many times. At least I still have to play with my friends. I hope you like it.
I got a patent while waiting for my chance to go to cicago. I really wanted to see the Windy City because my mom went to @LOCATION1. I tried to forget it before I left. It kinda works, but sometimes it comes back to me. Although I did have patience and I didn't bother my parents once about it. It took a few years, but I was patient. Sometimes I even forget I forget it. I live every day as if I don't care about @LOCATION1. No matter how tempting it is to watch @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 Eagles games, I'm keeping my cool. Then it happened @MONTH1 @DATE1, imagine it was @NUM1, I still have patience! So no matter how long it takes, I'll be patient with it in a nutshell.
I'm going to tell a story in my own way. This is @DATE1. My sister is almost NUM1 years old. We're getting ready for her party at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She has a beautiful dress and my mom is brushing her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if I could curl my hair. She said "you wait". I made a snobby comment and I was at one of the tables. I have been patient. Finally, if it's my turn. I sat there while she rolled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2. I'm the last @CAPS3 on the bowling list and I'll have to be patient for a while. Finally it was my turn. I bowled and waited. Bowling ball and water. It was finally time for the cake and I had to wait patiently again. Eventually I got my cake but I got tired of waiting for everything. When my sister opened her present, I was thinking, "Her @CAPS3 is slow," @CAPS3 I walked out there and shouted, "@CAPS4 get up!" I was scolded and had to sit for a while. I should have been patient all day, maybe I'll play all the games. This is the story I tell in my own way.
I have patience when I have to train my dog. "Sit down, boy," I ordered my puppy. Instead of sitting, my dog ran towards me and jumped up, snatching the treats from me. I went to try to get the snack back from him and he swallowed it. When @CAPS1 walked over, grabbed his collar and took him out for a walk, he jerked away. After chasing him for hours, he finally stopped and watched me waiting to run again. "@CAPS2 I'm done chasing you, let's go for a walk, please," I said, slowly losing my patience. I started walking towards him very slowly again. I got close enough to grab his collar, but the dog ran wild again, leaving nothing but a pile of dust. "@CAPS1 Done!" I screamed angrily and walked away. I started to leave and went up the hill to my house. I went to my room to get ready to sleep. The next morning @CAPS4 got up and went outside to try dog training. I ran out of patience yesterday and rushed out, but today @CAPS1 is ready to work hard and be patient. "@CAPS6!" I yelled as my dog ran to @CAPS2 and he ran. My first order was I told the dog to sit down and he didn't so I didn't give him the treat. I repeat, he sat down! After waiting there is finally some progress. I gave him a treat and he started wagging his tail. Seeing that he doesn't understand, I say it again. He sat down again and got another treat. After working with my dog, I started asking him to do more, sometimes he didn't listen, sometimes he listened. That was when I patiently taught and trained my dog and it definitely paid off.
One time I was patient and we flew to @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the school I asked. We flew fine to @LOCATION4, then to @ORGANIZATION1, but then it went downhill. When we got to @LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours! After an hour, I was tired of my little brother being with us and it didn't help at all. And then in the middle, we heard that we now have to go through security and sit in a room with a gift shop? ? ? All @NUM1 hours. With an hour left, another notification came, saying that there would be another three hours delay, and then I slept for three and a half hours while listening to my iPod. When we were finally about to leave, we walked to the six seater so that we could fly to a nearby island. When we got to @LOCATION1, we rushed to see my sister at the school on the island. That's when I was patient while waiting @NUM2 hours at the airport.
@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3” I can hear the clock ticking and it might annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small school building. Everyone is waiting on the edge of their chairs, why does @CAPS4 seem so Long? It's almost @NUM1 minutes now. The aroma of the pepperoni pizza is so intense I can almost taste it @CAPS4. It's a pain. Grumbling stomach, so hungry. @NUM2 seconds I can wait that long @NUM3 I don't OK. The whole class is so tense I think my brain is going to explode. I can't take this, @CAPS4 way too much. My eyes flash nervously to @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 seems like an eternity, @ There's no way CAPS4 can be @CAPS4 in seconds? @CAPS4 has to be at least a few years. @NUM5 Why is it so short? I'm not a very patient person, not at all. But am I patient? If I do, I can't see @CAPS4. I'm about to jump out of my seat like I'm being kicked out of @DATE1. I'm trying to stay still but anxiety is hitting me . If I knew I would In a rush for lunch, I've had breakfast early. Now down to @NUM6 seconds. My excitement has increased, but so has my stress. @CAPS4 is enough to crush me now. I think I might make @CAPS4 @NUM7. Mine Stomach growling again, this time, begging for food, @CAPS5, asking to be more like @CAPS4. "@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3," the clock struck me, taunting me @NUM8 seconds, I can't take this long I think it's about to crash. I can't handle patience very well. @CAPS4 is a ticking time bomb inside me waiting for @NUM9 seconds. @CAPS4 seems like the bomb and the clock are counting down together. All looking forward to my snaps. I'll show Show them. My will is stronger than my needs. I can do this. I'll show that I have @NUM10, "@CAPS10! " Finally, the bell rang, signaling lunchtime. I shrank like a squirrel sitting on a snow cone.
Some people have a lot of patience. I am one of those people. I have a lot of patience in my life. We're driving to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1 and I'm starting to fidget. I knew it was going to be a busy day for my mom, so I decided to read patiently. We were there before I knew it. I'm waiting to drink lemonade with my mom, we've been here for @NUM1 minutes. I'm starting to get tired of waiting in long lines for some lemonade. But I know my mom has had a tiring day because my sister keeps complaining. So instead of complaining, I stopped thinking about how long it would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had lemonade. I'm starting to wish we didn't line up for the @CAPS3 hawk because it's so long. I'm really pissed that it took so long to wait for a @NUM2 second long ride. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a headache. So I closed my mouth. I'm glad I was patient that day. Because if I wasn't that time, my mom probably wouldn't be as happy as she is at the end of the day.
One time I was patient was when we went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. We had to wait in line for half an hour. We were supposed to ride the cork screws. I am so excited to keep riding. So I decided to be patient. So @NUM1 minutes, once we get to the front of the line, I can't wait. So I quickly got in the car and rode. I really didn't like the day I had to stand for that long. But, that's what patience means.
On @CAPS1 when I was fishing for salmon in Little Traverse Bay, there was a tromendus hep on the trolling line and I took off like a rocket from where I was sitting and I was on the waiting line. I thought it was a false alarm (snag) believe me, I was wrong. Rally did a dance, then quickly bent down again. ''@CAPS2 on," I yelled at my cosin, who ran back to help me. We @CAPS4 stared at the water, the polls were still bent and motionless, I was looking for tumbleweeds because I felt like I was in an ancient The western movie booth. At the end I looked at my cousin and said, ''I've been patient, do you think I should make him real?'" @CAPS3 I'll go online first," he grabbed it in a huff, and said " Ready" my rope came out of the ball like a bullet but my rope slammed from him and then the rope slackened. My cosin and I @CAPS4 know what's going on. I thought @CAPS2 What Happens The man who becomes me is now swimming deeper into the water, frustrating more fishermen in his patient way.
Several times, my mother was very patient with me. When I get home, I tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school. Once we were sitting in the living room, I told my mom this story. My mom had the patience to listen to it as I went on. Although @MONTH1's story was boring and long for her, she listened, made comments, and never showed signs of boredom. The look on her face made me happy to know she was listening.
I was patient once when I let a stranger in my way to eat. When both my brother and I had to use the bathroom, I let him go first even though I was first in line.
Patience is a hard thing to capture. Patience, in my opinion, is a gift. Once I had to try @CAPS1, my patience was before the @ORGANIZATION1 football game. Part of it is driving there. This is @NUM1 and people are migrating to @PERSON1! We spent @NUM2 to @NUM3! I'm getting ready to run to the race! I can't wait to see this game! "@CAPS1 Your patience!" my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, I had to wait @NUM4 more before the race due to the traffic! How can I wait so long? Is this possible? I just sat on a lawn chair and watched people drive past our tailgate on college game days. I just want to scream I want to leave and go to the stadium: too bad! Finally we take off from the tailgate. Fun to walk with all the @LOCATION1 state fans and trailblazers. Now I'm sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. I had to question myself again if I could patiently enter one by one. I'm getting closer, actually using my patience. When it was finally my turn, I ran in excitedly, finally made it to the stadium and conquered my patience all day long. Glad to finally be there, get over my rush and let patience take over.
Once my grandma was in the store, I was very patient. Trying to set up the whole store, I had to go to the bathroom really sucks. I'm starting to get real; crazy because I think the store guy who's calling is trying to slow it down, so I can't use it. The only reason I'm not complaining is that most of the stuff and the basket are mine. I was very patient during that time
Every year we have a two week family reunion. Cousins, aunts, and uncles traveled across the country to enjoy these weeks together. We go to the town of @PERSON1 next to the famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is that it's a four hour drive, and if you know me, I'm not that patient. My brother and I take turns every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. She is the most impatient if you ask me! But once you get there, everyone will happily wait for @NUM1 on @DATE1 to kick off our patience. This is the story of my patience.
At one point, I had to be very patient. I had two waiting five hours before my grandma came to my house. Every hour I go outside to see if she's there. In the end she did, and I'm very happy. Some examples of patience and... @NUM1. Focus on other @NUM2. @NUM3 also lived there for a while. @NUM4. Even taking a nap @CAPS1 is an example of being patient.
My grandma was almost always patient with me, especially when she taught how to do things like cook or sew. Once my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to change the color of the thread and helped me untie it, although it took a while and I wasn't the best listener, it took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would be excited because either the cookie broke or my frosting was caked and even all over the bottom of the cookie, but grandma put up with my complaints and when I finally frosted it didn't crack and the frosting was very Smooth, she complimented me even though I may have broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient when she helped her make the carmol corn, there were so many steps, if you did it wrong, the whole batch would be ruined. She mostly made me do the easy stuff, she also made me make the sauce for the last batch, which was funny, instead of yelling at me to hurry up when I started to slow down, she politely told me to hurry up A little, it takes a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which requires patience from @CAPS1 as I'm constantly sprinkling flour, vanilla, baking soda and anything in the recipe that might fall off and I don't want to keep cleaning it when I do , I still left half of it on the floor. Grandma was always patient with me no matter what I did.
I was patient when I got the Raptor on Cedar Point. After two hours in line, my friends and I were getting bored. There was some music, but that didn't really make us happy. But I've never been on the Raptors before, and I'm really excited to be. An hour has passed. Then finally waited ten minutes until I started riding the Raptor, the best ride ever.
When they don't know when to go in and how to protect their food. Our times are much easier than in the past and they have to work hard and give everything for us. Our two time periods are very different. There aren't many days where I have the patience, but this day was one of them. I play a football game on sunny @DATE1 @TIME1. I'm the starting quarterback, I got @NUM1 touchdowns, I passed the touchdowns in the first half. We were leading at @NUM2 by then and the coaches eliminated all starters throughout the second half. I thought I would still play, but no, they put me on the bench for the rest of the game. It was difficult for me because I had to wait until the end of the game to get off the bench. I'm not a very patient person, so @CAPS1 is hard for me. I wish I never had to do this again.
I used to be patient; I used to go hunting with my dad, @DATE1. I was blind with him for a long time, waiting for the deer to come in. He said they came in at night, or close to evening. We waited a long time and when they finally came in, I didn't get one. Some of the others fired a shot and they all ran away. We probably waited another ten minutes and we were all there from @TIME1 to @NUM1. I have always been patient.
One day, my parents and I went fishing. The fish under us are crazy, but know that the fish are drawing water. @CAPS5 got it (I may add shortly) our dogs will come back like crazy no matter what we start doing in our lines, even if they have nothing. We waited, waited, waited, but still nothing. Every once in a while, we have to move again because of the current. After we've been sitting there looking at the house. I feel like there is something on my line. At first I thought I was tripping over a rock, @CAPS1 I started to reel in, the line came a little, @CAPS1 I reeled some more, I thought @CAPS5 felt like a fish was pulling my line, @CAPS1 I shouted , "@CAPS3, Dad, I don't think there are any fish!". @CAPS1 My dad told me @CAPS4 to do it. Eventually, I felt like my arm was about to fall off, but the fish showed up! Dad took the net to get the fish out of the water and I asked, "@CAPS4 is @CAPS5? He said, "@CAPS5 is a big eye. " I don't know what @CAPS4 can say. My first big eye! Daddy even said @CAPS5 was enough @CAPS6! @CAPS1 and we went home, sliced the fish and had walleye for dinner.
That was @DATE1 @TIME1 at school as boring as usual, my @CAPS1 came in on crutches and I freaked out and ran to her and she told me she broke her leg and wasn't allowed to go out for a whole moon. Waiting a whole month to hang out with her was difficult, but her safety was more important than my entertainment. Week NUM1 after my friend broke his leg, I did a good job of not bothering him, so I'm proud of myself, but I have to help her around school. After a few more weeks, she was almost better, so I got excited and went to buy her a present. The next @DATE1 @PERSON1 got off the crutches, threw and got back on her feet, that's the story of my patience.
I'm the type of person you would call an inpaient but I'll try to explain it in the best possible way, the only time I'm patient is when something that's on TV shows up to my friends, I always Be patient with everything @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and other things but I'm never patient
@PERSON2, down here I need you to open an envelope! my mom said. We went down the stairs because envelopes can only represent transcripts, letters, @CAPS1 cards or checking account balances. We went downstairs and we saw they brought out a camera and there was a star on the back of the envelope that said @NUM1 radio. We open @CAPS6 and @CAPS6 to say you won @NUM2 votes, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @PERSON1! I just looked at them in awe and my sister was horrified! Then, my mom told me my aunt was going with us! Surprises keep coming and going. Another huge surprise was the lines about the @NUM3 girls coming out the front door of @CAPS4 Oak Music @PERSON3. Then the security went into action and dispersed all the girls and we were pushed about a quarter of a mile from where we were standing. @NUM4 ½ hours later, we were waiting, then I saw the boy's head pop out of the music window @PERSON3 and said, "@CAPS5 girl!. @NUM5 girl screamed wildly after he said that. @ NUM6 ½ hours from that and they started letting people in. The theatre was cozy and warm because @NUM7 hours in the cold @CAPS6 felt good. Iyaz was our special guest to warm up for @PERSON1. When Every girl screamed their lungs when he came out! He sang the concert and @CAPS6 was a great experience for my first concert!"
One day on @DATE1, my phone rang. Not many people hit my phone. I rushed to my room but my phone was gone! oh where is it? I swear, I'm about to utterly destroy everything. I stopped and felt my back pocket, it was there. I feel like an idiot. I'm freaked out by my phone because I can't find it. When it shows up in my back pocket. Anyway, it's still ringing. I looked at contacts. I was stunned to see who it was. It's my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 started talking. She wondered if we could spend the night in her backyard. I was so excited, but that day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my father, he couldn't wait to say yes. I packed my bags and hoped to be in the car, ready to go. I really don't want to go to this peach party thing. I just want to be with @CAPS1. We are at the show. I got out of the car. My brother and I just left. We rode a few times and played a few races. All I think about is how much fun I'll have at @CAPS4. I've been waiting, waiting, waiting. At last! Yes, we can go. Go to @CAPS4. I can't wait any longer. I'm excited: @CAPS6 I'm at @CAPS4. it's time. I have no choice but to wait. All in all, that was the one time I had the patience.
Click, click, click. With every movement, my fingertips bounce off the armrest. I've asked my @CAPS1 to hurry up @CAPS2 I won't be late. I've told her a million times, "@CAPS1, you know how important it is to me to practice on time." @CAPS2 I slumped on the couch with my backpack strapped tightly to my shoulders. This happened to @CAPS7 when I thought my @CAPS1 had learned it by now. While waiting, I turned on the TV to keep myself busy. Unfortunately, with each flip, I became more irritable. "Is that @CAPS3 her? Why is she taking so long @CAPS2?" @CAPS4 like this swirled in my head. Then my @CAPS1 stumbled into the family room. She snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. When I buckled the seat belt in place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, writhing, the garage door creaked open. My @CAPS1 cranked up the engine and we sped down the driveway towards the highway. To make my luck better, we got stuck in the road. The car moved forward slowly, and time passed by minute by minute. The clock shows @NUM1 and I'm sure I won't be there on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @NUM2 and took a deep breath. Deep breathing helps to slow down my heart rate, which in turn reduces my stress level. "@CAPS5 passive." I told myself. "@CAPS5 Passive. Rest assured, you'll make it." @CAPS7 Suddenly my @CAPS1 slammed on the brakes. I opened my eyes and saw that we had reached the pool. Time reads @NUM3. I will make it! I blew out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I said to myself "Look what you can do. You go to swimming practice, @CAPS7 all you have to do is slow down and @CAPS5 passive. Good"
I was patient on my birthday and I got nothing. I thought I would get at least one thing, but I got nothing. I didn't do anything wrong, but I still get nothing. The next day I got nothing, I didn't ask for anything, and I still got nothing. The next day I had nothing. But that night when it was skating at skate port @NUM1, nothing came of it. Like at @TIME1 I saw my cousin and she gave me @MONEY1 as my birthday present. I thought everyone forgot, but I was wrong. I'm glad too. I have to be patient to get something without having to ask for something.
@CAPS1 in @DATE1. One day when my aunt @PERSON1 was looking at me, suddenly all the lights went out. So I thought we had a blown fuse, so my aunt @PERSON1 went with her to fix it, but it didn't work, so she? ? ? Called my mom and his connection was lost so we got our generators and watched the news and my mom got stuck on the freeway? ? ? I was worried so we finally got our phones to work and some of them were family members coming and we were so pissed that we didn't have any work for a week and we had to be very patient.
I've been waiting for almost two hours. When do I go get my food. I was hungry so I told my mom and she asked me if I wanted to let my cat out and I said yes and went and put on my jacket. Mom said I had to pick up Dad and wait in the car, so I went and waited for them for about a few minutes. When they finally came out, Dad asked ????????? shouting @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He said ok, we went. When we got there, no other stores were open. When we went in, there were about a billion people there. I am hungry enough to eat a pig. Metarorickly said. We went to the chicken section and we asked how long we were going to wait. The guy at the counter said about two hours. After about @NUM1. I started reading magazines and some people left, but the people in front of us were in those seats. We were going to sit down next, but it took about an hour. before some left. I didn't complain at all, I never spoke, and I spoke a lot. That's when I'm very patient.
Once I was patient, I went to the doctor's office. I went to the doctor's office yesterday and the waiting room was so full we had to stand. Since there were so many people waiting, we had to wait with them. We are @NUM1 and it took us @NUM2 hours to sit down! It takes a lot of patience as the waiting room time + waiting time for the doctor is about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in, I felt @NUM4 breathed a sigh of relief! It felt like I lifted an elephant off my shoulders. Although it took a long time, now I feel better and back to school, it's worth it!
Patience is sometimes hard to do if you already exist. But there are times when one of your family members is talking and you're waiting for something else patiently
I asked my mother if I could get a phone and she said no, not yet. She said I won't have a cell phone until @NUM1 grade unless I get a @CAPS1 cell phone to write now and won't get a real cell phone until ninth grade. I told her ok. But when will you bring it to me. She said you have to be patient. I told her I would, but as soon as she said on @DATE1. I said then that I will be patient and not bother you. That was the one time I had to be patient.
Once I was in a store with my dad. There was a line about @NUM1 people my dad and I were getting impatient so I told myself to calm down and wait. But I still didn't calm down and then the first person left and then started to calm down and wait for the next person to leave.
My fingertips freeze when I sit and want to. Seconds turned into minutes, into hours. My body heat dissipated like sand in the wind. I struggled in the mud as the slippery rain pounded against my skin. I should have waited. I was patient when they explained. But I didn't listen. I should have waited. I should wait, I should wait. Mixed words. My bones are cold and I'm only about @NUM1 yards from home. My legs were shaking violently and I couldn't walk. Wait, be patient, I remind myself. A police car was parked in my parents' driveway. I pushed my left leg through a mess of mud, and patience is not a factor now. Nine yards, eight yards, seven yards, six yards. I stopped and pulled my poo over my head, but the wind blew it away again, five, four, three, two, one. I am at my door. I raised my hand weakly and knocked on the door. @CAPS1. Quick steps, the door opened. I was hugged. "You should wait!" my dad cried, tears streaming down his face. I smiled weakly.
There is a guy named @PERSON1. He wants to make a video game for his @CAPS1-box @NUM1. However, his father had just been laid off and his mother had a low-paying job. Since they have so little money, he can't buy the game. After a few months, his dad finally got a job at @CAPS2. However, @PERSON1 still doesn't have enough money to play the game. After another few months, @PERSON1 finally had enough. His mother took him to the store to buy it. He was very excited. He ended up really enjoying the game.
Have you ever heard your mom or dad say patience is a virtue. Well, I've heard it at home many times, actually too many times. Patience is something that means you have to wait, like when you want to see a new movie on opening night, you might have to wait in a long line because it's a new movie. So you have to be patient!
The time I have patience is during @DATE1. My @CAPS1 @PERSON1 is excited to invite me to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with her family because my pacemaker says yes. It's been a @NUM1 hour @CAPS4 I think @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS7 It's been fun because we brought a lot of stuff to keep us busy, we watched movies and listened to music on @ORGANIZATION1 I had no problem waiting until we got there There. When we got to the hotel we picked the bad guys and hopped in the car to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @NUM2 was awesome. The first few were on @CAPS10 with tears in my eyes, so scary, then the music, so fast I felt like we were going over the track. Next, we want to continue with the malliniom force @CAPS7, the hour-long thread we're in. So it's no use trying to run away and then finally it's your turn, @CAPS7 it doesn't work so we have to wait, it won't copper so he told to use we can get a free pass to continue any ride and get ahead of everyone @ CAPS7, we only have to do it once. As you can see we have patience and want us all over again, I think it's well worth it!
Once my patient dad got my first goofy hamster. Patience is your understanding and tolerance. I am patient and happy to get my first hamster. I got my first? ? ? hamster. I got two of them. They are silly and they bite. My brother patiently got his ???. Patience is when you want to see your bad and get fired to get what you want.
I'm patient when I'm waiting for someone to ask me out ::) I'm still dating him today. His name is @PERSON1 and yes he went to my school when he asked me out and I don't know what to say now because it took him so long and I still don't like other people but him. When someone is not in a hurry to throw, they wait for something or someone like me. I didn't ask him @NUM1 times when I was patient, I waited until he asked me because if someone didn't like them they might reject you and hurt you. Well, if you don't want to take my advice, it hurts.
I chose to write a story about my patience. It was my first time hunting and I was just hunting squirrels, but still. All I had to do was go for a walk in the woods and couldn't move when I sat down. So I sat motionless for @NUM1 minutes and finally I saw a squirrel. So I took a shotgun and shot her in the chest. I was patient so I got a squirrel. This is my story about the patient.
My friends and I attended the @NUM1 fair. We really wanted to get on with a ride called Freak. The line was long so we decided to go to some other rides. We looked at the line and all it did was get longer. Anyway, we decided to go in line. It feels like we're moving an inch every @NUM2 minutes and I have to be very patient. Inside I'm ready to go crazy, but I'm calm outside, the longest @NUM3 minutes ever! ! ! !
@PERSON1 and his dad are planning to go fishing @DATE1 @TIME1. They got all the fish tanks they needed. Tackle box, nets, bait and lunch. They drove to the lake, got into their dinghies and set off. @PERSON1's dad was the first to find out. He caught a ten-inch smallmouth bass. It was too small, so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake is very quiet today. @DATE2 There is a breeze in the air. The sun was up, but it was still a little cold. Sit there quietly, patiently. @PERSON1's father is implicated again. He quickly put it away. This time he caught a twenty-inch barracuda. The other one was too small, so he threw it back. "Does the fish really bite today?" his father said. But the truth is they've been there for an hour and @PERSON1 hasn't been bitten yet. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break for lunch. They just brought sandwiches, chips and some water. They went back to fishing after dinner. @PERSON1 pitched his lines as much as possible. He sat down and waited for about twenty minutes before finally pulling on the rope. ''I got one. I got one," he told his dad, who was trying to reel the line as fast as he could. When he got it to the boat, they measured it. @PERSON1 caught a 14" largemouth.''@ CAPS1 It's like you have dinner tonight''. His dad said. They were out for about 20 minutes before going in for fish dinner @PERSON1's patient caught him a good fish.
When I'm patient, I shop at a store and there's a long queue so I have to wait to pay for what I've purchased. I waited and the guy in front of me had a big cart of food and stuff, so when he got up, I had to wait patiently for everyone to finish paying for their food and whatever.
As I've gotten older, my tolerance for patience has grown. I was six years old when my mom told me to wait and get my present at Christmas. After she said I was mad at her, I stomped back to my room. I fell heavily on the bed and eventually fell asleep. My mom came into my room and told me that I could open the present, but before she opened it, she said I needed to be patient. Now as I get older I know it best in attitude so when Christmas comes I don't care I remember the gift she told me to be patient because you may not get everything you want when your patient When listening to your mom tell you what to do, she can explain that I may not get much or what I want. So now I'm pretty patient with most things, but since then I don't want to rush to miss the details people have to say or I might be disappointed. Patience is a thing, and if you don't have it, sometimes things don't get understood and things don't go the way you want. Enthusiasm is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don't want to wait. Enthusiasm is when you quit. People get confused, so when kids get excited, look for details, don't say patience, say calm, because if you don't tell them why, they might mistake it. In conclusion, these are the ways I have been taught to act, so please consider my words, they will help.
One time before my friend @PERSON1 went to @CAPS1 point. I was patient on the way there. I queued patiently to get in. I patiently queued up to get on the speedster. I have the patience to go to all the rides. Once I had to go to the hospital to get an echo of my heart. I am patiently waiting for my results. I am always patient. It's fine most of the time. Once I went to @LOCATION1, I patiently went through security. I waited patiently on the plane to get there. I got out of the car patiently. I am very patient with my luggage. I have to go to school. I wait patiently for lunch. I am very patient with school. I wait patiently until get out of class ends. Like I said, I'm mostly patient.
@ORGANIZATION1's best ride was over @NUM1 hours. The bad news for me turned out that I'm definitely not a patient person. Like the one time I was waiting in line for ice cream. There were only two people in line but I didn't want to wait so I didn't want one anymore. That's my impatience, but I'm willing to wait for the best ride in the world. After standing in line for two hours, we saw a sign saying one hour away from this @ORGANIZATION1. So pissed I kept saying to myself this was the best ride and you can wait another hour, so I did. It was fun when we got in, but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds longer
@CAPS1 it's cold @CAPS1 it's raining and I've been wet @CAPS1 for @NUM1 hours and still no activity. All I have to do is wait. I'm hunting deer with my new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 bow. I'm a good shot, but not that good. I know patients are key to deer hunting, so I just have to wait. I now see a deer from @NUM2 yards and shoot @CAPS1 so my patience has paid off
Well, the story was finished about ten minutes ago. When I had to be extremely patient. Well, you can see multiple erasure marks in the background of my text. I accidentally wrote the second part of this test on this page! I'm so glad I had such a caring teacher who discovered this for me or I would have failed! While I was sitting quietly at my desk, she (the teacher) came up to me and held the exam up to me. I know that means bad things. When she said I was doing it on the wrong page. I almost jumped out, but I held back. I think patience is a great quality so you can get things done. I'm glad I have enough patience.
I wait for the party to happen. It was @DATE2 before I was invited to the zapzone party. He told me the party was on @DATE1. @NUM1 weeks he told me but still didn't go to the party he told me he had paid for himself. But it was a party so I didn't have @NUM2 weeks and I went to school for ten minutes shopping. I came back and he said he already had a party. He wasn't there because the party would take an hour or two, so I just let it go.
Everyone loves @CAPS1, they all have to be patient. Especially on @TIME1 at @CAPS1 @CAPS3. Everyone in my family is always excited and can't wait until morning, especially me. I was so excited that I could barely sleep. In fact, last year was supposed to be the toughest year. @CAPS1 I woke up at @NUM1 in the morning for no reason. I decided to go back to sleep and when I woke up again I only slept for about thirty minutes. I just can't sleep! I went downstairs with a few blankets and tried to go to sleep when I saw a ton of stuff sitting there. I sat up and looked around. I was excited, but I remember I had to wait until everyone woke up. So I try to go back to sleep. I would close my eyes, sleep for about four minutes at a time, and eventually stop trying. This is @NUM2 point. I open @CAPS5, play a movie, and wait. At @NUM3 o'clock most of my brothers are up and I can't take it anymore. I snapped and started complaining. I became very impatient. I was finally told yes and started opening my presents. I am finally happy.
I was patient one time, when I was in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @LOCATION2, we were waiting in line for this water coaster, and the line was really long, they have a line called easy pass, you have to wait for one hours, then went to this machine to get an easy pass, but we decided to have a long queue. So half an hour passed and I started getting real boards, so I asked my dad if he wanted to play this game called slap. So we played for a while and we were about halfway through and we started to regret staying in the huge line and we only moved to the halfway market because it was over an hour. After about ten minutes I stopped slapping my dad because my hands were red and his hands were even red. So we just waited until we were three quarters of the way there. After about ten to twenty minutes, we boarded the raft. We went through a cave and stopped forty feet. Splash into plenty of water. It turns out that the wait was worth it. So that's when I show patients. .
One time I was patient was when we flew to @LOCATION1. We are waiting at @LOCATION2. Gosh, I wonder how long this will take. However, the plane finally came. At one point, I thought ok, this is the last plane we have to fly today. But then the pilot said it was a @NUM1 @NUM2 flight. Then I looked around to see what I had to do. I have my I-pod, a book and @CAPS1 in front of me. Once we're in the air, I think I'll take a nap. But it only took an hour, so I decided to watch a movie. I read @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Another two hours passed. By then, I was starting to get bored. I decided I would read it. But after an hour and a half, I finished reading the book. Then my I-pod came out. I was listening to music until lunch came an hour later. After eating @NUM3 minutes of lunch, I decided to watch another movie. I watched @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and it killed enough @NUM4 hours. Then there are only @NUM4 hours left and I want to watch the @NUM6 season of The Office. Then I watched us land at @LOCATION1 when they cut everything with just @NUM7 minutes left. It was long, but I was patient and persevered.
When I'm patient is when I go out to eat. So no one can spit on my food. Like the one time I went out to dinner with my family. On my birthday, we all dressed the same. So I asked my dad to tell them it was my birthday. I want a piece of cake now. So he wants to tell me what to say, they? ? ? Give us a minute. So I waited and waited. Finally said give me a piece of cake now or I'll ruin this place. Then my dad said bring her a piece because she can do it. So they finally brought my cake. They sang happy birthday to me. After that I was happy to tell that I found them spitting in my food and eating it. I found out because before I lifted it, I heard some people talk about how they spit in my food. Then I said wait a minute and they said yes. Then I said I didn't care because I didn't eat chips. They said why I was because my fries were nasty. Then I rolled my eyes and walked away. But I don't do it because I'm afraid someone will do it again. That's why I have patience.
@CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a patient??, @CAPS2 decided to order them pizza? ? ? . The delivery guy told @CAPS2 to be at his house in fifteen minutes. @CAPS2 still waiting for his pizza in fifteen minutes. How long will the delivery man be late with them? ? ? after being late. @CAPS2 said he doesn't care.
As we drove back to the airport, we climbed into the taxi and waved goodbye to reality. “I can’t believe the airport opened up earlier in the day and called us? Exclaimed my @CAPS4.” @CAPS1 Neither can I. I mean all - here! That person is fast. Checked our bags as we rolled into the airport smelling that styrofoam. “@CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 @NUM1, @CAPS3.” @CAPS4 explained to the clerk, “@CAPS5 Sorry, so your @CAPS10 is full,” she told us with a smile. “@CAPS6 you called to say there was a seat available and invited us to swap @CAPS2.” “@CAPS5 Sorry @CAPS6, it would be unfair if we gave up our legally owned @CAPS2.” @CAPS8 another dashing Smile "@CAPS6, you can get the original @CAPS2 back if you want," @NUM2 @LOCATION2. @NUM2! What am I going to do in seven hours! First, my brother and I raced up and down the escalator. Then we took the shuttle bus to walk around. With @NUM4, I totally understand this place. Soon it was time to leave and suddenly the loudspeaker blared @CAPS10 @NUM5 to @LOCATION2 has been delayed by an hour and a half" @NUM6 now really? Luckily my @CAPS4 took me to an exotic restraint .Beautiful restraint is time to leave soon. Please don't delay any more?! No. I'm glad we finally broke @CAPS8. I learned an important lesson about patience! It's not hard @CAPS6 it's not impossible .
There are some? ? ? ? ? exist? ? ? ? ? ? you? ? ? ? ? ? Second, one of them is patience. Patience is when you understand things and tolerate things, when you experience things you don't understand? ? ? Complain when patience is. You have to be patient if you are going to have a baby or be my mother or any other job you have to wait for? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ???. These are just a few reasons??? Patience. The last reason I'd say you need patience is because everything in life isn't just? ? ? Give you. You have to work for it, you have to be patient. So anyway, if you don't have patience, you're going to have a hard time getting through your life. So these are the reasons I think you need to be patient. So if you're impatient, learn to be patient. I'm sure you can do it, all you have to do is try to know a little more about things and don't complain? ? ? There are many hard things in life. I only have one thing to say, and that is to try.
One day I had to put up with my big brother all day. He's going to get a phone I want, but I'm going to Yang to get one. So when he found out I couldn't buy it, he nagged me. I wanted to take that phone and break it, but I didn't because I had a cool game so when he got home I got rid of all the nagging. I went to do something else but he kept following me so I found a big shoe he couldn't get up on and hung out there before he left. After that I went in. But I'm locked out and I thought I had a plane? thanks for listening
The time I had varying patience was when I was about seven years old, me, mom, dad, sister, trouble and grandma went from the North (if we got my grandma) to West Virginia, most of the time I slept or Wake up sum to eat and play by the hotel pool. Sleep, then hit the road the next day. The thing I have to be very patient with is that we're going to have @CAPS1 there, so I want to open my present. At one point we got stuck, so we were slowed down for about an hour. So when we @CAPS2 got there, I jumped out and ran so fast that I could open the door and surprise to marry the @CAPS3 guy.
Once I was playing video games. I was around the corner waiting for someone to walk around. I waited @NUM1 minutes. Then he came. I hope he doesn't kill him past the boom assassination that's the time. i have a patient
Once a friend asked me to read this book, I borrowed it from her. The title of the book is "@CAPS1 @CAPS2". This is also a TV show on @ORGANIZATION1. I'm reading a book and one of the main characters named @PERSON2, @PERSON1's brother is a vampire. They became @CAPS1 because of a girl named @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 died because they tried to save @PERSON3, or so everyone thought. @PERSON3 gave them enough blood so they don't die, they become @CAPS1. They think @PERSON3 is because that's everyone taking vampires because the town found out there were vampires there. @PERSON2 coming back after @NUM1 years looking for something to help @PERSON3 out of trouble, I think it's patience. Waiting @NUM1 years trying to find something to help your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you don't complain when you do it.
I remember my dad was busy when I wanted to ride my dirt bike and I waited until he had time to fuel it up. When @PERSON1 wanted to ask a question he had but he had to wait and ask the question
When I was @NUM1 and my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house, I kept asking my @CAPS3 "Can we go get pizza?" @CAPS1 Every time I asked her she would answer, "If you help We, we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza". I don't want to wash the windows, clean the room, or wash the car. So I'm waiting on the playground in the backyard, swinging on the slide, @CAPS1 After @NUM2 mins, it's getting boring. After that, I knew I had to be patient. I ran from the mountain to the river and waded into the icy water. @CAPS1 I'm still bored. I got down the river and ran to @CAPS3. "@CAPS2 Are you done with @PERSON1?" I asked. She replied, "@CAPS1's house is finished and the car hasn't been washed." I walked over to my bike and put my helmet on my bike seat. The wind in my face is negligible compared to eating pizza, @CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the driveway is more fun than cleaning. I jumped off my bike and ran into the house, I turned left twice as soon as I got in, I looked up at the clock and it said @NUM3.m. My family always eats dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad comes home from get off work at @TIME1 to cook. I hurried to see if my @CAPS3 and my sister were done, "Are you done?" I asked rudely. "If you want to make it faster, you can help" @CAPS3 answered. "@CAPS4, well, I'm here to help", I grabbed the hose and sprayed the dirt and bird droppings out of the window. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning, @CAPS3 left a note for dad saying, "Let's get started!" @CAPS5 I waited @NUM6 hours all day for my @CAPS3 and my sister to finish @CAPS1, finally I got the job done.
One day when I have patience we all have to take the same ride at @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 where are we going to take this ride there is a lot of people waiting in line and I have to be patient because I am in the queue at the back we waited there for about half an hour and then we waited there patiently and the ride was stupid not even going up the @NUM1 set of stairs and then we went to a whole bunch of water park rides and went home .
Patience, in my words, is being able to wait a while without getting angry and without raising your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing because if you don't have it, you may never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think patience will help you succeed in many things. For example, my mom and I were driving by at @ORGANIZATION1 and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in line to hurry up, when you do something like this it most likely won't speed up. My mom is patient because she can wait hours without getting frustrated. I have very little patience and I can't wait more than ten minutes or so. Patience is a good thing because you may not get the job done. Most of my family and I don't have the best patience, but we do sometimes. I think it's very good to have patience.
My mom was happy because when I got home late from the park she was happy but when she took the phone away from me she wasn't so happy. When my brother got him and my sister, he was interested in him and my sister, but not in me. Just because I was @NUM1 minutes late, she said she had a little bit of a feeling before I did, and now she's a little bit of me.
It's winter when I'm patient and my cousin and I really want to get out. I keep saying "@CAPS1 you can go out". My cousin is pissed, she's having a seizure. I just sat on the couch and told her what my mom said. After an hour, I could go out, but my cousin couldn't. She is impatient. That's when I'm patient.
One time I was patient as I was hunting and it was a cold @DATE1 game and I sat blindly with my dad waiting for deterrence. It's almost eight and we've been out since @NUM1. We heard the calls of ducks and geese in the nearby swamp, and we could see the trees dancing in the wind. Smell the grassy trash dance and morning fog. Then at @TIME1AM out of nowhere, then another doe. They passed us cautiously, so I had my gun ready. Then came the eighth beam, and I shot through his heart and lungs. I also got him dirty. In the year of @DATE2, my patience on the youth hunt was rewarded.
@CAPS5 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 loves playing games with her brother @PERSON1 @CAPS2! One day when she played sorry with @PERSON1, sadly @PERSON1 took a lot of unpleasant time when it was his turn. @CAPS5 is very pissed that @LOCATION1 took so long. So @CAPS5 started screaming. As you can imagine, when @CAPS8 @PERSON2 of @CAPS5 and @PERSON1 heard the news, she ran to @CAPS5 and @PERSON1. She asked @CAPS5 with a worried look on her face. She told @CAPS5: "@CAPS5 darling, what are you screaming? I sure hope you don't yell at @PERSON1!" "@CAPS4 I am, but that's only because @PERSON1 won't hurry!" @ CAPS5 exclaimed. "@CAPS4 @CAPS5 sorry to @PERSON1 for not letting him take his time because he was too sour. He's younger than you, which means he doesn't know anything." @CAPS8, @PERSON2, shouted hard. " I'm so sorry @PERSON1!" @PERSON3 said tearfully. So they hug each other and continue their game of apology patiently.
Once I was patient it was my sister who got it. When we got the tickets, she took a ticket out of the michenie and it said #@NUM1 and it said @NUM2 on the screen. I'd say it should be short, @CAPS1 not like every preson is half an hour @NUM3 minutes, if you're lucky. We were in the strait @NUM4 hours for a long time and I hope my lisence doesn't take that long.
My name is @PERSON1 and I'm in grade @NUM1. But our problem today is patience. One thing you have to know is that without patience, you want to get anywhere in life. Wherever you go, you need some patience. No friends without patience. Patience will make you grow in life. Suppose you get a letter in the mail saying you must arrive at the Social Security office two days before. So when you go, you have to get your ticket number and sit down, it can take hours, but you can't just leave because if you do, you'll get what you want. This is another example, if you have to go to the doctor because you are sick, you have to wait, you should because what to do if the doctor tells you to go get your medicine, @CAPS1 is some result about patience.
Once there was a huge one. project! ! ! I need to know what my grades are! This is an important rally because it's the difference between @CAPS1- and @CAPS2! So I am vas????????? it will be a ????? and ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Cat "Here are some particularly useful payment methods, I'm glad she said my hand, @CAPS3 she saw my name, I'm glad I'm happy with the payee!!!! So I'm very happy with wanng's grades Be patient and see???? It should come out.
Being patient is like being a good person. If you are patiat, that's fine? ? ? will offend you. Some patient people got it? ? ? OK? ? ? Like moving, ???, and ??? but can you do with some patience? ? ? You are bad? ? ?
Patience is a difficult talent to master. Calmness is a mind game. Calmness is present in everyone's life. If you are impatient, then you will have more anger. Keep calm for the minors who have been trapped in the mine for two months. College takes a few years to seal. Patience is also required there. Whether it's waiting for a toy or waiting for God to save you peace, there is peace for people everywhere, and it's something that stays here forever.
This is the story of my patience. @TIME1 It's four and I'm in bed. A dead silence. Suddenly, I was woken up by the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my lights came on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, "Time to go, @CAPS1!" and I replied "OK!" I got out of bed quickly, got dressed, finished breakfast, grabbed my bag, and put it in the trunk of my mom's car. It was in the middle of @DATE1 and we were on our way to @LOCATION1. I know I have to be patient, so I popped a movie in the @CAPS2 player for me and my brother @CAPS3 to watch. It was getting lighter and I was still watching a movie while everyone else was asleep. Execute my dad of course he is the driver. When everyone woke up, we stopped to eat and refuel. I am very patient because I have to wait for everyone to wake up before eating. After we were full, we got back into the car and drove away. A few hours later, we arrive at @LOCATION1. I was? ? ? To get there, I rushed out of the car and yelled "finally". This is the story of how I am patient.
My patient @TIME1 time is @TIME1. Because we had to go to @LOCATION1 city to pick up and it took about @NUM1 @NUM2 minutes. Then on the way back we spent another @NUM1 @NUM2 minutes being bored on both trips. But I also had to be patient this morning because my brother was taking a shower and I wanted to do it too, so I had to be patient because he was taking NUM5 minutes. @TIME1 @TIME1 we're drinking chocolate milk, my mom will make it, we'll have to wait patiently for her to do it
Patience is important. If you are impatient, you can easily get angry. If you are patient, you will have more friends. Calm always brings good things. A lot of times people are getting sluggish doing something. It's a lot easier if they're patient.
Sometimes people take a long time my family is patent. My dad had to be patient because when he was deployed to a new country he had to wait a long time to see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her coworkers and even the people there really make her nervous. My brother has to be patient because there is always something in his mail that has been waiting. My sister is patient as she has to deal with me and my brother at the same time. My brother and I were very patient as we had to ride the bus for an hour with nothing to do and just sit there looking boring. My siblings were also patient as the school year ended. My dad was also patient as he had to finish his bait design which took a long time plus my sister and mom complained why we didn't need one. I'm always patient when I have to go to school with my brother, and I'm also patient when he has to sit and wait about 30 minutes for his computer to load. In short, my family is really patient, whether it's sitting in the office or deploying to a new country, my family is always patient.
Are you patient? Sometimes people lose their patients in many things. An example of losing a patient might be waiting in line to ride a roller coaster, because sometimes this can take a long time. Having sick people can be a good thing. Your cool, you don't have to be upset by things like long queues somewhere. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people who don't have patients because those people struggle when In conclusion, I think having patients can sometimes help you succeed in life. If you are impatient than you are, you should try not to because what you want or wait for will eventually happen someday.
It was a breezy morning. This is @NUM1 @CAPS1, my parents just finished wrapping @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. We are going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose ternament in @LOCATION2. It was a horrible thirteen hours. We started out in a van with luggage. My grandparents came with us as they usually stay on @DATE1. That pressure is even greater. We were getting ready to go and then I remember we had a TV in the van. I ran back into the house and unplugged my @ORGANIZATION1 game cabinet. I took all the wires and three game controllers and left. We started to travel. When we were about to leave, I started plugging in all the wires and game controllers. let's begin. For the first few hours, we just listened to the radio. Then there was the effect that my siblings were always not going well in crowded places, so we started hunting. Now @NUM2 hours and we are at @LOCATION1. We start to see mountains. They are great. @NUM3 hours have passed. We decided to watch a ??? movie in the last hour. Time flies by. It's finally done, and that's when I got a little patience.
Once my @CAPS3 was planning to go fishing @LOCATION1. @CAPS8 @CAPS1 Don't know. He asked me to pack my suitcase for three days of clothes I said why he said we are going to @LOCATION1 tomorrow with your relatives @PERSON1 and ryan. I was so excited I flew to my room, thumped the cloth in my @CAPS2, and checked out everything I needed. I asked my @CAPS3 what we were doing there and he said going to @CAPS4 river fishing for pike. @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I got a new cherry wood fishing rod and a really good backspin. So I get my fishing rod ready, pack @CAPS7, and go to bed so I can get up early. Here comes @NUM1, my alarm goes off, I'm so tired, I can barely see @CAPS8, we have to be at @NUM2's uncle's house, so I have to be ready. Once we got to my uncle's house, we met them and we all left. I want to sleep in my car @CAPS8 I can't sleep as soon as I get in @LOCATION1 the huge cliffs and hills are so cool we even have a bear @CAPS10 a river we parked on a river and we got on The river, where there is a clean mud pit with millions of frogs in it. When we finally got there, my @CAPS3 made me wait and unpack. Once my relatives and I unpacked the @CAPS12 we went straight to the store to fish my first cast and I caught a little @NUM3 inches on @ORGANIZATION1. We didn't catch anything after that, so we were back when it got @CAPS13 and hot dogs on the fire. We got up early the next morning just to fish @CAPS10 lake, @LOCATION3 we didn't catch anything. We fished the @CAPS4 river that night and still found nothing. The guy who owns the hut said we should put @NUM4 or @NUM5 pike @CAPS5 @CAPS8 it rained seven feet so they didn't feed. Next @CAPS5, we got up early again and caught all @CAPS5. I had a shot in the morning and we had nothing after that. For lunch we found a small @LOCATION2 for lunch with an actual rock cave and we scare a bear away from @LOCATION2. Then we went to this little canyon which is very hard to climb and I almost fell in half @CAPS19 @CAPS8 I was seen roots. We saw another bear eating berries we recorded, we killed a chipmunk with @CAPS21 rocks, we threw @CAPS19. Wham it almost took my pole and I played for about ten minutes and I waited and waited and it was a huge spear @CAPS8 it changed my course but I still never saw that spear .
Back when I was about 3rd grade, I had to be very patient. I entered the @ORGANIZATION1 contest. It's almost the seventh inning and I'm ready to play. I had to wait a long time. I've already missed an inning of the game. There were about @NUM1 people when I was there. It's so crowded. My mom probably filled up three two-gigabit memory cards by then. so boring. After about twenty minutes, they finally let us in. We all go through the outfield and into the infield. Most of us are watching live TV and I am one of them. After the game, most people left sad, but I left happy and sad. People are sad because @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. However, I am happy because I have to play.
For some it is as hard as a rock, but for some it comes naturally. Patience is an important part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to be heading for the worst. as a example. I woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I'm finally going to shoot my first deer! I put on my camouflage and hunter orange, and my grandpa drove down my long driveway to pick me up. The moon was bright and I was giggling excitedly, but I knew I had to calm down. When we drove to where I was going to hunt, I was amazed at everything. We went back to the blind on a trail covered in fallen leaves and put everything in its place. Afterwards, a little morning light seemed to peek through the trees, illuminating the fresh green fields. The water vapor looks like sparks floating in mid-air. We heard the drums of the grouse and a red square jumped towards us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting down, we decided to pack our bags. We always have tomorrow. So our hunt is over. We had a great time and it was all about patience. Patience @MONTH1 doesn't always help the way you want it to, but it can help you see many different and beautiful things.
One time @CAPS1 mom took the test to become @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistants. After the exam, she was very nervous. She waited and waited. The call will come soon, but she has to have a patient. On the first day she took the test, it was difficult to have patients. I understand because I feel that way while waiting for test results. It's nerve-wracking and exciting. It wasn't that hard the next day. She just gets on with her day. On the third day of the wait, she began to wonder if the call would come. Later that day, the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She passed the exam. It's been three full days for @CAPS1 mom to see patients!
Depending on the effect, it may be really hard to be patient. Even I sometimes lose patience. But at one point, I was about to explode. On a dry day at @DATE1, my family and I decided to go to @ORGANIZATION1 for an exciting vacation. We drive @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, then east to @ORGANIZATION1. After a boring road trip, we parked our silver minivan in a $5 parking lot next to @ORGANIZATION1. First, we ascended the @CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from incredible heights. Afterwards, we saw our cousins. I have never seen them before. When we were looking at the falls, my brother said, "@CAPS2, look at those boats under the falls. Dad, can we go?" "@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets." @CAPS4 My dad. We bought tickets and went in line. "Are there that many people at @CAPS5?" I asked. There were about @NUM1 people waiting in line for us. "@CAPS6 be patient," my dad replied. I stood there looking at everyone in front of us. We will never get on board. I see people handing out blue raincoats. @NUM2 minutes later, we still haven't got the jacket. We move as slowly as the plates on Earth. Finally, we got a jacket, but we didn't get on the boat yet. My brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing and almost exploded. Finally, they called us on board. It was amazing to be under the waterfall. We are in the fog. When we got back to shore we talked about how amazing it was. Patience will pay off in the end. It's hard to be patient, but I did it, and anyone can do it. I have been patiently queuing to get on the boat. Patience can be beneficial.
One day in third grade, it was the happiest day of my life. It was the day we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winter day and it was time for me to go to school and I couldn't' @CAPS1 wait until the school day was over because that was the day we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I get to school, I can't wait to tell everyone that today is the day. After school, my mom came to pick me and my sister home from school and waited patiently at home for my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home, my mom and my two sisters and I were in the living room patiently waiting to watch @CAPS1.V, just listening to jerouge's door open. We let it go and we all jumped around outside screaming, she is the best dog in the world @ORGANIZATION1. This is how I patiently wait for the best dog in the world in the winter.
?? It's a normal boring day on @DATE1, but I just got a call from my sister-in-law. She really just called me and asked if I wanted to go to Cedar Point the next day. I'm surprised! I do not know what to say! At first I thought she was hiding nearby, but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. ? ? ? When she finished talking to my mom, my mom was shocked too. I was so happy I couldn't sleep. I ended up waking up at @NUM1 am, I didn't like that, but it was totally worth it. It was a long two hour drive, but when we got there we bought tickets and ? ? ? Mavrick. The line was hummus, but we waited. Halfway through the line, the car broke down. I couldn't believe my eyes. I've always wanted to ride that one. I was? ? . We waited patiently for about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours, maybe @NUM4. I'm hungry and hungry, cooking in the sun. We only had to cry for ½ hour once it turned on again, but all in all, it was worth it. My sister-in-law @PERSON1 was impressed with my patience. We went to the car to buy something to eat. This is the best food I have ever eaten. The rest of the time was awesome, but it was definitely the most patient of my life. Since it's just me and @PERSON1, I guess that's why I'm so calm. As bad as that part of the day was, it was still a great time we had!
Mom married my new stepdad this year. I guess he wanted us to "connect" so we started trap shooting. It's pretty much the same as flying saucer shooting, it's actually the same. Anyway, he used to be a cop and had a shotgun, so we went out and tried it. It didn't work out. I missed every bird I aimed at with the jet. I only have a bb to pass this thing. But I'm cool with it I'm new I suck because it's the first time. So we try to hit the dead center of that thing. I feel there. We only played ten times that day, and there were countless turnovers. I feel very down. In the next week, we will try again. He pulled the bird up and it was almost like I saw its ark in slow motion. I followed it with the ball at the end of the gun, pulled the tricycle, and I watched the bird explode. Haha how did I do that? We fired another and I hit it and I went @NUM1 in the arrow! Awesome for a guy who missed all about a few things and that's my patience.
When I'm patient is when our house goes to @CAPS1 o'clock. My family and I often go to @CAPS1 point. Usually, queues are long, sometimes over an hour! Once, on my first use of @CAPS3, I waited @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We spent about @NUM2 hours and then they ran into some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 minutes, the line moved again. When I started riding it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds) A few years later the new ride @CAPS4 opened and it looked fun but the lines were not. I don't know how long we waited, but when we got to the end and got on the wagon, it was awesome. I'm glad I was patient enough to get in the long queue.
What is patience? Patience means you are understanding and forgiving. A patient person encounters difficulties without complaining, and most people these days are impatient. Patience is like waiting. For example, if you're stuck in traffic while you're in a long line, or you may have to wait for your turn to do something. Patience is one of the best qualities a person can have. Every year more people become impatient. @CAPS1 wants people to "hurry up" or "move faster". @CAPS1 Need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down. I think if everyone has patience, the world will be more peaceful, there will be no more conflicts, and if this happens one day, everyone's life will be perfect.
@PERSON3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2. One day Vincenta was walking and @CAPS9 saw his friend @PERSON5. "@CAPS3, one - @PERSON3". Say @PERSON5, " @PERSON5 you know call me @PERSON3", reply @CAPS4. (@CAPS5-shen-tay) "@PERSON3, my mom told me to watch out for @CAPS12 beans to reach @PERSON1. Would you do it for me?" @PERSON5 asked "cee, @CAPS21 of @LOCATION2 have each other's backs. " @CAPS6 you @CAPS28! I have to go! goodbye! @ PERSON5 said @CAPS9 ran away. @PERSON3 went to @PERSON2's house and knocked on the door. @CAPS16 replied. @CAPS7 @PERSON3 went to @LOCATION1's old house. Abandoned, "I know!" I'll be here @CAPS8 them! " @CAPS7 @CAPS9 dug a hole and planted beans. @NUM1 minutes later, @CAPS9 is still waiting. "@CAPS8! " @CAPS9 shouted. @PERSON4 is walking, soul @PERSON3 is pissed. '@CAPS4, @CAPS14 Are you a screaming boy? You're waking up my dad!" @CAPS11 exclaimed, "@CAPS12 stupid Beans won't grow up @PERSON4." @CAPS9 replied: "@CAPS14 Do you want to see Beans? Go to bed, they'll be down there!" @CAPS11 told him. "@CAPS16! I live here! Eizel will support me, haven't you heard of that "@CAPS17"?" @CAPS18, @CAPS19 See you later @PERSON3. " @CAPS11 walked away. The next day @PERSON5 passed by "OMG! @PERSON3" shouted @CAPS9. @PERSON3 woke up, can't believe what @CAPS9 saw. Beanstalk runs @CAPS21 on a two-story building in @LOCATION1. "You stink! "@CAPS20 cavd @CAPS21 Suddenly @PERSON3 woke up. It was a dream, @CAPS9 watching @CAPS23. "@CAPS24! " Still not. A day later @CAPS9 is still waiting hungry, @PERSON4 is back." @PERSON5 don't know, @CAPS9? Well, @PERSON3 please come in and forget the seed. "@CAPS16", @CAPS9 screamed. "You only piss yourself off" @CAPS16! Leave! @CAPS9 screamed. "@CAPS27! I will" and @CAPS11 stomped again. Two @DATE1 waits finally popped up. One lived and lasted for @NUM1 minutes then died. The other is just a car bolt. @PERSON3 has @DATE1's bone bug and put air in @NUM3. Then @CAPS9 asked himself: "Is it worth it?" cee - yes @CAPS28 - friend
Patience is a very difficult thing, most people are very bad at it, but some people are very good. I'm one of those people who is not good at it. The hardest thing I've ever done in my life was stand in line for three and a half hours just to ride a race car at Cedar Point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and Cedar Point was packed. There are flies everywhere, scratching your legs, buzzing in your ears, and even biting you. You can hear the screams of overweight people in shorts and tank tops eating popcorn from a mile away. This is cruel! I've ridden it every time except for high speed racers. A speed car is a vehicle that takes you to the highest point and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem is that if you want the first cart that @CAPS3 did, it's a three and a half hour wait! "@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 ride the skyscraper again" I pleaded. "@CAPS2! @CAPS3 all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 won't leave without riding the funniest ride! You're on the line and waiting!" @CAPS1 responded quickly. "@CAPS5! I'll never get what I want!" "You get everything you want. You can ride the skyscraper again if you want, but I'll live here! I'm here for those who have to sit The people around you feel sad because they're all going to have bruises and scratches on their arms. Heck, you could burst their eardrums by screaming!" "Well, I don't want to put people through that pain, but I might!" By the time @CAPS3 finished the fight, with only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didn't get the cart ahead and the wait wasn't even that bad.
The time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class with his project. We're doing a science project and this kid doesn't know anything about it. He will misplace things, write things that are not scientific, and he doesn't listen to anything, so he's right, but he loses! I can't believe he lost all our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was patient with him. After three days, we were almost done with it. When he did the finishing touches, he showed it and got an A+; @CAPS1 he got an A+, which makes me feel good and my hard work and patience with him paid off. In the end, patience will make you feel good, and so will the people you help. This is when I have patience.
There was once a little girl named @PERSON2 @CAPS10 who was an important girl in the narrative realm. Narrative is a small land of people loving and patiently waiting for everything. Every kid is patient except @PERSON2. @PERSON2 is an only child living with her mother and @CAPS12. @PERSON2 hates being the only child: @PERSON2's mother named @CAPS3 told her husband @CAPS1 they should freeze again so @PERSON2 won't be the only one. Soon they told @PERSON2 that @CAPS10 will have a brother or sister @PERSON2 would be delighted to hear. Actually @PERSON2 is so happy that @CAPS10 ran up the stairs and started naming babies. Then ran down the stairs, sharing with her mother that they were shaking in her chains. I love how kuven said that @CAPS12 walked to the table where @PERSON2 and her mother were located. Ok says @PERSON2 is cleaning the table "Do you prefer @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or @CAPS6". @PERSON2. I love that @PERSON1 said @CAPS12 was pushing his chair. I also said that Mom took the stairs to her bedroom. "I can't wait for the baby to come," @PERSON2 said on the way up the stairs. The next morning @PERSON2 woke up early to see if her mom had any kids. " @CAPS7 you have a baby" @PERSON2 said of debilitating her mother, @CAPS12 "@CAPS8" said @CAPS12, "Baby must grow inside of mother. Okay, @PERSON2 said. @NUM1 months later .Kerry woke up early screaming "here @CAPS7 it's coming" @CAPS8," mother said, putting her head on her stomach to watch @PERSON2. " That kid will never come, I hate that stuff that I'll be alone forever," @PERSON2 said as she walked towards her bedroom. Be patient @CAPS10 will scream @CAPS12 from another room. "@CAPS10" said @PERSON2 it's a girl" @PERSON2 was very happy @NUM1 hours later "oh oh oh" mom screamed from her bedroom. "Are you okay mom" @PERSON2 walks into mom "Baby here, call you @CAPS12" Mom said. "@PERSON2" Yes, "Mom has to give birth to this baby. @NUM3 hours later, dad ran up the stairs home, walked into his room and saw @PERSON2 his wife @CAPS11 asleep with newborn baby @PERSON1. Tell you that if you're patient @CAPS10 will come and "speak" @CAPS12 to himself
Some stories of my patience were when I needed help from a teacher, grandma had surgery, waited for exercise, waited for mom to go to work. We waited three hours when my grandma had surgery. During that time, my aunt and I played chess. I talked to them. We went to the gift shop there. We also went to the mall. The teacher gave us homework (hw) and I didn't understand part of it. The teacher is helping another person, so I wait. I skip the part back and then the teacher can help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom takes me to her work after school or I'll be home alone. While waiting, I dragged the floor. I bowed my head and put it on the table. Talk to some of the staff and pass the time by walking back and forth. These are stories about when I was patient.
@CAPS2 When Dad is patient. @CAPS2 Dad is patient as he has an important meeting with his boss yet, so @CAPS2 Dad sits and waits. He waited, @NUM1 hours later, the boss came and said "@CAPS1 you wait another hour because I need to talk to @CAPS2 wife because she said she really needs to talk to me" @CAPS2 Dad Saying "@CAPS3 but hurry up!" Hours later @CAPS5 boss came, he came, he said "@CAPS4 wait" to @CAPS2 dad @CAPS5 finally he finished his session. I said dad it took you so long" he said be patient. That's when @CAPS2 dad got patient.
@CAPS1 @CAPS1 My phone is buzzing in my pocket. Lexa, @CAPS2. I don't know if I can get over our argument yesterday after she called me some names. I actually answered it once and said, I need some time @CAPS5 to be patient. She absolutely doesn't listen. So, I decided to call her back. She answered the first bell. @CAPS3, are you there? She sounded desperate and wanted to call me "yes" by the nickname she always had. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. "I told you I need time and you need patience.'' I said almost in tears.''I know but I can't do this when I @CAPS5 hurt my best friend''.''Patience Means you understand & tolerate waiting without complaining''.' '@CAPS4''.''@CAPS5 try to be patient, @MONTH1 is you won't complain''.''@CAPS6'' she said and hung up Of course I think I'm so pissed that she thinks she can @CAPS5 can and everything will be better. She should have waited. I'm just she's patient."
One day it was me and my mom we were going to the store @CAPS1 we had to pick up my big brother from basketball practice @CAPS1 we got there and he wasn't out @CAPS1 my mom called him he didn't answer @CAPS1 my mom kept Calling @CAPS1, my mom said to wait until he's out, now that's what I call patience.
There was a time when people I knew were very patient. @DATE1 I was cold that day and I was at school. My teacher was very ill, so we found a replacement. He's a very mean bench. Suddenly, a child began to breathe heavily. He needs his inhaler. I told the sub kid need to get it but he said no. The guy next to me said it, but she was patient in saying "okay" @CAPS1 subs let the kid go. That's when someone I know has patience.
patient! I'm patient when I wait for my football game. It was @DATE1 @TIME1 and I went to get my shoulder pads, helmet and football pants. We woke up early @CAPS3, though we'll be the first to be wrong in my opinion. There are @NUM1 people there. I'm terrified man terrified! I said to my mother, "You said to be early, you said to be the first to hear". Well, she's totally worn out. I'm mad at her. We were the last in line. All the good helmets are gone. Mom said: "@CAPS1, you need to be patient like any other parent. @CAPS3 I try to be patient. It worked out nicely @CAPS3. I'm impatient @CAPS3, I'm yelling, 'We don't have Time keeps you sitting all day, we don't have time for Christmas. @CAPS2 When I got there, I said out loud "@CAPS2! Football stuff is mad at me," @CAPS3" I said "I wish they had my size for my football. Exactly what they didn't do. I'm @CAPS3 crazy, as she said "come back tomorrow with your size. Well, that's my story, I was a little patient at the end, but at the beginning I yelled, @CAPS3 this shows If you're impatient, you may not get what you've been waiting for all day.
My favorite book, now a movie, I must see. Twilight, my mom and I are going to the cinema and I don't want to talk about this movie anymore. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 had nowhere to park. My mom was leaving before I said "a mom from @CAPS1," she replied. My mom and I waited three months for this blood-sucking movie, then walked into the building and we hurried to get tickets and food. The movie will start at @NUM1. I was about to start to say something, but I calmed myself down and persisted patiently for three hours. I took funny pictures of me and my mom. We do a bunch of random things to pass the time. It actually helps security staff give time for chores. They asked a bunch of questions about the last movie "@CAPS2 @CAPS3" and I raised my hand to answer that, and I had the option of getting free popcorn or pins. I got the pins. I'm so excited that the movie is about to start. My mom and I went home after the movie and we fell asleep when we got @CAPS1. This is the story of my patience.
"?? We can watch @ORGANIZATION1." I looked at the clock. Half past five. "You have to wait," I said. "@CAPS3 won't show up until 8." "@CAPS1 I want to see @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 z @ORGANIZATION1. He??? No. I think. Do we have to go through this every day. Why haven't I??? I Walked slowly to my room, knowing I had to keep???@CAPS2.???until 8 "kumehnn" @CAPS2 be quiet." I started going crazy. "@CAPS3 doesn't start until eight."
I never have patience. Weather waiting for dinner or waiting for friends, I'm never impatient. The only time I can be patient is when school starts. If I wait for school to start, I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years. And then also the thing I can never be patient with is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I would run around the house for hours until a friend called. ?? When they call, I rush to the phone and answer right away. I would even sit there staring at the phone waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient with is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean the room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back until bedtime so I never have to clean my room.
My cousin was patient as we waited in line at (Cedar Point) for @CAPS1. The queue took almost @NUM1 hours. My cousin simply kept silent (cvery unasul), just waiting. I am very impatient. I was banging my feet and running around etc. I'm dying of boredom. My legs hurt, I'm hungry, I'm too hot. I just can't stand it. She just stood there and didn't speak. When we started moving, I was kind of happy, but still impatient. After @NUM1 hours, we finally got in the car. After the ride, I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said when we got back to @LOCATION1 her mom said we each said we had a minute for homework. I was stuck doing my homework for the entire next week. This is how I learned the lesson of patience
Patience means you don't complain when you're in a bad situation. Some people are impatient, some people are very patient. Patience is very important in my opinion, and I like to think that I am a little bit patient, or that I think I am. Once when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1 I had to be very patient and it wasn't fun. A bad thing is that you always have to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privilege to go, you want it more when you want to be taken away. But I keep telling myself to be patient and we'll stop at the next place. Another thing is that you are always hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times, which was no fun. Also, whenever you have food is not enough. But I am not complaining. Finally, you really want to get there, you can't wait to see the sand and waves. Like we'll never get there, it's not the best experience. When we finally got there, I realized that the trip was like a big test of patience, I pasted, it wasn't actually as bad as the return trip.
I went to the hospital one day and the nurse gave me an ivy, akat scan and pulled the tare on my arm. It hurts badly, but I've been patient. First of all, when I did the cat scan, I didn't want to do it, but we had to, so I did and was very patient. Also, when they gave me my ivy, they missed my futility, so mature it put it on my other arm, so I was very patient with the pain. Finally, when I finished at @NUM1pm and started at @NUM1pm, I had a big piece of tape on my arc for @NUM3 hours and the nurse came over and said "we can go home now" and said "you can Take honey, now record." I said "Ok" I pulled it little by little and the nurse said "let me do it!" She said "@NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6" and pulled it off , it hurts so much, but I was patient and didn't cry yet? ? ? Now you know I'm patient and hurt all day.
I was patient when my dad said he would give me some @CAPS1. They are @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 shoes leading to @MONEY1. I asked several times. He didn't answer so I knew what to do. I decided to wash the dishes and clean the room. I waited badly for shoes; I cleaned what was already clean. After a month of cleaning, the shoes still haven't been received. That's how things go wrong. School! ! ! ! ! ! ! I didn't do well in school. I put my stuff together. Then I got @CAPS4.
Don't you just enjoy waiting for something to come or happen when you realize it's all worth the wait? I know I know! Sometimes it's too long to wait, you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I had to be patient many times before. Lately, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I'm just so excited I can't keep myself together. Now just yesterday, she was born. I'm glad the wait is over. However, I still have to be patient with her. But there won't be much more time before I leave school. I've been waiting so long, I can't even stand it! Every day I make a mark on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. However, life doesn't always go by fast enough. I keep asking my mom how many days are left. That is pure pain! As the day drew nearer, I became more excited. She gets a lot of clothes from people. I have to be more patient to see the clothes on her. I also had to hold her patiently. Although I did say before, I had to be the first cousin to hug her. Now that she is born and finally here I am the first to hold her and I can stop the countdown and see her in her new clothes and stop bothering my mom. So, all in all, patience is important. If you use it, what you're waiting for will be much better.
Patience is a good thing, people have patience and still complain that it's not patience at all. Be patient and be nice while you do this. It's really not cool to lose patience easily, and it's great if you're talking to someone on the phone or even on the internet or something when someone is waiting for you. If you have patience, it's very polite, I don't know the definition of it, but I'm just guessing, I think it's someone who waits patiently and quietly for each other, even if they need to go somewhere.
Oh, and I'll be able to ride my horse and go hunting at seven; the able man has been suggesting that alex mictiory ad man is a fun place to be? ? ? This? ? ? this route. Because I was in line to ride??? I became very ???. When my brother said calm down was half way, "No I can't, it's a long line, and Alex replied" "You What would be done here to speed up the tires, try to tell her the reason at hand in performance or talk to us" "okay? replid alex" so or I'm going to talk to the reple ahead of me, we used to get to the ridi already in??? Out a lot of info I thnked my brother out. I got hold of one and found a ??? reson. It was about patient time for me Alex and my brother to help.
Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It's not easy to be patient, but some people are patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone but you don't. My brother was always patient with me, especially when I looked back and wished I could erase it. Just that night, I'm going to live at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncle. I've been having a hard time staying in place because I'm sick and crying. That's exactly what happened that night @CAPS2 I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6 and I play games in their room. I can't stop thinking about my mom. I tell myself "upper lip stiff" over and over again. I forgot about her for a while and then the feeling got stronger, so I thought how much fun I'd have tomorrow if I stayed. It didn't work, the tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 did. "I want to go home" I managed to sniff. I ran downstairs to tell my cousin @PERSON1 he was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and took me upstairs to answer the phone. My mom replies and thinks that's my voice, then grumbles "@CAPS2". I sniffed and said, "I want to go home, I miss you." I sniffed again. "Someone will pick you up soon. Packed and ready." @CAPS3 hung up. I'm sorry to tell @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed up and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon a car pulled into the driveway and honked its horn. It's @PERSON5, I say goodbye again and step into the cold wind and jump into @LOCATION1's car. "@CAPS4 don't you want to stay?" @PERSON5 asked calmly. "I don't know." It wasn't brought up until I walked in our front door. I already know my punishment and don't sleep somewhere for a few more weeks.
I had to be patient many times. I had to be patient when my @CAPS1 broke his eardrum, I was waiting for the X-rays, waiting to be on stage. These are times when I have to be patient. I was about five when my @CAPS1 broke his ear drum. I had to wait in the waiting room with my brother. It feels like forever. It was winter and I was in my pajamas and bored but worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade, my wrist hit a door and a wall. I've been in the ER for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, but they're doing a fantastic job there. My mom and I have been watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on their TV. It's cold in the waiting room and I have @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I am waiting to be on stage for my @NUM1 class concert. I was nervous and the neeves kept growing. I waited @NUM5 minutes but it feels like @NUM5 years. I sat next to my friend and it kind of helped. When we got on stage, I sang my heart out and I'm glad I waited. Sometimes I have to be @NUM7. I'm not good at being patient, but I waited and got good results.
Are you patient? I have, especially, a major time in my life. The main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have a baby. My dog's name is @CAPS1 mae and she is three years old and full of blood bulldogs. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . It all started when we brought @CAPS1 to @CAPS6 for early inspection. @CAPS6 said she was all right and pulled my mom aside. My heart is beating faster than ever because usually when they pull my parents aside I mean bad things. My mother screamed with joy. I ran to her and she screamed "@CAPS3 is having a baby" and I screamed with her. We went to get dixixe and then we took her to the bark game and she got her own steak for dinner that night. The next few months went by faster than ever. Well, at least it seems so. Now @CAPS1 is bigger. @CAPS6 says it will take at least 6 months to give birth to a puppy, mom says she has milk now, @DATE1. "I wouldn't doubt it," @DATE1 said, and we took @CAPS1 in for the night. The next day when I was getting ready for school, my mom said hey darling, I called @CAPS6 and he said he wouldn't be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppy today" and I said oh cool, But let's not hurry @CAPS1 She's going through a lot right now. "Then we said goodbye and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes an hour to get to school, but today it felt like thirty minutes. The days go by quickly. Before I knew I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said "oh you came at the right time dear @CAPS3 had her baby" We all ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 Lying on the blanket, I wrote down to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything would be fine. " I went in and got her a bowl of water and some soft food, and when I came back she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two, and then another hour for the other two. Turns out they both It's girls. Now we have eight dogs in our house. Mom @CAPS1 mae, @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cute, boots. Tinker, Bella, Harmony and Melanie. I love me dog!
On my birthday @DATE1. We don't want to go buy a cake. I ate an ice cream cake. More than @NUM1 people. I don't have cuy pashints. But my mom did it. Is this a playground night? ? ? it. So I don't want to go out and play. Wih my mom got it, she came and asked me to sell my povetg.
Patience pays off, @PERSON4 Brown Bear learned of @DATE1 while lining up to receive @PERSON1's autograph. He may be very upset, but he's just keeping his cool and looking forward to seeing @PERSON3. One day @PERSON4 saw the headline @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the paper. He put @NUM1 in the machine, opened the newspaper rack to the grad student, and it got stuck. He went to the gas station to tell people, but they weren't there, he rang the doorbell and no one came. @PERSON4 Try to be patient. He went to another store and bought newspapers there. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is his favorite star @PERSON2 will be in town. Can rush to town to eavesdrop and see the @NUM2 long line? ? ? . Excited to see @PERSON3. @PERSON4 queued at @TIME2, has been there for @NUM3 hours, she has only completed @NUM4 signatures. It's going to be a long day for @PERSON4. @PERSON4 got hot dogs and soda from sidewalle food business at @NUM5pm. @PERSON4 is still the last person in line and his patience has dropped a lot. There are only @NUM6 people at @TIME3, including him. He finally reached @PERSON3 at @TIME4 @PERSON3 and her staff informed @PERSON4 that he won the patience contest. They tell him they can meet her at the concert, get her phone number and win a date with her. He was happy, and he put himself through it for five hours. @PERSON4 is about to explode at @TIME1 and he knows he will never forget this moment. Also, @PERSON4 ended up being @PERSON3's boyfriend. That's when @PERSON4 learned that patience will pay off in the end.
While I am patient. They are when I have patience. They're getting @CAPS1 patients more and more when I'm not in a rush to do something. When I'm patient, I'll tell you a true story. I'm not in a hurry to finish it. My first day at school, we had a great time with a group of people and we had work on the first day. When we attended, some people were impatient. I look around the bright room and I'm thinking about how patient I should be, "@CAPS1 I said to myself" I have to take my time @CAPS1 I can achieve a good grade, @CAPS1 I'm patient. The next day, I was ready to see my grades on the job. I'm so happy, that was the day I was patient and took my time.
When I'm patient is when I go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I wait patiently for when to get on the roller coaster. An hour and a half. I wait patiently when I have to eat something. I am patient when I want to get on any rides. That's when I endure.
The time I was a patient was the last @DATE1. My friend @CAPS1 took me to Cedar Point in @LOCATION1. The place is very crowded and it takes five minutes from the car to the entrance. The place looked great when we entered! It's almost like a dream. They even take you by car from one part of the park to another. The first ride we did was @ORGANIZATION1. We waited, for about ten minutes, and then things got boring. It's been almost fifteen minutes and we're not even close to riding! So we waited, another ten minutes or so, and things got a little faster. In this part, the line moves faster. Finally it was our turn to get in the car. We have a yellow car and you can already feel the adrenaline. After we were tied up, the man who locked the seats said, "Go!" We took off like birds. In the end, it's worth the patience
Have you ever been a patient? Like in @CAPS1's office? Well, let me tell you I have a time. Once I got really sick and I started crying because I was in pain. I cried for an hour straight. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she worked. After getting out of the car, I somehow stopped crying. I told my mom I stopped crying but she told me I had to go see @CAPS1. When we went in, we saw this guy rushing to @LOCATION1. We went straight to the waiting room and all seats were taken. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out, she let a man in to see her and his son. This gave us two seats. About @CAPS2 minutes later she called us to the infirmary. She checked me out and I was really scared because I might have Normonia or a very serious virus. I was holding my mom's hand when she came out of her office. She came to us with a piece of paper and my mother asked me what I had. Luckily, she said I just had a cold and ear infection. My mom had to pay when we walked out of the ward. Does she just need to pay? @NUM1. We had to get medicine, so we walked to the elevator, to the first floor, and into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so packed, I felt like a pancake under a pancake. When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she took it along with a big lollipop. When I got home, I took some medicine and went to bed. The next day I woke up and about @TIME1 I was going to have a lollipop. That's when I have patience.
One day @CAPS1 ordered a dress with a pair of shoes and a ???. But when she ordered, they said I ???????????????? part is not clear it hasn't arrived yet? ? ? You can? ? ? ? Rossi said. "No thanks, I know??? Arrived" @CAPS1 said. For the next @NUM1 months, will this dress have? ? ? The magazine called and said, "We're sorry you're late for your dress," @CAPS3 We won't be charging any fees, thank you for your patience. @CAPS3 She ordered two more dresses and it arrived the next day, still happy.
I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and I complain about my own and others' difficulties. I play volleyball for school. There are a few girls on my team that have completely destroyed my patience. I'm sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. These girls are pretty good people, but volleyball is just for them? ? ? In fact, one of the girls didn't even try. She's even so upset that she's going to buy some practice sessions herself? Her attitude creeps me out. The other girl worked hard, but she was bored and controlling and thought she knew absolutely everything about volleyball. I think she made a hand? ? ? Playing volleyball over the years, she feels that she can play every time now. Rarely can she serve n cry loudly in the underground! This hot girl, my gosh, I don't even know where to start how much patience I have with her. She's probably the most trashy player on the team, and now that her pinky is broken, she's probably worse considering she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she was still part of the team, she went to all our games, predicted us and tried to be cool and failed miserably. It's actually kind of funny. Now, I know these girls practice hard, and I know it's not going to happen overnight. But I guess I just have to live with them and have a lot of patience.
Patience is hard for me. I'm just an impatient person. Patience is rare in my life, so I will describe a time when I was patient. "@CAPS1 You can get it this time." I encouraged myself. I store it online. The web is an obstacle. If the net is shorter, I can finish my volleyball serve. I balance the white ball in my palm. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, holding the ball high above my head. I reach forward. Wow! I hit the ball but it went into the net. "@CAPS2 @CAPS3" I thought. "You have this!" My entire team stared at me. Jingle, Jingle. I bounced the ball twice and spun it once in my hand. I don't even look at the crowd. I hit the ball with my hand. It flew over the net and hit the middle of the pitch. I achieved my goal thanks to my patience @NUM1 didn't give up. This taught me one thing. Patience brings victory.
Patience is something you have to work on. I don't have a lot of patience, and I don't like waiting at all, it's not fun. I don't like to wait because patience is boring and five @CAPS2 feels like twenty @CAPS2. Then, while you wait, you start doing something, and it starts right away when you start the time. Waiting for a package is the worst. You wait and wait and then you forget about it and then it comes. I was waiting to go to my friend's house one day and it felt like it had been forever since I saw her, but only about ten months. I missed her like crazy. We've been planning this" or weeks and finally the day of @CAPS1. Now I'm just waiting for my dad to drive me @CAPS1, he's taking forever. Finally we got in???? We waited five @CAPS2??? Then he got months??? and drove away. I swear we were shopping at every red light from my house to @CAPS3's house and got hit behind the slowest driver so it's more Oops. When we finally got @CAPS1, I jumped out of the truck and @PERSON1 ran past the door and tripped over almost every star. She almost jumped on me and we hugged five @CAPS2. This That's why I'm impatient.
My story is about when I was patient. One day I was super excited because it was @CAPS1 and my friends and I were messing around. I'm so impatient with the clock turning at @NUM1 pm because my best friend @DATE1 will pick me up in her pink convertible and we'll be tricking. I was impatient because it was only @NUM2 so I did my chores thinking time would fly so I did my chores. Instead of putting dish soap in the dishwasher. I put the grapes in the dishwasher @CAPS2 and the dish was done and I emptied it all smelled like grapes. So I looked at the clock and there was only @NUM3 and I remembered my favorite movie was playing so I ran to my room but I hit the wall and got knocked over. I'm fine in @NUM4 hours so I told my mom I'll be patient because I don't want to be bumped @CAPS3 ??? On the bright side I told myself I only have @NUM5 hours and @NUM6 minutes so I Went to my room + wasted some @CAPS3.V. Until eleven twenty so I had an hour to prepare to trick or treat, but first before I put on my makeup, I went into the kitchen and put all the grape-smelling dishes in the dishwasher and used Clean them the right way. Then I put on my costume, and I'm a bumblebee, and then I put on my makeup, and I look cool. Finally, the clock suddenly turns to @NUM1 and I hear the horn @DATE1 here. So I got in the car + we went to pick food. I almost forgot to tell you that @DATE1 is a ladybug and cate is a ladybug, so when are we trick-or-treating. So that's when I'm patient.
I remember, just a few days ago, my mom had to check her teeth and guess what I did, I read a book! Although it took a long time, I finished my homework in @NUM1 minutes. When my mom came back and we got up and left, my feet were the name. My patience has gotten us ice cream so far. So if you just wait patiently, you can be rewarded.
I must admit that sometimes I am not very patient. But I still remember what I learned that day about patience. I am NUM1 and I am going to the doctor's office for my annual checkup. Around @NUM2 o'clock on @DATE1 @TIME1. My mom and I were in the waiting room when an old man came in. He looked very sick and I remember being really scared. The ladies at the front desk came up to us and said to wait and @CAPS1 explained that the man was very sick and probably dying. I told me to be patient, but I didn't know what that meant, so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, "No matter how long it takes, you have to be quiet and not complain. I told her. I can do it, and I do. Patience is a very important thing to me .I feel like it's not just for myself, but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait, it's disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient with me, so I should be patient with them as well.
It's not hard to be patient if you try. This is @DATE1 @TIME1 I need help with my math homework but the teacher is helping others. So I waited? ? ? Five minutes passed and they still hadn't, so I decided to skip the question. Ten minutes passed and they weren't done, so I just waited and waited. And then they're finally done? ? ? Only two minutes. ? ? ? Well, I think I'll try again, and if I still don't get it, I'll ask her tomorrow. So when I was trying to figure it out it just didn't make sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said we don't have to do that and I told her with a smile? ? ? Figured it out yesterday. This is an example of patience
One day I stayed at my best friend's house for one night @NUM1 days and ended up going to school with her. Mind you, all my clothes and shoes are still above her house. I really can't get my clothes because I go out to eat after school. I was really pissed off because I lost my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 shoes so I called her and asked her to take them to school. I really wanted them the next day and I reassured her she said she forgot so I gave her until @DATE1 and she still hasn't returned them. Mind you, I'm very patient with her, it's the month of @DATE3. I finally got them back in the month of @DATE2. In the end she gave her support and you will never believe that I am still her friend because my shoes are old and dirty, but I have to realize that she is a good friend and I am a patient person.
The times when I have the patience are when I have to go to the eye doctor. I'm in a hurry because I'm late. This is @NUM1 and @CAPS1 dating at @TIME1. I am at least @NUM2 minutes away from this place. When we got there it was basically @NUM3 so I missed the @CAPS1 appointment. I had to wait a long time in the waiting room @CAPS1 Mom, I had to wait until all the appointments were done. We waited at least an hour and a half. While I'm patiently waiting, I talk on the phone and go online. In the end, I spent the rest of the day listening to music until they called @CAPS1's name. Anyway, this is when I have patience.
@LOCATION1 @CAPS10 Sit down, my friend said. You don't need to move around like a fly on the wall. "I sat down and was in a hurry to get up and move around." @CAPS1 Too many people here, we'll never get in. "I said. It's the longest line I've ever taken my driving test on, so @CAPS2 thinking about getting up and walking around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to walk around while I'm waiting, but my Friends thought it was annoying and embarrassing." @LOCATION1 I wonder if they have a vending machine here. "I doubt @CAPS1," I declared. @CAPS3 gave me one look, I turned away. I got up and walked away. I'm back @TIME1, @CAPS3 is gone. I sit down and call @CAPS13 @NUM1 I sit Watching everyone lingering and talking to who because I'm bored. I'd love to get up and walk around, but I'll watch @CAPS10 go around in circles, plus @CAPS4 leave. I'm sitting and waiting for @NUM2 @TIME1 In the past, @CAPS1 was getting closer to @NUM3.m. @CAPS1 was @CAPS5 @NUM4 and I was @NUM5 so I knew I was next.” @CAPS5 @NUM5 your next. "I thought "@CAPS6" in my head. I got up and walked to the cashier. "@CAPS7 your patience, now @CA PS12 can I help you?" "I looked at her and said, '@CAPS8 I want a driving test. "When I got my papers, I thought I was impatient because @CAPS1 looks like I've been there for countless hours. I think again @CAPS8 @CAPS11 I'm patient @CAPS1 may be @CAPS3 This makes I'm impatient because I don't have anyone to be with. So @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I @CAPS6 have been patient but I did @CAPS13 because I'm ready to leave." @CAPS12 waiting? Driver advertising teacher said. " @CAPS13 I feel patient enough to be there for about @NUM7 hours. This is when I don't know but I know I have enough patience."
Patience is waiting for something instead of complaining about it. When you have patience, you wait for something without complaining. If you're waiting for something and start complaining, it means you don't have much patience. Not being patient is really bad. Some people have no patience at all, and if they don't, it's not good. If you do have the patience it's good but some people don't it's not good because if you have to wait and it's important and you don't have the patience it can be a bad thing. Some people have great patience, but sometimes even if you have great patience, sometimes you can still complain. This is patience.
The time I had to attend was at the doctor tick-tock. The clock went round and round. Every time the doctors come out and start saying ABC's front and back yard is so boring, they didn't call me @CAPS1 @CAPS2 stuff. Finally called me after two hours
Oh, and when my mom and I were patient, we had to sit and wait for my mom to get her tag because it was her birthday. So it all started that morning, we woke up and had breakfast, took a shower, got dressed and did our hair. Brushing our teeth and buying them time for @NUM1, after we've done all this, we've lifted and then we've left in our mouths? ? ? and gain time. All have to @CAPS1 it's our @NUM2 and we're all hungry so we stop at? ? ? King, that is the day I must wait patiently.
Before, when I had to go to the doctor, I had to wait forty minutes. So I just played with my @CAPS1. I'm playing Mario Car. I got the board so I fell asleep. My mom woke me up because the time was up. So we went in and made my appointment and went home. Then we had to wait twenty minutes for my dad to come home from get off work.
Last month, I had to have a root canal. I am very nervous. I got to the dentist's office and was scared half to death by the pain, there were two people in front of me, so I had to wait, which made me even more scared. I should go to the dentist. I have always been patient. After I was done, I was fine and didn't even feel pain. When I got home, I fell asleep, although I woke up in pain and my teeth felt on fire. I never complained though, I never told my mom to hurry or cry when she wanted to hurry up on her meds. This is when I have patience.
This story is how I patiently waited for my birthday in three days. I've been patiently trying to see what I'll get for my birthday, even though it makes me sick! I'm also patient as I'm going to spend the night with all my good friends. It seems like it will go on forever. There will be cake and ice cream during my overnight stay! "@CAPS1!" I'm also patient because I'm twelve, which means I'll be patient. Then the day after my mom and I went to the mall and my brother and I went to the movies and I had a hundred dollars to play with. At the mall! It's hard to have the patience to do fun things. In the end, I patiently didn't ask everyone if they would come. Some girls forget to ask their parents and it annoys me because there are only two days left. This story shows how I patiently waited for my birthday in three days! But you have to be patient with the fun things I learned recently.
When I was little we went to @ORGANIZATION1. I can finally keep using the latest @CAPS1 @CAPS2! When we walked to the queue, we noticed how many people there were. The line looks like it's five miles long! My mom asked me if I wanted to continue the long line or go next time when it's less crowded. This is what I've been waiting for! I am not a chance. I told her I wanted to keep walking, so we kept walking. It took two days to reach the top. My mom and I are very patient! So we wait, wait, wait. until we finally got to the top. Then we came down. It was worth the wait! We are very patient. I will always remember all the fun and great achievements of that day. I never knew I could be so patient, my mom and I could wait so long.
Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I heard "@CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2." So I got up to check @NUM1 missed calls. I see who they are from @NUM2 of @CAPS6 dad. I feel something is wrong. I called him back and I heard "@CAPS1 ready, grandma @CAPS4 I'm here to pick you up." I said it was @NUM3 @CAPS5 Are you crazy? " That's when I was in a family member's house @CAPS8 @CAPS6 Dad said "@PERSON2 is obsessed. " @CAPS6 My heart is racing and I'm starting to cry." Pack your stuff and I'll call you back with more info. " I hung up @CAPS6 Auntie got up and she walked into the room and I told her I knew. I put together the @CAPS6 stuff and tried not to wake anyone else. While I was waiting for the call, everything went by @CAPS6 mind. I was with him, what happened, ok, is he going to die? @CAPS8 I heard the beep I said goodbye and ran out. Running made me think more: he hurts How serious is he, what car is he driving, what is he doing outside? I get in the car and ask @CAPS6 Grandma asks where is her mom, where is @LOCATION1, where is @CAPS7, how are they: when can I see him All I know has to be patience. @CAPS8 I got a call and I asked @CAPS6 Dad "what did he call, who's called @NUM4, where are we going?" ” @CAPS6 The first thing that came out of Dad’s mouth was “Calm down, I can’t go home, but @PERSON1 will be there, I want you to be with him, alright” yes Dad I will be with Dad “I Say "you" and he says back. I said 'I love you. "I love you too," he said. @CAPS6 The worst moment of my life is waiting for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 are @CAPS6 dads when @CAPS6 dads aren't home. I know I'll be fine with @PERSON1. What would it be like to see his best friend like this? @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are firefighters and I wonder if they know who helped @PERSON2. I know he's always by my side. Waiting is a must, but I must be patient. I remember closing @CAPS6's eyes hoping it was a dream. Now I'm walking into @PERSON1 right behind me walking I seem to have all the glass on him @CAPS8 dayna said look who's here they get really big when he opens his eyes and sees me. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 said @PERSON1 came here "@PERSON1 went. @PERSON2 said "Thank you for taking care of @CAPS6 little sister, I love you. " That was the time in @CAPS6's life and I had to patiently see bro @CAPS6. As long as he's ok, I don't care what he looks like.
I use this little patience a lot, which I call hunting patience. On @DATE1, my dad and I were hunting @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. We walked into our booth and baked on a @NUM1 yard bean field instead of @NUM2 hours later, two did walk in from our left and they were approaching @CAPS2. As I looked around, I was about to draw my bow and saw my dad waiting for @CAPS2 to shoot, but when I looked at the forest corner of our field, I saw a six-pointed buck standing motionless. I decided to wait patiently and see if the Bucks would come in. I saw my deer go into a blind spot I couldn't see, and I thought it might as well leave my blind spot like the buck last year. I waited @NUM3 minutes and just when I thought he was gone, I saw him coming to us again. It goes at @NUM4 then @NUM5 then @NUM6 and stops. I looked at my father and nodded for him to shoot. He stood below, withdrew his bow, and let the arrow fly. The arrow shot into the deer, and that moment I knew, because of patience, we'd have something good to eat tonight and a party to hone the good time hunting.
It was a sunny day and I was playing with my doe. Finally I finished my tower and it took an hour to fix. I started it in amazement. I am very proud of myself. I took out a toy doe and I made it "@CAPS1" and I put it on top of the tower. Well, my five minute amazement is coming to an end @CAPS2! I looked up and saw that my tower was destroyed. I looked in front of me and saw my neighbor and I told him why he did it and he said it was funny. I told him it was fun for you, but not for me. It took me an hour to get it done, which is a good thing I have patience. He looked down and said @CAPS3 sorry for what I did. I told him it was okay, it would be better if we rebuilt it, but better. He agreed and we both got to work. See how important patience is, the problem can get bigger. Finish.
Once in @NUM1 grade, my teacher @PERSON1 "asked us to come up with an AMP." @CAPS1 We all did, and we started working quietly. All of a sudden, I'm stuck in my last conundrum, and I'm thinking "man has come to the end". @CAPS1 I started working on it I was baffled by @CAPS1 this question is like a 7th grade job. @CAPS1 I raised my hand to continue @PERSON1 My hand told me to continue with my math, but I told her "I can't continue with my last question." @CAPS2 @PERSON1 Keep helping all the other students I've been waiting for. Finally, after she went to eight other people, she came to help me. She showed me how to fix this and I figured it out. That's when I wait patiently.
Well, one day I saw an ad on the awesome xbox @NUM1. The ad says it will be released in @NUM2 weeks. @NUM2 weeks "I thought this was going to last forever, so I waited, waited, waited. I glanced at the clock. It said @NUM4," I said, "@CAPS1 only took @NUM5 minutes. So I started playing the game , I forgot the xbox @NUM1. My dad said we're going shopping for my x-box. I thought, wow it flew by. I think if you don't think about it and wait patiently it'll be over soon.
One day, my sister participated in a volleyball game. It lasts all day. I just got there at the worst time and vigilance ??????????. I can't complain or I'll get in trouble, I just have to be patient. I'm very patient now because she has a lot of games. When did it finally end my mom usually? I have always been fine. As you can see, it's hard to be patient, but it's a very important quality.
This is my story about patience. I see a doctor every @NUM1 months. Me, my brother and sister, need about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. When the doctor asked my brother the question he said then I have figured out my answer and then it was my turn but before it was my turn @NUM4 sce Dr I was really patient. Then the doctor took NUM5 minutes to finish my turn. Then he had to talk to my mom about my time with lls. We are very patient when we treat doctors or dentists, but doctors or dentists need time to do what they need to do.
Once breaking my family on @DATE1, I went to @LOCATION1. When we were at @LOCATION1 we went to a huge water park. My two sisters and I persuaded my parents to go there. A few days later, we went to the water park. We rented a locker, changed our clothes and started looking for the waterslide. Just as we walked in, there was a huge (take away) shipwreck. Right at the deep end of the zipline! We all ran to the boat and found there was a line. Not a short line. A giant line. We must have been there for @NUM1 minutes. Finally it was my turn. I grabbed the handle and kicked the ground. When it slowed to a stop, I was almost at the end of it. I let go and fell into the pool. The wait is totally worth it!
"Patience is a virtue." If you don't like long waits, you'll probably hear this phrase a lot. This is a question for my audience, what is patience? do you know? Well, in my article, I will discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, it's hard to meet someone who is patient. With all the "@CAPS1" services and goods like pizza delivery @NUM1 minute washes and dty behavior, people are already starting to lose their patience. What our generation hasn't realized is that we need this kind of patience to get a good job and make a lot of money. Another reason people need patience is with their families. If you are impatient, you will not be able to deal with young and immature family members. For example, I don't have any patience, so I can't deal with anyone younger than @NUM1. This will have a very negative impact on me. These are the pros and cons of being patient, thank you for reading my article.
Once I was patient when I was a kid, my mom said we were going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to visit my cousins. I'm still a kid, so I'm excited to fly for the first time. I was so excited when we finally got to @LOCATION1. After arriving at the hotel I asked my mother if I could go swimming? She told me to be patient. So when we got to the hotel, I waited as patiently as I could, and then I couldn't wait any longer. So I put on my swimming trunks and went swimming with my cousin. That's when I'm patient with something.
I will write for a while I have the patience. My family and I went to Cedar Point. It is this ride known as @CAPS1 that is the best and tallest roller coaster at Cedar Point. So we had a long queue and we had to wait for @NUM1 to get on because the queue was so long. So I asked my uncle to get in the car and buy me some soda and elephant ears and some chips because I was hungry and thirsty. So while I was patient, the rest of my family wasn't very patient. I am the only patient. So @NUM2 in the past we were still in line and my family started making a fuss. @NUM3 hours go by and they're getting crazier. Then @NUM4 hours came and we started seeing roller coasters and people getting on and off. So finally, we got in the car and we enjoyed it. Then I had to explain how patient I was. How impatient they are.
One day, there was a man who had no patience at all. Everything he thinks he wants will come to him in the right way. His name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 was quick to think that not everything went as smoothly as he wanted. So when he saw there was a house for sale, he was really pissed off and it was a really beautiful house. But the people who live in the house haven't moved everything out of the house. Then he discovered that patience was key, and when it came time to move in, he would. So from that moment on, he has been patient for the rest of his life.
This is when I have patience. My birthday is @DATE1 @TIME1 and my family has @NUM1 boys. We all want to play Xbox. (@ORGANIZATION1.core @NUM2). Only @NUM3 controllers. So your current rules keep your geus without posts! all played? ? ? @NUM4 minutes! I have to? ? Minutes to play my own game! @MONTH1 all my ?? luckily I have patience. I hate sitting there, it pisses me off, and they didn't after a while? ? play.so I asked my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 if they would play? ? with me. They say yes after waiting @NUM5 minutes and then no one wants to play anymore. This makes me feel badly done! It's my birthday, can't you play a little? ? ? . I feel good, I am patient and not going to bisunck. This is my time to be patient.
The clock is ticking, waiting, ready, ready to burst into? ? ? . A @CAPS1 like never before, @NUM1 is planted on white @ORGANIZATION1, patience is key because with this @CAPS1 anyone who tries to defuse this @CAPS1, except for the last minute countdown to certain destruction, will Detonate it explosively. alpha @NUM2 @CAPS1 said waiting, waiting for the correct time. @NUM3 minutes, @NUM4 minutes, @NUM5 minutes, @NUM6 minutes. "@CAPS2, @CAPS2!" shouts , @PERSON1, leader of the rescued. This is our only chance to save the white @ORGANIZATION1. Time is running out, the @NUM7 second pole preggrare rides on our shoulders, and the fate of the white @ORGANIZATION1 is in our midst. The enemy was calling frantically, like all the grind was gone, "I get it! I exclaimed. All that's left??? Let the army do the job. We charged the van with shields and broke through. Fortifications. Suddenly we heard a loud noise, we noticed and rushed to the bottom of the van, we ran as fast as we could, our night gear van exploded to pieces behind us. We patiently waited for the patrol to pass. We just needed to Across the field to the army hetiepter was free to go home. We sprinted on the pitch and the victory was ours. A sense of accomplishment and greatness came over me.
It's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I'm watching TV waiting for @CAPS1 and I'm patient and not pouting because I want @LOCATION1 to come to my house, they're playing @CAPS1 TV and it's making me so excited and feel like my healing is about to explode , but I'm patient. Then my mom said it was time for bed, so I thought @LOCATION1 came to my house. But the only problem was that I couldn't sleep so I went and got a glass of water and then I quietly turned on the tv and turned on the acidifier and I fell asleep on the couch and next my new thing was @CAPS1 and it went so well Fast enough to feel like @CAPS1 in @NUM1 minutes. Because I have patience.
I've been patient many times, here are some. First of all, I am very patient with my friends. I'm very patient with him because we're going to school on foot. He told me one minute, but it was more like twenty minutes. We barely made it to the first hour. Another way I'm patient is when my mom and I go to @ORGANIZATION1 to buy my new shoes. While my mom and I were waiting for the store, the guy in the store went to get the shoes. It took the man half an hour to walk back. But it's worth it for my new shoes. These are just a few ways I am patient.
Patience is like waiting for something instead of panicking. Imagine if no one had the patience, everything would go bad. Imagine you have a long queue at the cashier at the store, you are impatient and people are fighting for it. Knowing that most people are patient, this is not going to happen. Since people are patient, the world has order, so if you think about it, that's a good thing.
When I have the patience is on the city bus. So that my mom and I can go to Walmart. We waited @NUM1 hours to get there. We had to pay @MONEY1 per person before we got in the car. Then nicely ask for a transfer. Then hop on another bus and get off to go shopping. Then wait until the bus comes back @NUM1 hours to go home. Then take the bus around the corner and walk back to the house.
Just before @DATE2 broke, in 4th grade, there was a @CAPS1 party at my neighbor's house. My parents and I both invited and since we had no plans, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There are socks hanging from the fireplace, green and red ribbons everywhere, and the huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room. According to @CAPS1 Tree, there are a whole bunch of gifts, each for the kids. My neighbor saw me staring at the gift, so he walked over, picked it up, and handed it to me. This is a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. In front is my tag name. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I wait until @CAPS1 opens it in the morning, I'll get two presents. I didn't understand it at first, but he said, I will soon. @CAPS1 it's been a week! How in the world is I want to wait? Of course, I wanted two presents, so I told my neighbors I'd wait. Deep down, though inside, I want to tear this right open. Days dragged on. Why is it so slow to pass a week? As @CAPS1 approached, I became impatient. I almost drove my first three days now @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unfolding it like I planned, I slowly opened the envelope...and found a golden boarder with a lovely velvet diary. Inside is a note: @CAPS7 Only you earn a new journal yourself, you now have the gift of patience. Now I understand.
This is my time to be patient. One day @DATE1 I was playing my @CAPS1 @NUM1 game and I told my mom I wanted a new game because mine was a bit old. My mom said "@CAPS3 darling be patient" and I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wants a curling machine that she got. So I've been waiting and I've been patient. My dad came back from @LOCATION1 and I asked him. I said, "Dad, can you give me a new @CAPS1 @NUM1 game?" "@CAPS3 darling, but I can't get it right now. You just have to be patient." "Well, okay!" Second Days I shouted out that my dad has got what my brother and sister wanted and I'm the only one of my dad and mom who hasn't gotten my game yet. So I waited, until Dad took me to the video store. Even though my sister and brother got what they wanted, I'm still happy. I still have my game. It's not hard to wait, it just takes patience. This is how patience can help you accomplish what you want.
To me, patience means that you are prepared to wait a long time to do something. I was a little patient when I was delayed and then cancelled at the airport, which wasn't very fun because I didn't eat the whole afternoon. But I am happy because I have my ds. The story is we went to Disneyland on @LOCATION1 on @NUM1. It was snowing when we arrived at the airport. We had to hurry through the inspection lines and security. When we got to the gate, we looked for where we had to board. I saw our flight was delayed and we had to stay at the airport. I at least see we're going to the new @LOCATION2 first, then @LOCATION1, but I'm being patient. That was the day I was very, very patient.
I am patiently waiting for @DATE1 @CAPS1 @DATE1 to attend. It's almost @DATE1 @CAPS1 @DATE1 I keep asking for gifts from @DATE1 but @DATE1 mom keeps saying no. It's getting closer and I've been asking until @DATE1 Mom said be patient and you'll get them don't worry, but of course I have a hard time being patient. Finally @DATE1, I can't wait, but I have to. @DATE1 I went to bed and I asked her again and again to say no. Here comes @DATE1, I'm off to school. I'm so happy because today is @DATE1 @DATE1, I got a gift from @DATE1, I got home, @DATE1 mom was waiting with cake and gift, she said "there's more". That's me trying to be patient.
@CAPS2 it was a dark sad night and we went to take the subway for my family. Boom, a bolt of lightning @CAPS1 everything went dark. The manger came out and everyone kept calm and using navy blue flashing lights, we couldn't get to our car because it was raining and thundering @CAPS2 we were afraid we would be shocked. So we waited to growl when my belly. "I'm hungry" so my grandmother and I asked if we could still make our subs because we had light. The butler said "OK". She told the workers to go back to work. @NUM1 mins later the manager starts handing out sub chips, sodas and cookies @CAPS2 is @NUM2 pm. We all ate and drank and felt asleep. The next morning, we all woke up to the sun. So we all walked into our car and it smelled like mince and meat. It was the most patient day of my life.
I ride a beautiful painted horse named @CAPS1 and she has one blue eye and one brown eye. She has it completely on one side and a brown patch on the other. @CAPS1 is a fat horse and she loves snacks! When I put pressure on her, she knew she was going to get the treat, but she had to wait for me to put the reins on her until she bit her and then she could get her treat. Since I'm a novice and make mistakes a lot, @CAPS1 has to be patient with me as I ride her. When I make a mistake or upset @CAPS1, she is patient most of the time. I tried my best, and so did @CAPS1, but I'm nowhere near the perfect rider, so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I were done riding, I unwrapped and brushed her, and after I was done, my trainer told me to give @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk through the long stall and patiently waited until I came back with her treat. Once she was done with her treat, I sent her to the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then ran over to her friend and had a glass of water, no more patience for now.
I had to be patient when we went to @LOCATION2. This is a @NUM1 hour flight with a two hour layover at @LOCATION1. It's really hard for me to be patient because I really want to go to @LOCATION2. In the middle of passing time, I listen to my ipod and use my macbook pro to go to facebook. It really helps me to be patient because it reminds me of @LOCATION2 we were at @LOCATION2 when we knew and when we arrived my patients were getting paid for swimming and partying on the beach I @LOCATION2 LOCATION2 breaks for @DATE1 @DATE2 That's my story, about when I was patient.
There are @NUM1 girls with a gay mom who takes them to a motel for their middle kid's birthday. It's all good units, mom and my mom @CAPS1 went out to buy gifts for @CAPS2, so this is the most important @CAPS3 middle @CAPS2 baby meme. Well, they left @CAPS4 and the motel girls. They came back later @NUM2. So then @CAPS1 walked back to pick us up and I noticed she wasn't in the van so when she told a guy cahty was in jail and we had no money I started crying no we don't have anyone right now so we have to go This gas station, my sister and I are sitting on the side of the road, and my mom crosses the road with a bus payphone. We had to wait patiently in the cold winter. Until the @NUM3 really nice ladies saw us sitting in the cold and cheered us up, for that gig I moved from Southport to Bangor.
The time I was patient was while I was waiting at the hospital. Once my grandma went to the hospital because she passed out and was not breathing. When we got to the hospital, we couldn't see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, uncles just sat and waited very patiently. When the next day came, we still couldn't see her, which was sad and scary. My uncle took us out to eat while my mom was in the hospital. When we got back to the hospital, my mom was upset because we couldn't see her at all. The doctor came out and said we could see her. She was sitting smiling when we entered the room. My mom told her it took us a long time to see you. My grandma Scud said it was no big deal. We were in the hospital for another @NUM1 hours and then we left but my mom stayed. Anyway, I told you when I had patients in the hospital. Even though we wanted to run in but we didn't, we stayed very calm. This is my time to be patient.
Patience is a good thing. Sometimes impatient @CAPS1 Sometimes patience is not good at all. My cousin is patient, so when I tell her to wait and be patient, she waits as long as she wants. My other colleagues told me to be patient, I would wait a while, I asked and hurry up, they told me to learn to be patient. My cousin tried to teach me how to be patient and we tried. So now I can be patient longer.
I'm in class waiting for my new news, it's coming soon. It's almost time, but I'm still waiting for the first class to be over. That's math. Personally, I'm not a big fan of math, so unfortunately I have to wait. @NUM1 minutes, I'm home. The time has come and I am very happy. @PERSON1 said "@CAPS1 your folder is gone" @CAPS2! I @CAPS1 its faster than supercal fraja list expeal & docinus I said. So then he said in his voice "you @MONTH1 go to lunch" I was in a hurry and I was going to be the first there I almost thought I wasn't patient enough but I was. I booked it there for free. When I realized a figure in front of me. "No" I said. I got beat by a girl! I'm frustrated, this is my story, and I'm sticking with it.
When most people think of patience, they think of waiting. But that's only half of it. Patience and no complaints, like when I went to @ORGANIZATION1. It's about a five hour drive. I know this doesn't seem like much, but I @CAPS1 hallway. I just @CAPS1 They are pure and simple. But my brother and I didn't complain, mostly because our mom's previous knight said two complaints were fine and sat with her in the hotel room all the time. It wasn't scary," so we finally went there. It was a fun week, we ate well, played sweet games, and didn't go to a bad museum. But on the way back, another test of patience , even more so because we were in a car accident.
On @DATE1 my dad was on a business trip at @CAPS1 dinsneyland. We got to the park and rode some rides. My dad had to go to a meeting, so he went. After a while I saw something cool, spaces @CAPS2. I saw a sign in line, @NUM1 hours until takeoff! My mom was shocked so we left. I am disappointed. We came back the next day and waited @NUM2 hours. We wait in line, wait, wait. @NUM3 minutes later I'm bored. I asked my mom if we could leave, but the line was too big to leave. A few hours later, we were on the front lines, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom and my sister were out of touch, but I stayed. I waited @NUM4 minutes by myself when I got on the roller coaster! It was fun, I got a fast for @NUM5 other rides! Ultimately, my patience paid off.
When my @CAPS1 came out, it was late @DATE1 and I was getting ready to use @CAPS2 points for my @CAPS1. So we drove there for a long time and just sat in the back and got back there alone with no one to talk to but my phone. So we finally got there, wasting all my patients in the car after we got in the car, we continued @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5 waiting for the ride @NUM1 minutes it was worth it, but still @NUM1 hours is a lot of time. So I'm in Wait, then we get off and they do @NUM5 rides on the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 lines. All rides there last at least 1-@NUM1 hours. Except taking the @CAPS7 we got there before the crowds came in. So it's at @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 the time we got on and at the top of the hill it's probably the @CAPS5 line. So we are really lucky. But when the @CAPS8 park was closed there was a huge traffic jam when we got in the car and that was all the patients leaving so we queued to leave the park for another @CAPS5 and a half so we waited and waited and finally it moved , once we walked through the park and out of the park the way we had to go was closed because of a car accident so we had to talk about this huge detoer it added an @CAPS5 to our time because of this traffic and @ CAPS8 When we got to our hotel, I didn't leave a drop of patients, I felt like I was going to blow up, but I didn't show great patience, but I have a lot of patients, which is a good thing.
When I was a patient, it was when I went to @CAPS1 with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friends @LOCATION1. We rode some of the rides and then @CAPS6 sister said, "Can we ride again at @CAPS2 @CAPS3?" I replied, "Yes, although this is our fifth ride. @CAPS6 sister and I went, in the station line. I said, "We should be in the front row. " @CAPS4 said: "We should. " @CAPS5 we went ahead and it's not going to work. @CAPS5 we waited 21 minutes, or @CAPS5 when someone threw another cart. The employees had to pack BARF and it was another 20 minutes. @CAPS5 we Been waiting, waiting for the UN until they let us on. After the ride, I exclaimed "who has a BARF like @CAPS7 a ride," @CAPS6 Dad replied, "I don't know. @ CAPS7 day is day, my rember @CAPS6 patience as I waited 40 to 60 minutes for the ride wasn't worth the wait. What was worth the wait was seeing the face on @CAPS6 sister, she smiled .
I know a lot of patient people and I have a lot of experience with patience. My friend @PERSON1 is usually impatient. Whenever she was waiting for something, she would text me and say, "@CAPS1!" Or, "@CAPS2 onnn!" @CAPS3 One day, she was actually very patient. My family @PERSON1 and I are going to the zoo @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We're going to pick up @PERSON1 from her house and @CAPS3 go to the zoo. But my mom slept and she had to take a shower! She said we'd pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 o'clock and it's already @NUM2 o'clock. We were late and I thought @PERSON1 would be pissed. Luckily, @PERSON1 wasn't mad! She understood and said it was okay. Usually, she'll say, "@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you procrastinating?" @CAPS5 time she doesn't say anything. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I've had experience with many patient people, and @CAPS5's experience has proven to be a lot of fun!
I think patience is waiting for what you want to happen or don't want to happen. Sometimes it hits unchecked. Especially at Cedar Point, you need a lot of patience. beep! beep! I rang my alarm with all my might, so I hoped it would go off. Butt @DATE1 I'm going to Cedar Point and I can't wait. So I got up and took a shower and had breakfast and it was great and my mom made blueberry puree. I got all my skinny bags a week early because I was so excited. I put my clothes in the car with my brothers, sisters, mom, dad so we can go faster. The drive wasn't that exciting because it was three hours but we had a TV in the car so it didn't take as long as it usually did because it was occupied so for my siblings it was like A shorter drive with me. When we got into the howtell, it felt great because it was as high as @NUM1 stories. And we also had to use the elevator to get to the room @NUM2 floor. My sister was amazed by all the plush toys and wanted to buy something plush, but she couldn't. My mom woke us up on the rides about @NUM3 minutes to get there. So I got out of bed and ran around like my butt was on fire, trying to find my clothes. So found all my clothes and ran around and put my shoes on the other side of the bed. So by the time we all got dressed and showered, the rides had been going for an hour, so we walked to the door and took a ride called "Million Care". Sighed @NUM4 hour wait sorry, due to seat belt difficulties and other technical difficulties, sorry, the ride has only just begun. So my mom said it was really fun to wait here for the bus. So waited and waited, I ran out of patience, I'll buy you a hot dog after this, so I did, and the ride was a great time @NUM1 hours in the park. It's fun, but we have to go tomorrow. I got my hot dog. This is my story of being patient at Cedar Point and you just want to have fun. Sometimes, you have to be patient to get what you want.
My family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 on a hot @DATE1 day. There is a new ride open called Shooting Rapids. It is a tall brown waterway with a tunnel and two hills. When we walked over to see how long the wait was, it said @NUM1 hour wait. We all wanted so badly to continue, so we decided to wait. It was about @NUM2 outside when we were in line and we were all sweating. To make matters worse, there was an annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. This is really annoying. We threw about halfway through when my nerves started to tick and I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and accept it. About @NUM3. Later we were @NUM4 guys away from riding. My heart was pounding and my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then suddenly it crashed. We had to wait for another @NUM5. As time passed, we finally got on the water rides. I regret. I was screaming and crying, but I was happy. I didn't hold back. That's when I had patience and regretted it.
I had to be very patient once when my grandma said something was in the mail for me. I am so excited. I waited and waited, but nothing came up. Then I started to get impatient. My grandma said "@CAPS1 keep waiting for it to come soon". So I did as my grandma said and a big bag came the next day. I'm glad it's finally here. My uncle sent me and all my sisters some new sneakers. Also, we all have @NUM1 players. I'm glad my patience has finally paid off.
I was in third grade @DATE1 the other day. My mom drove me to school and she said, "When I came to pick you up today, I was amazed what you would do." @CAPS1 I had to be patient that day, but I couldn't, I just had to go home and see what happened what. I could have gone home pretending to be sick, but I decided to calm down and be patient. I tell myself about school days. It will be over soon. Leaving school at @NUM1, my mom came to pick me up. I told her I was excited to see what she had in store for me, but I told her I was patient throughout the school day! Finally we got it, she told me to "go to my room" and I said "okay" when I went in I saw a little cute, black puppy begging me to be glad I had a dog soon! I said thank you mom thank you so much dad I ended up naming her chioe.
As a patient, sometimes doing a very hard and difficult thing, but we have to go throught it. Being a patient who is usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and my two brothers and I couldn't wait to go to @LOCATION1. We got to the airport thinking we'd get on the right plane. But when we got there we found we had to wait @NUM1 hours until the plane left and we were on our way to @LOCATION1. So we decided to get into our game and we brought us. We are very patient. Finally, it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long pipe to the door leading to the plane. We sat in our seats, buckled up, and we were ready to take off. We heard the pilot talk into the horn "I'm sorry, but no severe thunderstorm on radar, we @MONTH1 can't continue until it clears." @CAPS1! ? "How long does it take @CAPS2?" asked my mom". Five hours or so," she said. It's a good thing we brought our @CAPS3 players, so that's going to stop us for about two hours. For the rest of the time, play sleep and just wait patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we were very patient throughout the five hours, even my three year old brother, she would avenge our five @ORGANIZATION1 world pass for my family. In short, when you are patient, whatever @CAPS2 hard it is you will likely be rewarded, just like my family.
Patients are a great thing. It means understanding and calm. Sometimes people can take the hardship and pain and still keep calm. Anytime your brother or sister annoys you, be patient and never return a moment. "@CAPS1!" @CAPS2 is up! "@CAPS3 my brother." @CAPS4 I'm sober! "I yelled. I took a huge sip in the air and let it come out with a sigh. "I'm soo nurtured!" " My brother yelled in my face, 'We can @CAPS13 walk' I counted the past ten years in my head, then finally said '@CAPS7'. I got my coat off the back of the rack Little bro. When we saw my mom come to give mechoore our right to go outside. "You gotta mow the grass during the day and rak the leaves. " @CAPS5 calmly said, "@CAPS6 you go your little brother". "@CAPS7" I'm totally furious inside @CAPS12. I tried to keep calm, but it didn't last long, "@CAPS8 @CAPS9! " My brother and friend said with full cheers, "Can you come and play?" "@CAPS10 asked his brother to look up at me and I closed my eyes to break the habit." I stammered home. I grabbed the learning lawn mower right when I was about to turn it on @ CAPS12 - "@ CAPS11 , get in, start your homework. . ..." I counted silently. I walked away with a fake smile @CAPS12 my face. " @CAPS12 on the other hand...@CAPS13 take out the trash!" "One hundred and seventy-five...! Counting on and on. I ran downstairs to grab the trash and walked to the trash can because I gave up my coat inside age I tried Put myself in a happy place - @CAPS1! I speeded up in @CAPS24 the staring happened and it turned out my sister broke the tites of my X box @CAPS12 because @CAPS5 wanted to play. If it got counted in my brain I passed @ NUM1. I'm going to @CAPS15! I think. I'm holding my sister and giving her to my mom". @CAPS5 broke my X box! "I repeated '@CAPS17 @CAPS7, your DAT will fix it. "@CAPS5 calmly said '@CAPS19 @CAPS13 get your bros', "@CAPS4..." I paced down my bro's friend's house and told him I had to get my bro. "@CAPS7"... @CAPS22! @CAPS10 shouting "your bro got you here. " "@CAPS23! " I urged silence and patience, I managed. We walked home and I put my self @CAPS12 on my bed." @CAPS24 A borins day! "Me and myself." I don't think I ever intended to be this patient again in my life! I patted my head @CAPS12 pillow and said "@CAPS25 @CAPS26!" and went to bed. Wow! @CAPS24 one day! Patience means understanding and calm. Lots of patience. I have tried and learned a powerful lesson and always try. My life is way better @CAPS19 I try to be patient and never hit my siblings even if they get me @madnum2 sometimes. The @CAPS26 would be better if everyone just kept patient and people try to cheereed, it's a very, very famous phrase.
Be as patient as you are when you line up. Or like when you keep raising your hand and the tech keeps saying do your job, what you do, she'll say, if you do, you'll go to the dorm. That's when the teacher loses patience.
I write when I have patience. The time I have patience is in the first week of football. We went to the city to take the subway before the game and got a cub. I was the first in line, but then I was followed by other people, who chopped me at first, but then others followed me to be the last in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I got up and I got my sub. It has turkey, lettuce, pickles, bananas, peppers, cucumbers, and great French spinach. It regained something on that line, and the patience really paid off, and it's time for the back. It's been over @NUM1 minutes. I was relieved. We were excited for the first game, and even though we were tied, it was still a good day!
I was... After school, I was walking home with my friends from school. @CAPS3 knew I wanted something to eat @CAPS3 I told my friends to come in @LOCATION1 to take a break (it’s a fast food restaurant.) @CAPS1 We walked into the place where @LOCATION1 was crowded @CAPS3 I queued after about @ Waiting NUM1 minutes my friends said "@CAPS2 buddies let's go" @CAPS3 I said "I'll see you guys outside" "Okay" they said. About @NUM2 minutes later it was my turn to order, I ordered a double fries and some chips, because of my patience, I got a free milkshake, she asked @CAPS4 I said what kind of strawberry, I don't have to pay? ? ? Totally free, I went out and told my friends I got this for free and they said "oh oh oh" and that's when we got home.
I ordered a look collection online about @NUM1 weeks ago and I had to be very patient so it feels like @NUM2 years of waiting. This book series is not like any series of books @CAPS1 books are my favorites, they are called @LOCATION1 series. I have read this series @NUM1 times and am still reading them. However, I had to waste time to get them. I try to be patient, but it's hard. The mailing date is less than @NUM4 hours. I had to wait @NUM5 days before it came, and when I forgot about them, they came! Patience is a good quality one can have. So, if you're a patient, you might get what you want.
When I'm patient is my first @CAPS1 test this year. The exam wasn't too difficult, but it wasn't easy either. I finished it with about an hour and a half left. For an hour and a half, I had nothing to do but sat silently, not saying a word. Sitting down for five minutes is hard for a @NUM1 year old, imagine @NUM2 minutes! I fidgeted at first, then my neck started hurting so I put my head down. I closed my eyes and lay there quietly. Soon time has passed and @CAPS2.EAP is over (done for the day). I am very proud of my patience and calm during these @NUM2 minutes.
Hi, my name is @PERSON1 and I'm going to tell you a story about how patient I used to be. I remember when I was patient. It was a Christian day. There are tons and tons of anticipation under the tree. There are small ones all the way to the hamuges. But I can't even peek at them because my parents haven't woken up yet. I want to go to my mom and dad's room and wake them up. But not without breakfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can eat quickly so I can open up my vestibule. After Mom and Dad finished eating, I finally opened my presidential palace.
Patience is when you are forgiving and understanding. Many @CAPS4 have no patience, while others do. I'm kind of in the middle, but this is when I have to be very patient. It's a sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun is shining, as if there is no tomorrow. Too bad I can't play outside. I was busy resting, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It can give me bragging rights, I think I need some hope and patience.."@CAPS1" my brother shouted happily in my face. "@CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser, Lions win, Steelers lose," he added. "@CAPS4 is not happy and has a lot of time," I replied, with a worried look on my face. I'm afraid I'll loosen up, but I'm very patient with Brother Shen going in and out. The clock goes down. This is the presence of @DATE1. The score is @NUM1 to @NUM2 with the Lions ahead. I'm still a little worried, but I never lose hope. As the game drew to a close, @DATE1 backed me to do an awsorde pass for the steep slope, @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, "Who's the loser now, eh? Wow, all it takes is patience and hope" I told myself. Being a patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that my brother and I can be a little bit competitive, And if you just wait and tolerate what's going on around you, you'll be rewarded in the end!
I guess you could say that patience is one of my talents. I went through a lot of things that required patience and went through it without fear. Everyone knows to be patient with the church eserc ?????? Get on the bus? ? ? ? ? ? . You get up, then relax, then start, then sit down, @PERSON1 and ok! It's @CAPS1 forever. Boh so I know there are a lot of kids as patent as I am, some of them have @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 other lirastings to make them impatient and others just ???? you are. I know? ? ? Are people like that really numb? ? ? ? ? ? Can't be here yet? I know that wostoe nopele was struggling in school and I feel bad for them. Do you sometimes start to feel impatient when there are other people around? ? ? ? impatient. Worst of all I'm impatient with them and I'm frustrated because no matter what ???? ?? Sometimes I tell them to give it a try, have a pencil to stop whining, don't stop. I guess what I'm saying is that everyone is different, some are quiet, some are but, some peaks are habitual and some are academic. Patience is no different
There is a fish called @CAPS1. @CAPS6 lives around the @CAPS2 archipelago, which is a dangerous place for fish that can't slow down quickly. Luckily, @CAPS1 is the fabled many codscanths that do nothing but float slowly. Yesterday, @CAPS1 caught two fish for his wife. All the fish are in the desert today, which @CAPS1 absolutely despises. Using his patience, @CAPS6 waits for something to pop up. All of a sudden @CAPS6 sees a chunk of meat on something shiny. However, you can't catch it from too far away. @CAPS6 went home to find his wife. The next day, @CAPS6 went downstream and saw floating meat again. @CAPS6 swoops in and starts chewing when something stabs him. When @CAPS6 heard the snap, @CAPS1 started to yank. When @CAPS6 was pulled again, @CAPS6 fell into the current. @CAPS6 is finally free! @CAPS6 also realizes the current feel is very good. @CAPS6 slept after eating a few fish. When @CAPS6 woke up, @CAPS6 saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins. @CAPS1 couldn't breathe, @CAPS6 was in non-@CAPS6 and was killed by one of the other fish's fins.
In sports, you always need patience. Like if you're not shooting or someone is getting the best of you. If you are patient and will continue to work hard sooner or later, you will either complete these shots or make the most of the player. @PERSON1 has been very patient throughout his basketball career. He wasn't the biggest, fastest, strongest, or even the best at @PERSON2 high school where he was in high school, but he was patient. When he was @CAPS1 in high school, he played for the varsity team but didn't make it. He was very frustrated with himself and the coach because he felt like he should be on the team. His mother went to him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids @PERSON1 didn't give up or tell himself he wasn't good enough. He was patient and kept trying. All the hard work paid off as he formed the team the following year. He continues to @LOCATION1. There he won the championship with a winning goal. He went on to be selected by @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. @CAPS3 is one of the worst teams in @ORGANIZATION1. It took @PERSON1 a few years to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 Championship. In his first few seasons, @PERSON1 kept his cool and went on to win five titles. On his last @PERSON1 getting old, he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. @CAPS2 Tired though. They failed in the @NUM1 series. @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 keep pushing and keep fighting. Finally @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 Championship. @PERSON1 had some tough situations, but he was patient and played like an All-Star.
The day I was patient was at camp and I attended? ? Of course, the person in front of me? ? To go up like this, so I have to be patient. He was waiting on the platform when I got up and hit the first obstacle. I had to wait until they took him down. Then I finally got out when I was halfway through the barrier they told me I had to wait patiently for everyone to get off that platform. It took a few minutes, but then I'm finally leaving? ? ? That was the day I had to be patient
My mother is a very patient woman. She proved it by helping my brother @PERSON1 with his homework. @PERSON1 hates everything about doing homework. He hated doing math, reading, but most hated spelling. When my mom helped him with all three of those things, she showed patience, because since he hates all his homework, he doesn't always get it done without sitting down. When he did have a seizure, she was very patient with him and worked with him until he was done, which is the kind of patience my mom showed.
Wait to be the best. Music is pretty much my life, I love the way a song can make you feel, I love that walking a line on @ORGANIZATION1 can change your day. As a young musician all I can think of is music, I've been exposed to my @NUM1 instruments @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, the only instrument my family has that I can't play is the bass. So when my @ORGANIZATION2 went bankrupt, I made mr.groth realize he needed @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4 band. I studied the ass of learning bass art @ORGANIZATION1, read the clef and learned the musical notes, I was waiting for my rank to increase and memorize, I fell in love with this instrument in no time. I got better very quickly, and it seemed like I was getting better every week. I easily fell in love with the sound it made, I found I liked it more than @ORGANIZATION2, of course it takes time to be a pro, but I know it's worth it.
When I first saw my puppy @CAPS3 at @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 brought some dogs to be rescued @CAPS3 saw all six dogs the second I saw I knew he was going to be mine. So @CAPS3 let him out and the lady said he was scared and he gets motion sickness but I don't care he's my favorite. @CAPS3 said @CAPS3 wanted him so she told us to go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and told them @CAPS3 wanted @CAPS4 so @CAPS3 ran to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and on the way @CAPS3 thought of the name. My dad came up with @CAPS6 @CAPS3 loves it's name so it's his name I had to wait a whole week to bring him home but as long as I have my puppy I'm fine @CAPS3 give him one Toys @ CAPS3 Going back to see him, I've been through it every night, I know I'm getting closer to him and that day has finally come. @CAPS3 told my brother @CAPS3 to go fishing because he didn't know @CAPS3 was raising a dog. But one time @CAPS3 I ran in to see him @CAPS3 took him home and he was scared of everything and even left outside. But @CAPS7 he loves chasing leaves and playing with snow. Every night I tell @CAPS6 its bedtime and I sleep with my wonderful @ORGANIZATION1. Because if you want something bad enough, patience is key.
My dad has a girlfriend named @PERSON1. She has two children, seven and four. The oldest is @PERSON2, @CAPS1 loves to skate. The smallest one is @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 is kind of crap, if you jumped out of a plane, so would @CAPS1. Today @PERSON2 and I are going to skateboard in the park, @PERSON3 wants to come, but @CAPS1 doesn't even know how to ride a skateboard. @PERSON2 went to the park and when we got there @CAPS1 realized @CAPS1 didn't have his skateboard. I have to let him use my skateboard? ? ? ? ? ? I have no problem using it with him, I just don't use it.
I believe being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant and a patient person. Go through hardships without complaining. This story is about my patience with my brother. @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1. After about fifteen steps to the alarm, I measured another five minutes. I jumped out of bed thinking I was babysitting my little brother? ? ? I eat crispy? ? ? I thought as I tried to swallow the breakfast cores on my plate. I quickly took a shower and put on my jeans and T-shirt. @PERSON1 was about two years old at the time? ? ? Missed the service where he could walk. he is? ? ? It's hard for anyone to have patience with him because of all the spoilers he's created. But he's not cute and it's hard to be angry with him. When I hear cars coming into us? ? ? I know we met @CAPS3??? Walking into the house I walked to his aril where he sat? ? ? Let someone get it out and I dress him? ? ? And cute baby to him, I take him to the kitchen to do? ? ? ? The witch is much more useful than me. Crunchy and colorful. Under the lens? ? ? when we play outside. After the game, after playing with the car for a while, we had more dinner, and when we knew it was night, I let him sit in the tub and went and let him go, it came back? ? ? The whole bathroom was soaked with warm water when I was? ? ? Get dressed, @CAPS3 not in the faucet me? ? ? For him when I'm about to drink water? ? ? ? and helped him get it done.
I have always been a patient person in my life. An example is when I want to see @LOCATION1 rows where they are @CAPS1. I'm in the mall, from @LOCATION1's location all the way down the street. This is @NUM1 and my bedtime is @NUM2 so I have to hurry. My sister and I ran behind the line that my parents and I were in. They saved us a queue. After @NUM4, @NUM3 is all set, and the line doesn't even move. I'm so pissed. Every @NUM5 lines will move a little bit. As I was about to leave the ranks, I started to rise like a prosperous army. @CAPS2 when I started getting excited. I just want to ask him to give me an air gun and a pony. The reason is because I would shoot people who crossed my path on my pony. That will be life. @CAPS2 all the things I want to do. And I think @LOCATION1 will give me a good air gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. When I talk to my people, it's next. We went? ? ? . I asked him what I wanted and he said "you'll shoot your eyes out." @CAPS2 When I get mad because it has to be so patient. That was the last time I went to the mall @LOCATION1.
The time I was patient was when I was playing football and the defender hid the ball and I was waiting to get back. In the end my friend @PERSON1 intercepted the ball and the offense was on the field including me and then they let me run down the middle and I scored and then we passed a two-point conversion and it came but it was high and it Tilted up and then it fell straight into my hands and I got it but then I had to wait again because of the defense? Back, but halfway through. I was the shooter, and when I got the kick, we got the ball and passed it all the way back for touchdowns, which was really cool because my upper body was bleeding and I broke a lot of tackles. And then @DATE1 others? ? We kneel, it's mine in the end? ? swotted pass, if one? My team jumped up and we got the ball and then our full-backs passed the ball and made the game win and that's when I had to be patient
The definition of a patient is that when someone is in the car, and you're on a long trip, you don't ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you're going. An example of a patient is you're in a store and someone is in front of you and the kart is overloaded with stuff and you don't get mad at the guy called the patient. Also, if you're teaching someone something and they keep screwing up, you don't get mad and you keep trying to teach them, that's the patient. Another example of a patient is if someone has @CAPS1 and they have a hard time concentrating and you don't get frustrated with them, then you are patient with that person. Also, if the person just walks away and ignores you while you are still trying to teach them or show them some signs of a patient. Sometimes it's patients, because if you don't want to do the work of a therapist, you need a lot of patients. These are some definitions of a patient.
patience. What is patience? Patience is waiting peacefully for something. It's waiting for the right time to propose, or ask her out. Life is going to be tough unless you're a patient. You need to be patient when looking for a job.
This is an article about how patient I had to be to get a bowl of @CAPS1 @CAPS2. My grandparents just picked up my brother and I from home to go to Cold Rock for @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I've never been to Stone Cold but my friend said it was good. So I asked my grandparents if we could go. I am magnified. When we got to our destination, the queue was long. It is shaped like a snake. The sign said "@NUM1 minutes to wait." I was evicted. I saw it as I was leaving. Peanut Butter @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was staring at me in the face, so I talked to my grandparents and said we could stay. When we finally got to the top of the line, I ordered peanut butter @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Time to put my taste buds on vacation. Awesome @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It's so smooth. I'm thinking how happy I am to myself I'm so glad I sent out the amazing @CAPS1 @CAPS2. That's when I had to be patient to buy a fanomill @CAPS1 @CAPS2 bowl.
Patience means you are understanding and forgiving. A patient person encounters difficulties without complaining. I was patient for a while. Patience is hard to do @CAPS11 I've done it before. "@CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2, it's not moving at all." Brother @CAPS3 and @CAPS3 are clearly impatient. Hi @CAPS13 my mom I mean man, can you take a shower? "@CAPS4 I can if you want," a nice guy said to @CAPS5 in a friendly voice. @CAPS6, are you that stupid, I'm not really. I just cut you off for your stupidity. " @CAPS5 said, trying to be very tough. @CAPS5 is only a year older than me (@NUM1) and he thinks he's big and can do whatever he wants." @CAPS8, little guy, you can't cut me , I've been waiting in line. : That nice guy said to @CAPS5. "Okay, too bad." While the @CAPS3 bros were making eniesnes, patiently waiting in line even though the lines weren't really moving, in it I wanted to get everyone out @CAPS11 not like some I have patient and can wait. After the @CAPS3 brother cut that guy off and got no punishment, he decided to cut down hundreds. All of these people are pissed off, very very, very pissed at @CAPS5 @CAPS11, other than saying, "@CAPS8 don't hit me." @CAPS11 doesn't really help. Until @CAPS5 fired @CAPS15. That person is a beautiful young body with beautiful blue eyes and beautiful blonde hair and her name is @PERSON1 "@CAPS13 I'm a cop and this young boy just cuts us and everyone else." @PERSON1 Say. @CAPS5 was kicked out of the whole park while I waited patiently there '@CAPS15 Please line up," "@CAPS1 That's me... Won.Were" was the best roller coaster I've ever been on. Patience It's hard that @CAPS11 can be beneficial. I also learned that patience requires a lot of understanding and tolerance. Now, @CAPS16 knows you get the best when you're a patient. The worst is when you're not.
A kid at my school @PERSON1 has a crush on my best friend and my scumbag has been for a long time. He asked her about fifty times. She likes him as a friend, but that's about it. She has dated a lot of men since @PERSON1 first asked her out. Mycaela may be fascinated by a little boy. In fact, she is now dating a boy I dated two days ago, sorry for the topic. Anyway, @PERSON1 is always very patient and hopefully mycaela will show up one day. He has been following her for almost two years, and she still hasn't come back. I just think @PERSON1 is patient and a great kid.
I was patient once when my mom and my dad were on the phone for at least @NUM1 hours. We are driving on the way to @LOCATION1. @NUM2 hours I've been watching my dog in my lap. I was sleeping for the second hour. The third hour I was watching a movie and by this time it was really bad that I had to go to the bathroom. Then in the last hour of the half hour, I was about to cry, and when my mom put down the phone, we were already at my aunt's house. I ran straight into the bathroom and I was fine.
I'm @PERSON1 and I was a foster child a year ago. I have to be patient with a lot of things. First, my adoptive parents got divorced with their children. I had to wait patiently for my adoptive mother to find a home to move to. Second, I wasn't told when I could go home. I had to wait until everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom in a week. I packed up and waited. I have to be patient with everyone. It's hard, very hard, and the mind is going crazy. It took two weeks and one day to get home, and on top of that, I had to move all my stuff home and unpack it, which I am still unpacking to this day. Being a foster carer requires a lot of patience. I learned.
There's a new restaurant opening in town! He really wanted to go, so his family went. It opened @NUM1 minutes ago. They don't think there will be a line. They got there and didn't see any cars in the driveway. They crossed the driveway that started behind the restaurant. Then they say @NUM2 cars. He was really angry. They were about to leave and there were @NUM3 cars behind so they kept lining up. Since this is a new restriction, everyone picks food very slowly. They are also very slow to make food. Then people started yelling "@CAPS1 up" and they were honking their horns too, but he was the only one who didn't. They were there for @NUM2 minutes, @NUM1 has gone to @CAPS3. He was starving, but he was still very patient. He is usually impatient. He is excited to eat at the new restaurant. When it was his turn the cashier said: "@CAPS2 You are so patient." @CAPS3 It took them @NUM6 hours to get their food. The food wasn't even that good! He showed great patience that day. He didn't honk his car horn or yell. He's been in the car for @NUM6 hours and he's starving. Patience is a good thing.
This is a story about patience, and patience is when someone gives you an older or specific job to do. Then you finish work or order without @CAPS1, even though you didn't want to do it last week, my mom told me to clean out the living room, even knowing it was hard I still didn't do it. Even knowing I don't want to do it is unfair
Patience is a very important virtue. It's valued at least in these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you are impatient, no one wants to be your friend. You have to be patient with your friends or they won't be your friends. I came to this conclusion from experience. To be successful in life, you have to be patient. Whether it's waiting for a bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, this is always important. So, all in all, I think patience is a very, very important thing.
I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is impatient, you won't be able to wait for anything. An example is that you can't wait in line. The second reason I think patience is important is that without it, people complain every day because you use patience every day. An example is if you wait to buy a ticket or wait for gas, you have to wait your turn to get it. Finally, patience is important, because without patience you cannot read. This is because books sometimes take a while to read, and you don't want to take the time to finish it. That's why I think patience is important.
Once I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a great time while we were there. I continue to win prizes in competitions they run. I thought to myself "nothing will get in my way" Well, I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of tolerance. My level was low, but this time I was forgiving and calm. Saw this new ride when we were at the carnival. Everyone was lining up to see what was. While I was in line, I was ready to continue. Until someone walked up to me. That's when I started to get impatient. This will not be a good thing. I waited and waited as the line slowly moved up. It seems like an hour, but only @NUM1 minutes. People continue to walk ahead of me. As if they didn't see me, more people didn't see me either. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude thing. Just as I was about to say some rude words in my heart, I quickly held back. I remember trying to make my dad proud of me. So, when it was my turn to move on, I finally did a good thing. I'm proud that I didn't say anything. After the ride, I quickly went to my father. I am proud of my tolerance. The person walking in front of me was not bad. Looks like I can do something positive. If they thought they would find me, they were right. But if I'm going to say something, they're wrong.
Every day I have to be patient with difficult things. I have to be most patient when I'm playing or watching sports. Every time I nerf my brother is playing a football league, which might raise alarms. I had to bite for nearly two hours to finish the race, and my parents put me in the race. My favorite speed is football because I'm first baseman and where to eat; I'm going to wait for the ball to arrive? ? ? So I can help the team. I also had to be patient during the meal because it was so long and I had to wait until people were done eating. As you can see, I am very patient and have to be in a lot of situations.
It was terribly cold and all I could do was wait, wait, wait. What I'm waiting for is @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I have friends with me, but they mostly talk to themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blonde hair brushed across her face, @CAPS7 turned her back to the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, as the one with the leash, stumbles to the side. "Are you sure you don't want me to take him?" I asked Tooth Time. "@CAPS4, I get it!" @CAPS7 said happily. I was cold and hungry and hungry, but at least my arm wasn't ripped off. "Are you sure?" I feel bad, @LOCATION1 is my dog and I should be holding it. This is a simple task for @CAPS4. "@CAPS5!" @CAPS7 said flatly: "I get it!" @LOCATION1 pulled her again and @CAPS7 fell into me. I caught her and @CAPS7 mumbles sorry. I have, but I still think I should take him. I've been complaining all day. I'm partly joking about our luck, but mostly I just want to start a conversation. "I think my hands are numb," I said, putting them in my pockets. "@CAPS6, at least it's not raining, like the weatherman said," @CAPS7 laughed, and so did I. A voice came out of the blob, "@CAPS8 Pacers. Let's move!" I glared at @PERSON1 and asked again: "Do you want me to take him!" @CAPS7 patted me on the back, slowly Said, "I see."
The one time I had patience was when I had to make a baby for my little cousin. He's just a little baby, so I know if he starts crying, or gets frustrated with him because he's a baby. Sometimes he starts crying for no reason and I just want to scream, @CAPS1, I know I can't, I just need to be patient with him. I also know I can't be mad or pissed off because it might make him worse, so I have to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and let me calm down before I can get close to him. I am understanding and tolerant, and I have not lost patience. It is very important to practice this skill. I'm proud of myself and able to keep my composure in this crazy or chaotic situation and not lose my composure or patience with him or anyone else.
Ugh, what keeps PE teacher @CAPS14 for so long? @PERSON1 complained. "@CAPS1 it's been a few hours" "@CAPS1 just @NUM1 minutes." @PERSON2 said. "@CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS1 feels like hours have passed." @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS4, you just need a little patience." @CAPS5 explained. "@CAPS6" said @PERSON1. "@CAPS7 you sit here and let your @CAPS14 call patience and I @CAPS8 will put my bag on stage." @CAPS9 @PERSON1 got up and everyone tried to tell him to sit but he did just ignore them. "@CAPS10' man just sit down and be patient" @PERSON2 said "@CAPS11 I've been waiting so long, I'm bored, I'm tired, my feet hurt!" @PERSON1 shouts @CAPS9 he's walking behind the stage. "@CAPS12 is going to be in trouble," @PERSON2 said, looking down. "@CAPS13 is just shouting:" the PE teacher shouted angrily. The PE teacher looks to the right and sees @PERSON1 behind the stage saying, "@CAPS12 can't play basketball, but @PERSON1 screwed up @CAPS1." @CAPS14 nobody plays because @PERSON1 has no patience. @CAPS14 I wish he was a little more patient today.
I woke up before school started, picked up all my stuff and walked out. When I got to school, I started hanging out with my friends and had a great day so far. Around @NUM1 o'clock, @NUM2 hours are over and we're off to lunch. I wasn't hungry, I wanted to go with my friend @CAPS1, she wanted something to eat, so I waited for her and we went out. When we go out, we like to do back walks, handstands, backbends, front hand springs, cartwheels and stuff like that. I'm not feeling well, I'm hungry after the clock strikes @NUM3 hours. I just wanted to go home to eat something but we still had to wait until the recourse was over and then we had to take the bus for about an hour. When I finally got home, I wasn't feeling well, my dad asked me what was wrong, I told him I was hungry, it was about @NUM4, and he said we have to wait until mom comes home my mom comes home at @TIME1. I had to wait and be patient for @NUM5 hours and I realized the wait was ok because it was a delicious dinner and if I had something else before dinner I probably wouldn't have any dinner if I I probably won't eat anything else before dinner if I can. That's a story with @NUM6 examples and I'll have to be patient.
I don't have the patience many times, but I'm going to tell you when I do. The one time I had the patience was on the bus home. My bus driver @PERSON1 put me in the back because she was talking too much about me and I didn't speak out loud the whole way home. It was hard at first, but then I did my homework. This gives me something to do. That was the one time I was patient, but not the only time. Another time, when I had the patience, I lined up at the Cedar Paint Station for a roller coaster ride. The beginning of the line says it's a @NUM1 hour wait, but we don't care because it's my friend's and my favorite ride, not bad because it's all worth it when you ride. I was patient those times, but I had to wait patiently longer!
Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is when I'm patiently waiting to go to a friend's house. Savannah Dad was a firefighter and he had to put out the fire and didn't come to pick me up until the next afternoon. I am very sad. It was in the middle of @DATE2 and I haven't seen the prairie in @NUM1 months. I learned that day that patience is a way of life that people have to live with, and this is when I had to.
I was standing in the sun at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @DATE1. I could feel sweat dripping down my face. I look ahead, there are at least two hours left to queue for the roller coaster. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @CAPS7 keep silent because they get irritable. Suddenly this guy screamed, "@CAPS6 up!" The @CAPS7 queue started screaming at each other except me. I don't want to yell because it makes @CAPS7 work more. After an hour, everyone calmed down. Then I look forward. @CAPS10 almost up front. I wiped my face and smiled. Then I said, "@CAPS8 hoo!" @CAPS7 looked at me like I was from another planet. mine? ? "What?" my mother asked. "@CAPS10 is almost there!" I replied. Then @CAPS10 is on the road next. When @CAPS10 got into the ride, I fixed the seat. The next journey takes off! The breeze blows across my face and it feels good. At the end of the ride, I said, "I know the patient: it will pay off." That's when I had to have the patient.
It was hot and there had been an hour in line, "When can we go?" I asked in a whimpering voice. My parents replied, "Be patient, it's almost all up front." @CAPS1, that? ? ? what did I do. my body? ? ? It hurts to walk around all day, but that doesn't stop me from taking all these rides. After another ten minutes, I started to get thirsty. My @CAPS3 and my sister wanted to join me for a drink while my mom lined up with our s??t. We got to the booth. "I'm going to fetch water" I said, ? ? ? Achieved. I said thank you and took the cold water from him. As we all started walking back to the line, I spotted a brightly colored shirt that read: "@CAPS2. I couldn't help but ask, "@CAPS3, can I buy this shirt? " If we go back, we'll still have to wait longer." @CAPS4 he responded, but let's hurry @CAPS1, your mom won't be impatient. After I got my shirt, we walked back to the line. Thank goodness we are second. All in the mummy car. ' explained the man who controlled the ride. We kept going and the patience paid off because I had a feeling this ride was going to be great.
''@CAPS1'' My name is @CAPS2 ?? This is a story about my patience. Once when I was eight, my mother said she would take me to the market that day. So after lunch we went on a rainy day and I wanted to ride the biggest bike there so we had to wait in line? ? The lines are long so I have to be patient. I didn't want to queue so I was complaining about half the time, but the queue wasn't that long and I had to be patient. I'm glad I'm patient because the ride is? fun. I was walking that day, it's good to be patient. I told me? ? I will never be impatient again. Is the story like this? ? How long do I have to be patient with them? ?
Patience is a good thing. Let me tell you my patience once. Once I have a dentist appointment is @NUM1 am and my appointment is @NUM2 am. Me and my dad sat and waited until @NUM2. it's painful. I don't have anything '@CAPS1 to do. I don't @CAPS1 read magazines, they don't @CAPS1 have @CAPS1.V or anything. I'm really hungry because I don't have '@CAPS1 for breakfast. @NUM4 am still waiting. I can't '@CAPS1 do that. It was so boring until I remembered that I had a @CAPS2 @CAPS3.S in my pocket. So I took it out and started playing. time flies. That's when I'm patient.
This thing about patience mostly tells you about time, me and you, about when I was patient and how I made myself patient. One day my dad and I tried to wait for a transfer at the hospital and we had to sit in the waiting room @CAPS2 @NUM1 hours. I wonder why I kept waiting for @CAPS2 and doing it myself. Well, things keep telling us to wait @NUM1 hours. Anyway, I got hurt and I stopped next to my chest for 2 hours and then I touched my chest and it looked sure as he rode @CAPS1. Then after that, when we counted @CAPS2 @NUM3 minute loop tiles, I noticed that I remembered them over @NUM4 tiles. Can climb I haven't complained at least yet. I played @CAPS2 with my dad after I counted the loops, I won, we ate @NUM5 minutes @CAPS2, the rest of the time I played @CAPS3. I played @ORGANIZATION1 and games. I was me for a while and then I did. @NUM6 Time to go home again, my dad is hopelessly tired. I didn't complain once, that's when I was patient.
Patience is really the hardest thing and body really? that one? . It's hard for me to be punished for not doing what I should. So I have to be patient until I'm patient, which is what a perfect team should do. From my pop it how. So when I get punished I just wait for it to end so my time will come because I can't be there to speed up and succeed? ? ? Faster, but I can, but now I have to. I have it for a long time so I can be patient. I know before trying, but most people have to do it because rush is probably not the way to do it. Patience also helps the maker and cam save you time. Patience is also a good thing, because for sure you want things like; money, clothes, shoes, house, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, cars (traffic and emergencies, because when you post, you Everything you want will come as you expect, but wait and be patient to get what you want and the look you want!
As I sit in the waiting room at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting for my grandpa to come to your recovery room. I thought to myself, what if something went wrong, or if he didn't go through the operation. Then I said to my @CAPS3 "can we see grandpa now" and she said "@CAPS4 be patient, if you sit back and relax, everything will be fine," "be patient!" "@CAPS5" me Say it to my @CAPS3. An hour passed and I started talking, so I thought to myself: Callum and patience, calm and patience. Then the lady came out to the waiting room and said "the surgery took a little longer than we expected, but everything went well, but he'll be in the hospital for a week and a half at most" which was fine for me as long as I left this boring Hospital, as soon as I say I let my mom say, as soon as Grandpa gets to the recovery room, we'll see him, and then we'll leave!
As I waited in the car for @LOCATION2, I had patience. About @NUM1 hours from my house to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. So I had to sit in the car for @NUM1 hours. The only thing to do is listen to your ipod and sleep. I didn't do either of those things. As you know, waiting @NUM1 hours in a car takes a lot of patience. An hour has passed and it feels like @NUM4 if you do nothing. By that time, I was ready for a fight with my sleeping sister. I know I can't do that. Now is the time to think about doing something. I took out my phone and started texting people, but no one answered. I tried looking out the window, but it made me sleepy. It took too long to get there. Finally @NUM1 hours passed and we arrived at @LOCATION2. This is when I have patience
I left, to be exact, I went to on rama. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 saw a ton of cool old cars and @CAPS1 saw some old cars too. Some cars are old and rusted, some are new and state-of-the-art. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 see a flag. Read it to see the chips! So @CAPS1 went and looked around. "@CAPS1 found him! I exclaimed. "@CAPS2" @CAPS8 bro shouted." @CAPS3 Yes! "@CAPS4 @CAPS1 went over and looked at the end of the line. It's @CAPS5! So @CAPS1 wants to die in half an hour. @CAPS1 is so wrong. It's @CAPS5! Big so @CAPS1 had to wait, wait, wait. @CAPS8 dude got to where he could run a mile and if he didn't he'd have a blast. So I had to walk around with him. I'm back on my feet because standing around doing nothing for @NUM1 hours is really boring. I've gotten to the point where I have to get up and walk around or I'll fall asleep. So I went for a walk with him. @CAPS1 back Yes, I sat down again @CAPS1 Waited, waited, waited and waited. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 heard the stop! These people behind @CAPS6, have to go back after the break." @CAPS7 Security. @CAPS1 is the last person. The people in front of us are a lifeless nerdy couple. @CAPS8 bro started crying because he didn't get the fool's autograph. Kind nerdy couple @CAPS7 "Here's our spat @CAPS1 all day, you @CAPS2 like you really want this autograph." @CAPS8 brother replies "Smell @CAPS9 won't it!!" @CAPS1 at 51 Got it after /@NUM1 hours of waiting, waiting, waiting and dying. That's when I had to be patient.
Patients are those who have been injured in the same way and are trying or getting better in the hospital. I used to be a patient because I was sick for a long time so my mom went to the hospital and I got shot. On our way out of the hospital, I passed out and hit my jaw against the door, so we had to stay for about an hour. That was the only time I was a patient in a hospital.
I was patient yesterday while watching the movie @CAPS1 at home. So I waited a long time until the food was ready, he? ? I was so intrigued by the movie that I couldn't watch it because it was so good until I was really hungry and then I ate the second plate after the second plate and I didn't get to eat me leftover food. And I didn't complain that I was hungry.
Patience is when one person may be busy, it is best to be patient while the other is done. I'm going to write about a time when someone I know has patience. One morning, when my mom came over from get off work, I told her that I really wanted to visit my friend's house. But my mom kept saying to wait, so I had to wait, so I did? My mom wasn't done, so I told her if I could go to work at my friend's house. But she said no, I have to wait patiently for her to finish. My dad is busy with work in the afternoon, so I am free. I told my dad that if he could drop me off my friend's house, then he could keep working. So I did and I went and told him. But guess what he said because he was late and I looked at the time and yes he was late so I decided to be patient because my mom was almost done and my dad was gone so I just sat down Watch TV when my mom is done. My mom came into the room so I stood up and asked her if she was done and she said "yes" I went and my mom had left and that was the day I went to my friend's house just to be patient.
I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait. For example, daily tasks such as standing in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, and waiting for your doctor to examine you require patience. I need patience @NUM1 times almost every day. First, I need to be patient while my mom drives me to school. I also had to wait patiently for classwork to end, class to end, lunch to start, night to come, etc. I hear people say patience is a virtue. I don't even know what that means, but if I'm patient I might find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, people are using it every day. I think patience is a gift and I love it.
On @DATE2 I understand what my mom said to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 that she can't get anything from @CAPS1 for @CAPS2 because she has to pay the bills. She thought she didn't do a lot for @CAPS1 and I told her I was fine with what I got. I just want to be with her @CAPS2 but she doesn't understand that she's doing so well on her own that my dad didn't help her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids, but she and the @NUM2 kids in them all sizzle. But my dad always said I knew if he had it, he would give @CAPS1. But as @CAPS1 I don't want to listen to him because it's all lies. My mom had to find two jobs to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came, @DATE1 everything was fine, my grandma passed away. My mom, aunt and uncle @PERSON1 all have to make money for everything here, she looks beautiful and it's all over but know we still cry about her. That's when I'm impatient because it's hard to imagine she's gone. So my mom and they all told @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand that she is in a better place with some of her lovers. But to this day, I can't understand what someone means when they say they're gone. But @CAPS6 forgot.
When I am patient. We were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1 one day. Our tour just assumed we only had three cars on our itinerary, but one of the cars following us was stopped by something cutting a tire. We had an hour wait before they fixed the tires and caught up with us. They also have to pass traffic and long traffic lights. We waited at the gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the bathroom for fifteen minutes, and the bathroom was so dirty, it took a minute to get them dressed for a rainy day. There are five or six people in three carriages, which is time-consuming. When we were done, we went back to each car and back on the road to @ORGANIZATION1. We passed all the king signs that said "@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1" and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and of course when we got there I saw this huge digital sign playing music that said "@CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1"! We are finally here! We were so excited and had the time of our lives! ! ! By unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong
"@PERSON1 let's take this line for a long time!" "@CAPS1 @PERSON2 Please be patient!" "@CAPS2?" @PERSON2 asked, "@CAPS3 @NUM1 replied." @CAPS4 @CAPS2? " Have you never heard of a patient?" " @CAPS1" "@CAPS6, are you trying to tell me that in 13 years, have you never heard of a patient?" " @CAPS1" "@CAPS6 Are you trying to tell me you've never heard of patience in thirteen years?" " @CAPS9" @PERSON2 dubious answer. "@CAPS10 @CAPS12 When is a good patient." Wow, I never knew patience would be so hard to explain @CAPS6. " @CAPS11 Now you see why I didn't!" " "I see!" "He shouts, fingering. @CAPS16 a guy in line is staring at them. There's blushing. But @PERSON1 ignores that fact and says: "@CAPS12 @CAPS6 Patience is like when you wait Long time but you don't care about waiting long and finally get what you want because you @CAPS20 patiently. " @CAPS6 @PERSON1 & @PERSON2 @CAPS20 & @CAPS20 & @CAPS20 aligned. Soon @CAPS21 they're up." @CAPS14 Tickets @CAPS15 @CAPS16 Where I look: @PERSON1 & @PERSON2 excitedly. "@CAPS17 Well, wait for me to open a new pack of tickets," the guy at the ticket booth told them. @PERSON2 glared at @PERSON1 and said, "@CAPS12 @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21: @CAPS19 @CAPS20 waited 20 minutes on this line, now am I going to wait any longer?" @CAPS23 go, kids , that's $14 @CAPS. Embarrassed by @PERSON2, but glad he got the ticket, @PERSON1 said: "@CAPS11 you @CAPS20 got what you wanted, which is patience. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 sat in the cinema and watched a great movie. If they don't have the patience, they'll never see @CAPS11 their new favorite movie!
Patience is a key role in life. If you are impatient, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life requires patience. If you're impatient, if you're impatient with your boss or coworkers, you're likely to annoy your work. I often have a hard time being patient with my parents. Sometimes I just can't stand my parents, I lose my temper and get impatient with them, which usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother, but he can be annoying, like most little siblings. When my brother made me nervous, I became very impatient with him. Sometimes I get really angry and impatient with him, I lose it, I always get in trouble when I beat him, I always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I'm older, I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes people's lives easier and more fun. I'm around every day, which is why when you're patient, you get what you want, but when you're impatient because you're trying to get your way, it never happens.
The time when I am patient is when my friends come over and I get excited. But I waited and waited. But she found @CAPS1. That's it.
I was so patient, I had to wait for my grandpa in the emergency room. For his Hart, my grandpa was in and out because he didn't do a good job. For my grandpa's daily heat, my grandpa has to go and see if he decides to throw his heart out, that's why I wait patiently.
Patience is something you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I am patient every day at school. Be patient with my teacher. I have a lot of patience with kids at school who like to take pictures of other people and make fun of them. Some days I have patients, and some days it means something is wrong, which means I don't have any more patients. I love having patients because it makes you relax and everything. A patient is a good thing you can have. I think patents can prolong your life. A lot of people in the world don't have that many patients, and I think that shortens your life. I don't think if I didn't have any patients I wouldn't be going to school now because some kids just have problems, they don't have problems, they have bad grades, etc.
In this narrative piece, I'll be writing about @NUM1 different times, and I'll have to be patient. Such as waiting for school on vacation. I can't get my game when I have to wait until my mom wakes up to go to the mall. The other thing I have to wait for is to get my final, like in??? All these times I have to understand. One day, I would love to leave school on Friday. To make it bad, the snaps are monotonous, and I have a planned schedule of my thinking days. I can stare at Abarth as one thought passes there like another and it changes. I was about to call home, but @CAPS1.A saved me. I have to understand that moment. Another time I had to understand that I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall. Look what happened, last year I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 in the report and a new game is coming so I want it. My mom fell asleep and it was almost impossible to wake her because she had gone to the club the night before. That's when I had to be patient.
I'm working on my comic book right now and I haven't started drawing it yet. This is a major scene in @NUM1's book. "@CAPS1, @LOCATION1, are we there yet?" @CAPS2 asked curiously "@CAPS3. Not yet" @PERSON1 replied with fear in his voice. They were lost, really lost. "Are we there yet?" Little @CAPS2 asked again. "@CAPS3, @CAPS2, you just have to be patient," @ORGANIZATION1 said, quickly getting pissed. So walked for a few hours, but still @CAPS3 Castle sign. Little @CAPS2 was delighted to meet the Queen as she once imagined the Queen as a kind, patient, beautiful woman. @ORGANIZATION1 can @CAPS9 say @CAPS2 is tired, put her on her shoulders and she says @CAPS2, "@CAPS9 if you can @CAPS9 @CAPS2 castle from here." @CAPS11 waited a few minutes, @CAPS2 finally saw it Castle "I @CAPS9 it, I @CAPS9 it!" she laughed. She jumped off the shoulders of @ORGANIZATION1 and ran down the narrow path. Because she had been waiting, she was as excited as ever. Not only because she found the castle, but because she learned how to be patient.
When I'm patient is when I put my braces on. I'm nervous, so it's hard to be patient. I waited about fifteen minutes before the assistant called me in. First she told me what she was going to do, then she took x-rays of my teeth, third she glued metal glue behind my teeth with very strong glue, and fourth @PERSON1 used very strong glue Glue the brackets on top. Then the assistant put the wire between the stand and the metal hand, and finally she asked me what color I wanted, and she put them on and I was off. The whole process took two hours and I had to sit in the dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience and it was hard but I did it. That's when I have patience.
"So @CAPS1 do you want your @DATE1?" "A @NUM1" "@CAPS1 what more do you want?" @NUM1" I've been wanting a game station @NUM3 for so long. This is my tenth Three times @DATE1 I never wanted more. All my friends have. Whenever I go to their house we play around the clock. I want one...I want a real dad. The only exception is that it cost @MONEY1 and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party which adds up to @MONEY3 @DATE1. So my mom and I decided to make a deal @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 and she will pay the other half. Since that day I've asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I don't want any other gifts, I'm staring at the prizes. So usually you have a family reunion and all the relatives come over to give you gifts and celebrations. I know That's where I got my @MONEY4. Everything seems to be perfect, I have it planned. Have a family reunion a few days after @DATE1 and go get my @NUM1! I don't mind waiting two or three days. I think I Will live. "Hey mom, when are we having a family reunion? " "@DATE2. " @CAPS2 At that moment steam came out of my ears and I could feel my face burning like I put my head in the fire. You @MONTH1 didn't realize that @DATE2 is a full month away from my @DATE1 .@CAPS3 impatient waiting for @NUM5 days, then I don't know @CAPS1. I haven't got my @NUM1 from today, but in two days I'll have a pile of cash in my hand and head to the top of the players: @ CAPS3 I have to wait a little longer, I may not make it. I'm not very patient.
One time I was patient was at my friend's cousin's birthday party. I was patient as we spent the entire time at the party waiting for answers from parents and friends parents to see if my friends and I could stay overnight. So during the time my friends and I waited, we colored a few dinosaur photos, watched a movie, had dinner, played in the basement, went to the garage for cake and ice cream, decorated/painted our dance kit, and colored again Pictures, watching my friend cousin open his present and more. Then it started to get dark outside so we tried to take a little map @CAPS1 with a whole bunch of kids screaming and it was hard. Soon, my friend had to go, then my parents said we could stay overnight, @CAPS1 OF @CAPS2 My friend's mom said no because my friend had a volleyball game at @TIME1. It felt like I was waiting for nothing. Then I realized that when your patients get what you want, you get what you want more often.
Patience is important, as I've learned from experience before. At one point, I chose to take care of my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight and @PERSON3 is six. I had to watch it by myself for three hours. I can call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I need help, but if I do, I don't get paid. @CAPS3 will pay $20 if I can handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do it. I arrived at @CAPS1's house around 13:00. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 just got back from a friend's birthday party and they must have eaten a lot of sugary food like @CAPS2, cake and ice cream. @CAPS3 Suffice to say they were excited when they greeted me with a lively attitude as soon as I walked in the door. My @CAPS1 is gone and I'm stuck with them. @PERSON1 wants to play on his console. But @PERSON3 waits to play box @NUM1. When they started arguing about what to do, I started to get angry. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided a little more patience was worth getting paid for. So to resolve their conflict, I found a game that we can all play and enjoy. After two hours of playing, we walked into their backyard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 play tags as I watch. However, @PERSON3 was unfair, denied that @PERSON1 tagged him, and started breaking up. I immediately got frustrated with them and picked up the phone. But then I decided, with only an hour left, I could deal with them. So I tell them we can play hide and seek, even though I usually hate being a seeker, @CAPS3 tell them only I can count so they don't fight. Finally, @PERSON2 went home and I got the money @CAPS3 made. That day, I learned that patience always pays off.
Patience @CAPS1 Show courtesy by waiting for someone or something. Patience is polite, if you are impatient it means you are actually being mean because you are judging someone or getting them to do something very fast. For example, if you're waiting in line to hitch a ride at comiville or elsewhere, you'll be nice to others if you're patient and don't try to be in a hurry or anything like that. if you. Impatient, you're in line, you're mean to other people, like "hurry up I want to take that ride, or hurry up and start the ride. There are examples. If you're a patient person, people might like You. If you are impatient, then you may have a hard time getting along with someone.
I have been patient many times. Once I took the @CAPS1 test, we spent a long time testing different parts. I always finish early so I can't move on to the next part. We also couldn't talk or leave the set. I really want to move on to the next part because I still have a lot of time and nothing to do. Everyone in the class finished early and it felt like we couldn't talk. We just sat down and weighed in to wait for the test time to end. Do this for a few days a year. I am patient every year. That was a story about when I had patience.
@NUM1 Patience is when you understand and don't complain. A patient person is someone who can wait, they don't wait every two seconds. People like this can be successful in life. @NUM2 @CAPS1! @PERSON2 is getting closer. First @PERSON6, then @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @PERSON7. She's coming to my row next. It's another night. When someone is going to pinch me, I wake up. @NUM3 "@PERSON5." @PERSON3 and with the force of disappointment "@CAPS2 didn't do well this festival". I think you should be pampered. It seemed to me that I was praying that she wouldn't say the word, and she replied, "@CAPS3." When I got home, my mom was mad at the letter and agreed. Why do I have to fall into history. Coming out next week. We sat down and she was about to say something so I took a deep breath, you have to be patient and not complain. I nodded, laughing until my lips almost fell. @NUM4 in a few weeks. I feel better every day. Her name is @PERSON4. She is very friendly and attentive. She told me that I am waiting and seeing the results. Finally got to the hundredth there. I was nervous, but also confident at the same time. Hope he meets my test in progress! A week later, @PERSON1 passed @PERSON6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 and @PERSON7. Well done @PERSON5 with a smile on her face, you got an A-. Begging is hard work, but I am patient and have good grades. @NUM5 wait, don't fantasize and see the final result. Patience has helped me because I know to be tolerant in the future. A patient person is a person who achieves goals.
One time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister, niece and I are going to @NUM1's barbershop. I am getting my hair cut by an official barber. I waited until @NUM2 got a haircut. That's when I'm patient
The time I have patience is now @DATE1. The reason is because I'm waiting for @CAPS1 new phone. See @DATE2, I spelled orange juice on @CAPS1 phone. Everyone would call me eccentric and responsible. At first @CAPS1 calls were fine and everything was fine. Then one day the @CAPS1 speakers stopped working. I can call anyone or listen to music. @CAPS1 Heart sinks. I quickly ran to my dad @CAPS1 and told him about @CAPS1's problems. He held back first and shook his head. Then grab the @CAPS1 phone and test it out. After disconnecting, it didn't work and his face was shocked. Then he asked me how this happened. Now I was in shock so I can't figure it out. Then I thought of the picture of me spilling orange juice. Something tells me to keep it a secret from @CAPS1 dad. Anyway, when I said it, he laughed. I looked at him, Dad, why are you laughing. "You're going to have to wait until I get the money," he said. @CAPS1 has a calm face, but I'm still waiting for the call.
@PERSON1 is your average age of 14. @CAPS5 has a @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and an annoying eight year old brother named @PERSON2. @CAPS9 The parent's name doesn't quite fit. it is? ? Begging for school and @CAPS9 @CAPS3 had to take @LOCATION1 to buy clothes. The problem is that @CAPS5 let @LOCATION2 in. @CAPS5 not complaining for a month. @CAPS11, oh @CAPS11, @CAPS5 must be ??! sigh. Oh well, it's too late now. @PERSON1 thinks @CAPS5 is helping @CAPS9 in boys department @CAPS1 not picking clothes for @ORGANIZATION1. His eyes @CAPS5 from @CAPS9 seeing more and more, daring to get a better look, @CAPS5 breathless @CAPS5 may not be able to pick some guys for his school @CAPS6 as @CAPS9 picks clothes in boys department! I stare, @CAPS5 needs to go to the women's room and stay there until @CAPS9 gets @CAPS9. Dare? ? so awkward. "@CAPS8 is so understanding." @CAPS9 @CAPS1 said. "I know this is for you, @CAPS8 let @CAPS9 not complain." "@PERSON1 what," @CAPS8, @CAPS10. " @CAPS11 Patience is a good thing. @CAPS5 thinks @CAPS5 has left the class.
When I was in a store I found my friend from @LOCATION1 and started talking to me about the patient, hello started talking to me about that, I told the hem I didn't know what was the main thing and we started explaining that for me What and how to get started. Then he told me a story about that, which I was learning.
Every day I have to be patient, actually everyone has to be patient. But do you have patience with your siblings? If so, then you know how I felt when my sister didn't want to leave for the reasons she wanted. I was trying to get my sister out with me the other day because we had a special willow tree that we were going to bump into no matter what and I digress because she kept refusing to go out to work out I had to end up telling my mom you can imagine One she didn't have, my sister brought a book, we allocated and then what? Here we are? ? ? Greatly? ? ? Among my neighbors, we parted ways, sure, I didn't? ? ? This had to be wasted for a friend's house? ? ? Until she realizes she wants to follow her. So I've been annoyed with patience, but? ? ? Telling it here is a virtue so a guess? ? ? OK.
I understand patience as people encounter difficult and forgiving patients? ? ? Does today mean patience is his? ? America today. ?? have one? ? Tim? ? ? samh yes, and today she did it ??. But she? ? ho). yours??. ?? she? ? ? (@CAPS1
The one time I had patience was when a new video game came out. I asked my dad @CAPS1 we can book it but he said no, I have to wait until @CAPS2. So I waited until @CAPS2 and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was my birthday and I opened my last gift, which was a video game! I was so excited I gave my parents @CAPS4 and my brother to play it.
When you are patient, you will be more peaceful and happy. It's like next week is your birthday and you don't want to wait for it and have to get angry because you want your present today instead of next week. But you can't so you start hitting stuff like crazy, not that you don't have a good actor. Then you ask your parents to do it and they bring some of your gifts back to their store, that's impatient. When your anger becomes that you can't get what you want, it's impatience.
The key to long journeys is patience. This is important because it actually makes travel faster. This is a story about how I had really good patients. @CAPS5 is loading up for a three hour drive to @CAPS1 Water Park at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Everyone was ready, except my parents of course. Who goes in to check everything, get directions, call my unlce to see if @CAPS3 is ready while us kids have been sitting in the car waiting. Of course, my bro @CAPS2 was up and running until @CAPS3 finally couldn't take it anymore and he started walking around. "That's it!" @CAPS3 exclaimed: "I'm going in to pick them up!" @CAPS3 is the most impatient of us all. Even my two younger sisters have longer patience than @CAPS3. Does this tell you a lot? Taylor came out in NUM1 minutes to tell us they were coming. Incorrect! They didn't come out for @NUM2 minutes again and my brother was pissed. "@CAPS4 took you so long?" @CAPS3 asked. "@CAPS5 has to make sure Uncle @PERSON1 is ready to leave." My dad covered. @CAPS5 In the beginning, everyone fell asleep and accepted my dad who was driving. So no one really does a lot. At least @CAPS5 is patient, except my brother @CAPS3 is still there.
Patience is one of many things children learn as they grow up. They mature and we use these life lessons and life guides when they need them. I can't tell you how many times my mom told me to be patient. It was used every day when I was growing up. However, I gradually learned and realized how important patience is. If you're impatient, you have to understand that people will most likely try their best to do what they do for you. When I was seven years old, I really found the meaning of the word in the mall. While I experienced this importance and knew I had to wait, early in my life it didn't mean I was content and patient. We were shopping at my favorite store called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I got a bunch of clothes and my sister @PERSON1 who is @NUM1. After a long wait of about @NUM2 minutes, the locker room is finally open. Suddenly a locker room opened and @ORGANIZATION1 ran in. I cried because I was in front of her and it wasn't fair. She killed me anyway. I'm the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. About @NUM4 minutes after her and my mom's fashion show, I'm done. I want to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door and she told me she would move it away. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she went out. Getting me into the locker room was a reward for my patience. I think that day whether it's a long or a short wait, in the long run, you'll get what you want. So be patient, good things will come your way like karma, come and go.
I was so patient last time I went to the doctor, @CAPS1 and my brother @CAPS2 had to wait outside the waiting room until they called us for an injection. Everyone else started to clear their minds and we stayed patient. It was really boring to sit there, but we were patient. After about two or three hours, we are not as patient as we were a few hours ago. So we decided to go up and ask what happened. We found out we forgot to log in, so once we were done, we went in.
Patience is waiting for your turn @CAPS1, you don't complain about waiting like... Get through the day patiently and wait for school to dismiss. Don’t complain about going to school too long or pretending to be sick just to get home or pretending to be red-eyed…. etc. You have to wait for school to finish, patience is not waiting for things to pass @CAPS1 may be waiting in line. Waiting to use something.. etc. Not all people are patient. I'm not a very patient person when @CAPS1 gets home on time! I don't like waiting for people or @CAPS2 or food! I'm very patient when @CAPS1 shoots or anything doctor related.
It's a morning @DATE1 in Wisconsin, the last day of deer hunting. I got up to dress my dad and friends and we all sat down to eat and we ate pankacs and milk. It was about @NUM1 outside, so we fueled up and headed for it. I was a little scared at the worst of the night because we didn't know what was out there or who was there. But after we got in. He stood in all my ways and went away. After @NUM2 hours at the booth, my dad told me "@CAPS1 time to go back to eat", not now" I said "@CAPS1" to my dad and then I think I'll see you later, so wait for him Came back and it was right around @NUM3 when I took out the money I've been waiting for from brunch. So I bought my gun and shot him. I've never been so proud in my life @CAPS3.
Patience, if you are a patient person, you will be tolerant and understanding. I was very patient for a while. "Can @CAPS1 go @CAPS3!?" @CAPS2," she replied, "@CAPS3 needs to buy all your school supplies. "I've always hated going back to school shopping. That meant going to a store with @CAPS1 and spent @NUM1 hours trying to find clothes, notebooks, pencil clips and pens." @CAPS4 Am I really going too? ""@CAPS5 how is the patient? ""@CAPS6, I answered. I started to be more patient every time I had to buy clothes or pencils. Whenever I have to wait @CAPS1. I just sit there, I just sit and wait. It's been @NUM1 hours for @CAPS7 but @CAPS7 feels like 20 minutes and the day seems to go by a lot faster when @CAPS3 leaves. I won't wait until next year, I want to go shopping again!
When you are patient, you come, without complaining. You are understanding and forgiving. When you're patient with something, you're steady with it and? ? ? . You don't have the patience to give you a lot of time because you're nervous. How about you? ? Very stable, so he is very patient. there's still one? ? ? people encounter difficulties. When are you patient? ? Waiting to get something they don't know? ? That is patience. When your patience you? come on, if you? ? ?
Patience, having patience means you won't complain about things that take a long time. You are tolerant and understanding. Some of the reasons you should be patient @CAPS7 is. You @CAPS7 @CAPS8 have a long queue, and the entire time you wait, you say, "@CAPS1, this needs @CAPS5." Or, "@CAPS1, When @CAPS3 @CAPS6 left." @CAPS3 not @CAPS6 just @CAPS9? " Your @CAPS1 will be thinking, "@CAPS4, oh my gosh, will you stop talking?" " Or she just wants to @CAPS8 scream. So your @CAPS1 may never want @CAPS8 to take you where you need to wait again because she knows you are @CAPS8 impatient @CAPS8 to deal with it. Maybe you don't want @CAPS8 Some of the reasons CAPS8 is patient or you don't want @CAPS8 to be patient could be like you have a meeting with your teacher and if you're late then you're going to make a bad first impression on @CAPS7. So your @CAPS1 is getting Calling with @CAPS5, so you keep saying, ''@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9!" @CAPS10 You're impatient. Although, patience is basically like a gentle way of waiting. Even internally, you imagine yourself screaming at the person you are waiting for. In the outside place, you are waiting patiently. So, it's good to have patience. Try it, sometimes just don't let your inner feelings tear apart what's going on outside.
Patience is when you are waiting for something. When you rush that is not patience. When you are patient, you do not rush. Another implication of @CAPS1 is when you stay calm, be patient and don't get angry. Some say they are losing @CAPS1's patience, which means @CAPS1 is about to get angry. Those meanings of patience @CAPS1 are when I am patient. I'm waiting for @CAPS2 to come. I wait, I wait, I wait I'm not in a hurry They say @CAPS2 is @CAPS4's birthday. The Bible says to be patient, and I did. Not sure when @CAPS2 is coming, I'm still waiting, finally! Here comes @CAPS2.
When I'm patient is when @CAPS1 comes. I was hungry so I went in and asked @CAPS2 when is dinner? Also @CAPS3 and hours.
Patience is a valve. This is a story about patience. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lives with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to hang out. She told her uncle that she would be in the woods that day and not to worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 told her to be careful and watch out for the evil witch. @PERSON1 jumping into the woods. When @PERSON1 arrived in the woods, she walked over to her favorite spot, the tree castle her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there, she climbed to the top and opened the door. Waiting for her inside was completely unexpected. Sit with the wicked. When @PERSON1 didn't come home that night, uncle got worried. He searched and searched for her, but found nothing. He tried to be patient, but it was difficult. The next day, @PERSON1's uncle was arrested because the police thought he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to wait patiently again. In the end the police also found the witch and @PERSON1, @PERSON1's uncle's patience paid off and he was free. Since that day, @ORGANIZATION1 has had patience. This is when Uncle @ORGANIZATION1 has patience.
I have been very patient this week. I really want a wii and no one will buy me one. So I've been saving money for so long. Then I had to wait a few weeks to feel like @NUM1 days (@NUM2 weeks). I'm counting down the days. That just makes it feel longer. So I decided to tell myself I didn't want it, so I wasn't in a rush to get it. that kind of work. But when I got it to tell you the truth, it wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.
In my opinion, I am a very patient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something, they better stop on the spot or @PERSON1 I comment, kids make a huge breakthrough, and, I'm not one of those kids waiting for dinner, I'll snack! When I was at school, I just @CAPS1 listened to meap instructions for hours on end. It reminds me that my teacher is driving me crazy. ! He has absolutely no patience in any aspect, shape or form. As soon as we make a sound, he will run wild! In general, I think people need more patience these days.
Patience is a very good thing that I and many others lack. Someone who doesn't lack patience is the head coach of @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been very patient over the past few years. He's not trying to make his team better than them, he's just letting them try their @CAPS2 and see what the end result is. @ORGANIZATION4 ended up getting @NUM1 that year and had the second-worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3, who picked up the #2 pick in the @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft, @ORGANIZATION4 took @ORGANIZATION5 out of @ORGANIZATION2's defensive lineman. He's a great player and another pick from @ORGANIZATION4 is a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 from @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1's team has been so good this year because of @PERSON1's patience with the team and understanding of the talent of the players.
Who likes to be patient, it's so boring. All it does is waste your time. But we all know it's good to be patient and have patience. I'm not really a patient person, but they have to be patient a lot of the time. When I was @NUM1, I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six, not including me. I really like video games, I have @NUM2 brothers and @NUM2 sisters. We only have one video game station. That's the game block. We also only have one controller. It's really hard to wait patiently for your turn because my brothers always have to go first and they never get off. But one time was harder than any other. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and can't wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it from me and ran upstairs to play. I was really sad and angry, but I didn't complain, I just sat behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I feel so empty, but I still have no complaints. I ended up sitting there @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not great, but I gotta play. To this day I remember how hard it was, but then, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do what you really want to do and you can't, just be patient and it will pay off.
The one time I showed patience was when my sister broke my futon. Just the day I got it, I was watching a movie in the living room when all of a sudden I heard "@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, bang bang bang!" I ran upstairs wondering what was going on, I saw mine My sister was on the bed and my other sister was standing there, pale as a ghost. I didn't yell at them and showed patience. I quickly got another futon that didn't break, and now my sisters know not to mess with the ones that will break! This is the story where I used to show patience!
One day, as I was walking to the side, I found a snake on a rock. I yelled for my brother who was playing his game. He said 'Wait a minute, I'm going to beat the leaves' but the snake was becoming like, 'Now it's finally gone, and ten minutes later he came out of the house staring at what was in my hand. He asked me 'why' You have a snake" I replied "I saw it was cool". He liked me and let it go.
One night my @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister @PERSON1 fell asleep. Our parents are on the computer. @CAPS4 Usually don't stay up that late. So I just think @CAPS2 is doing something for the job. At @TIME1, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 are laughing and standing in the kitchen when we wake up. @CAPS2 carrying something. "I wonder if @CAPS3 could be..." I thought. I asked @CAPS9 mom "@CAPS3 is in progress!?!" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowly pulled a document from behind and handed it to us. The title of the file is "@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8". @CAPS9 Parents are giggling @CAPS11 @CAPS9 Sister and I stare at each other in amazement. @CAPS11 If we're reading each other's minds, we all know we're going on a cruise! I smiled excitedly and looked at @CAPS15 on paper. "@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2." it said. Today is @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2, "It's like, 2 months from now!!!" "@CAPS10," @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, "you have to be patient." @CAPS11 Normal kids do this. I said "@CAPS12..." @CAPS9 @CAPS2 knew @CAPS9 was disappointed and said "@CAPS14 things will happen to those who wait. I nod my head in satisfaction. I know I'm going to have to get through these two months And be patient. The first few weeks were like Monte for us. We were in a hurry @CAPS11, you will guess. But, @CAPS11 has made it easier for patients over time. I was able to focus on the cruise Other things. At <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, it's time for us to fly and cruise." So fast! It's over so soon! I'm so excited, @CAPS2! I said when we were boarding. "I'm so proud of you, son. You we have patience!" That's when I learned to be patient! @CAPS11 @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, "@CAPS14 whoever waits will meet."
I'm going to tell you a time when I'm patient. I was patient at one point because I had to save up to get the halo of a new game. I had to pre-order it with my money, so I did a lot of work, so I mowed the lawn at my house, and then for two bucks someone else's, so I ended up doing it for about two months. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre-ordered and they told me I had to wait three weeks, so I did. I waited to buy some other stuff with the remaining money and the game finally arrived. That's when I use the patient to wait for something.
There was once a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient. One day @PERSON1 is going to get her driver's license. She is happy to be able to drive. When @PERSON1 arrived at the permit location, she saw a lot of people waiting. She estimates there are about @NUM1 people there, "@CAPS1 there must be so many here," she thought. After about @NUM2 minutes of waiting, she drove @CAPS6 crazy as only one person got a license during that time. She was taken aback there. "Ah! I should have gotten my driver's license today instead of waiting for a bunch of experienced adults to renew their licenses!" she started chattering. "@CAPS1 are you taking so long! You're too slow!" She got home and started talking to her fan @CAPS3 on her phone. "@CAPS2 there are a lot of people I'll never get my license @CAPS3!" "@PERSON1 calm down. Stop being so impatient." "@CAPS4 this line is long and. ' @PERSON2 cut @PERSON1. "@CAPS5 You keep running home crying and you'll never get your driver's license. The line to apply for a driver's license is always long. I had to wait @NUM2 hours to get mine. “@CAPS6 Five hours!” “@CAPS7, @CAPS4 I spent @NUM4 hours so I don’t get bored. Keep my phone with me.” @CAPS8,’’ @PERSON1 replied. She returned to the license the next day, with her phone and a book. While she waited, she texted her friends and read her book online to complete her book project. She's been lining up for @CAPS4 and she didn't even realize @CAPS11. @PERSON1 waited @NUM5 hours for @CAPS4 that day she only thinks @CAPS11 is @NUM4 because she's totally focused. It felt great for @PERSON1 to finally get her license, she was the second person in school to get one (after @PERSON2). “@CAPS9 @PERSON2 you taught me how to be patient and calm.” “@CAPS10 questions, @CAPS11 is the least I can do for my best friend.”
Patience means you are understanding and forgiving. A patient person encounters difficulties without complaining. The one time I had patience was when my parents didn't know it was half a day at school. In a day in elementary school, we had half a day of things that our parents didn't know. After school, I waited almost @NUM1 minutes in the parking lot for my parents to pick me up. I started thinking my parents wouldn't come until the teacher asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation, the teacher asked me to call my parents. After I explained, my father had agreed and went to pick me up, and then I could finally go home.
I've applied for patents many times, but when I order a new console, I have to be patient. My dad and I got a game console that will be on our porch in two weeks. It feels like a lifetime for me, but I have to be patient. I didn't complain for those fourteen days, and neither did my father. It's definitely worth the wait when it arrives. That's a time to be patient rather than complaining.
I was in fastifal when I was patint. I wanted something to eat and the line was huge. The other time was when I wanted to ride and the line was huge. This is for @CAPS1, @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 Corsair, Swing. There is a line to play this big basketball game.
Do you have enough patients to handle @NUM1 screaming kids. I, proud to say I can. It all started when my uncle Steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They need a lot of help, so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take her five kids along with my sister and I to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem is @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 hers. So we packed all our luggage and set off. I have an expedition vehicle on my @CAPS1 @DATE1 so all of us @NUM2 can fit it. However, it didn't take long for everyone to feel uncomfortable. Everyone started to feel suffocated and became very hot. So all the @NUM1 kids started fighting. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 stress is really fast. Thank god there was at least one @CAPS5.V in that car. But I'm sitting in the front, so I didn't '@CAPS5 look at it. After about @NUM1 hours, I've had enough. My legs were getting cramps and the constant movement made me dizzy. We've driven about @NUM7 hours so far with only one rest stop. It's dark outside now. At this moment, we are the only people on the road. I sat lower in my seat. And then @CAPS6. Everyone screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we were in a car accident, but when I opened my eyes, I was alive. We hit a deer. It slides over the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we arrive at @LOCATION2@NUM9. Morning is @NUM10! I ended up being surprised by how many patients I had. After that, I don't think I want to take another road trip.
Patience is when you have a problem and don't complain. You need to be patient at the amusement park for all the lines. Patience is not a complaint about boarding a long-distance bus. You need to be patient to fish or get a reward, which saves other people's headaches. If you are patient, you will always feel stressed. So you should always be patient, it can make your life so easy, fishing where long lines won't look as long is great for patience.
patient day. I remember one time I was very patient with toy cars. Four @CAPS1 I don't want to wait @NUM1 days. I feel like I'm in prison every day. So I get mad at slapping people in the face every day, it's so funny, so my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is mad at me. Then my mom got me punished. After a few days, I was doing well at school. So my mom is proud of me. Then she told me a lot of things. Later on Christmas day we had turkey ranch dressing. Then I open my present. I have toy cars, @NUM2, monster truck shoes and @ORGANIZATION1 blue, red, @CAPS4 collars you can think of. So that's why I'm patient with that toy I'm happy with, my @CAPS5 stopped and gave me @NUM3 little ones. Then he took my ice @CAPS6 shade to become these skinny tits. But in the end it all worked out for me. I got everything I wanted, I wanted a load touch with @NUM3 @CAPS7. It felt like I was rich on Christmas Day.
One day this girl in @CAPS3 really wanted to go to school shopping in @CAPS3 and had to wait because her mom said @CAPS3 don't take her money now @CAPS3 got it later in @CAPS1 and her mom said wait She told the latter that @CAPS3 no because her new stuff was already in her room, so when her mom came back @CAPS3 said we were going to @CAPS1 and her mom said to go upstairs in her room to get the coat. @CAPS3 went upstairs to get her jacket when @CAPS3 went up in her room @CAPS3 saw new clothes in five new shoes, @CAPS3 screamed in @CAPS3 went downstairs to tell her mom thank you @CAPS3 said Welcome @CAPS1 Her mom said I told you I was going to get your stuff @CAPS3 said you just have to wait for the payment.
Patience is a feeling when you go through a tough task and try your best to get over it without complaining about the task, like when you get the paint out and then you squeeze it won't come out, but you keep trying until you find it's gone . Then you go buy a new bottle and start using it. I wish more people would be patient so we don't listen to the constant complaints.
When I have to be patient is when I have to? ? My little brother and my two cousins. This requires a lot of patience. One day, I received a call from my aunt. She said she needed one? ? ? Babysitter for my two and seven year old cousins. She said she would pay me if I wanted to? ? them. So I say yes. I hut I did it? ? I got myself into trouble. My mom in a few days??? (@CAPS1) @CAPS2 Good for me after all.
Patience can be one of the hardest things in the world to do. I remember one time I had the patience when my family and I went to @CAPS1 o'clock. When we got to @CAPS1 point we were all ready to ride Magnum, which we had never ridden the last time we were there. So we're going to ride that first. After a while, we got in line and we had to wait for the rain to stop - an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided I'd be a little more patient and not complain. Although, it was a little painful not being able to sit down after a while, but I still never complained. After a while, I actually started forgetting that I was in line because people started making us more. I wanted to stop complaining about work because my whole family was in a good mood after we got out of the car. So I decided to learn how to be more patient with people, because before we touched the bumper cars, everything was well done.
A man in a suit is waiting to enter the double doors of @LOCATION1, I'm @CAPS1, "Welcome to that man"? ? ? Can we keep going as soon as we get in? ? ? ? ? ? in front of us. "When does the show start?" I asked excitedly. "@CAPS2 until about @NUM1." my mom replied. 8:30 was still an hour away and we couldn't be seated due to the crowd in front of us. @NUM2 minutes passed and @CAPS2 was admitted alone. @CAPS2 Even elegant music can cover up the din of the crowd. Another @NUM3 minutes passed and our seats were finally waiting for us. Walking down the sidewalk, as the show begins, I sit comfortably in seat @NUM4.
Patience is sometimes a difficult character trait. @CAPS1 is also a good option, @CAPS1 can help you in many situations. If gas is patient, you won't be nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for my birthday present because my friend @PERSON1 was buying it for me. I didn't think much about @CAPS1, so @CAPS1 didn't really find me. I know @CAPS1 will be cool, it makes patience harder. I can still forget about @CAPS1. I have to make sure I'm not thinking about @CAPS1 so I'm not begging my friends to know what @CAPS1 is because that would be impatient. If your impatient person might get mad at you for always asking questions and get nervous there. @CAPS1 It's good to be patient with friendships so you don't get mean to them or anyone else. @CAPS2 of @CAPS1 Not being impatient with your family. If your patients can solve problems better and focus more on tasks and focus.
You always have to be patient when you are at the store or the doctor or wherever you are waiting for something or you will never be able to do anything. I remember when my mom and I were at the store and we had to wait in long lines to get some groceries, but if we didn't have the patience, we would put things back and go home, but it felt like we did have the patience to buy stuff. That's why, if you don't, you won't be able to do anything you want.
This is a story about my patience. So the story starts with the Art Awards, where I love seeing beautiful art, but I'm dying to see the winning photos of the Art Awards. My parents told me to wait until we all see the rest of the Art Awards. So I signed and replied ok and we can look at the rest of the Art Awards stuff first. When we've been looking at art, I've been thinking about winning pieces. This is what I thought. ? ? ? a little later. I'm thinking how lucky I am to have an art award here. So I have peace of mind, patience is good. And if you wait a while and it all gets soggy, it seems to be more valuable. A few hours later, I started walking towards the car, and my mom interrupted him, "@CAPS1, don't you want to see the winning artwork?" "@CAPS2 Yeah, I forgot." @CAPS3 has no lines right now, so when When we went to see it, there was no line. I am the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of a sergeant drawn in pencil. I knew that day that patience is important because it pays to wait to see what you like.
When other people I know have patience, I try to spend the night with my friend @CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers as they were out for an anniversary dinner. It was around @NUM1pm when they left and we just started digging @CAPS2 for deep dish pizza. Halfway through the meal, I received a text message from the neighbor next door, ? ? ? My best friend, asked me if I wanted to spend the night. I replied that my parents were out and they would be back in a few hours, I'll ask later. @CAPS6 Finally around @NUM2 pm, my parents got home and I asked about the overnight stay. She said, "I don't know," and walked away. After about an hour, I got my answer. Yes! I text @CAPS1 to say I can. She replied "Finally!" @CAPS4 I had to pack. @CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I needed for the night. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom yelled from upstairs, "@CAPS5! I need you to get the dog out before you leave!" @CAPS6 I put everything down, put the dog on a leash and stood outside in the pouring rain Wait for them to end. When they were done, I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door, and she let me do other things. When I got to @CAPS7's house, she opened the door and let me in. I said, "@CAPS8 took @CAPS6 a long time. Thank you for being a @CAPS6 patient!"
I don't have time for patience, so today I'm going to write about how impatient I am. I am thankful that one day I stood in line to stare. (@org1). I'm having a hot day and I'm ready to go to my cool big house to relax. You all know how many years old people walk slowly and talk a lot. If you have noticed. @NUM1 people in front of me. He spends all day digging his wallet and talking a lot. So I said "you know I'm going to another @ORGANIZATION1 and give me a slippery deserved ritual knowing I can't handle this slow or wet day" and left.
Patience can be very difficult at times, especially when whatever you're patiently waiting for is distracting and painful. This is the story of how I waited patiently when I fell outside? ? ? ? Myself. One day, my brother and I were playing outside. We are throwing water balloon mchother. I was soaking wet from head to toe, but we continued to play. Suddenly, I heard a buzzing in my ear. I turned around and saw a huge man beside me. I'm only @NUM1 and very scared of bees. I turned and rushed into the driveway and continued to circle the house, thinking the bees were still following me. I was starting to get tired so I tripped and shaved off a lot of skin in the process. when i see blood from? ? ? Tell my mother inside. "@CAPS1! I fell!" I managed to scream between sobbing. "@CAPS2 OMG! Let me find some Band-Aids that my mom answered. My little body can't handle the pain. I've been crying silently but I know I'll have to wait patiently for my mom to find the bandages. Just @CAPS2 DATE1, I wasted a bunch of band-aids putting them on my face that I didn't know about. I had to wait patiently for a long time until my mom usually found the bandages. I found them!" my mom said, running down ? ? ? There / WAS settings. "@CAPS3 are you so patient?" @CAPS4 The stock strap crossed my leg and gave me a lollipop. Through patience, I know I'm a good girl.
Yo! I'm the narrator...you know the storyteller, then I'm going to tell you a story about patience. Okay, so, there's this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 is an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 is the smart @CAPS1 who came up with the idea and decided to make his own shell. @CAPS1 goes to the junkyard to find something that can help him make the shell. He found a lot of light-weight metal, so he took it home, melted it down, and began the long process of forging his shell from the metal. When his shell was done, he tried it on and it fit and comfortable. He went to school the next day and everyone was impressed and super shiny. @CAPS1 is no longer teased. @CAPS1 had to be patient making his shell!
Being patient is a very difficult thing. Many people are impatient. Like my brother. If he ordered something online or was waiting for dinner, he always had to be careful to know when he could get what he wanted. I am not like that. I actually have patience. For example, I need shoes, so I search the Internet to see if I can get a good one. I was searching the @ORGANIZATION1 store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order online. So the next day my mom ordered them online and I was so excited I waited and waited. Three days later, I missed the school bus. My mom has to go to college and she can't let me go. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad happened to be home that day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning. My mom came home and saw a box in front of it. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes inside! I went to meet her and I saw my shoes were there. I jumped in excitement and put them on and they fit so well. My mom came into the room and said they were supposed to arrive on @DATE1, but they came early because of your patience.
I've never bent a "patient" guy @CAPS1 this girl I know @PERSON1 she's always patient, like when I'm terrified of sledding down a hill, I won't go down a hill I keep saying "I don't go downhill. " @CAPS1 About @NUM1 minutes later, she's still a patent, and she says "@CAPS2 I'm punching down and you're going to fall." I said yes, so she's down more than I do. The day of the last yares dance, it took me a long time to get dressed, we were all late @CAPS1, she was so patient, my price was too high. I think she has a lot of patients and I hope some of them make a difference to me because I need some and use it ASAP because I bet I'm the only one in the world who doesn't have a patient wow!
One rainy day, my dad's leg was his brother. He took the doctor but it didn't work so we took him to the hospital in Coro. They looked at his legs and told us we had to go to the hospital at Covent Hospital in @LOCATION1, so we went to @LOCATION1. When we got to the hospital, these were like @NUM1 people in the bathroom. My dad waited patiently. When we had to enter the room. My dad had to get an X-ray. He was also patient enough to wait and see what went wrong. when he found out what was wrong. He had to wait longer to see if he needed surgery on his leg after he was patient enough to do it. He is patient enough to do the surgery. It's a good thing that my dad has enough patience because his legs are fine I don't think my dad has enough patience.
I have patience with @CAPS1 every year so I can get some @CAPS2. I'm buying @CAPS2 , but I can't buy any more because @CAPS1 is coming, that's why I'm going to be patient as it will see longer if I'm excited. Being patient every day, sometimes I can't wait to get out of school so I can play. I've been trying to be patient as it's one vacation after another, each one getting more exciting. Every child tries, but patience is one of the hardest things to do. My patience is that I act as if nothing exciting is about to happen.
Today is Thanksgiving. We had to drive to ??? to visit my cousins. This car is on @NUM1 trips. But patience is hard, I wish I could get a ticket, I see cool stuff. A generation? ? ? To get there we turn off the highway??? We are??? We sat down with our family to find out we gave a gift wnD @CAPS1 a turkey @CAPS2. ? ? ? illegible
On the way to @STATE1 I was patient as I had to wait for the bus. I also? ? ? on some sites? Bus @NUM1 it or @CAPS1 he got it? ? ? Those I'm too tired? ? The bus arrived and I fell asleep.
Today is the last day of tryouts. decisive day. Our tryout ended and I patiently waited for @CAPS2 to hand out envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I don't know if this can be handled. "@CAPS1 until you leave the building to open your envelope," @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS3 only fair. If everyone turned them on here, the guys who didn't get into the team would feel sad and frustrated, and the girls who got into the group would jump for joy, it would make the girls who didn't get into @CAPS3 feel even more Frustrated and excluded. Please be patient @CAPS1 until you leave the building. She called my name. I came up and grabbed my envelope. She fired us. Some girls opened their envelopes right away. However, they didn't do @CAPS3 .karma. I waited until I was out. I could barely @CAPS1. I need to know, but I have to @CAPS1. Patience isn't always cute. I opened my envelope. I formed a team! I'm so excited , glad I was patient with @CAPS1 and surprised.
It's my family vacation and we're going to @CAPS1 point. We stayed at the amazing hotel, it was beautiful, you could see a real waterfall, it was like a haven. We are in this huge room with @NUM1 big bathroom and @CAPS2. Then, when I look out the window, I can see the Rolercoster and various rides. But they bring these known ride-calling @CAPS3 breakers: it's @NUM200ft tall, as big as libaty's statin, it makes you fall @NUM200ft like one! Tanado. It moves from side to side. I went there with my mom and dad and we wanted to ride. But @NUM4 people are in line. My parents don't use a different ride, but I want to get rid of this. So I'm waiting in line and I know I have to be patient, but @NUM1 hours have passed and I'm starting to lose my patients. There are only @NUM6 people in front of me. Finally it was my turn and I got on it, pulling me to @NUM7000 for the first time. Feet and dropedme, spin, twist me until I get tired and finally I get off. You can see I'm crying, but it's not a bad cry, it's a good cry, so that's when I'm patient
I stomped my feet in the elevator, smooth jazz blaring from the overhead speakers. Eventually the familiar click sounded and the glossy metal door slid open to reveal a beautifully furnished hallway where many others were waiting for @CAPS6 they leave? ? ? I slipped out, now trying to get trampled by a large crowd, and then, silence. The sound of my footsteps? ? ? When I search for @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finally finding my destination, I opened the door and walked into the place where many other impatient kids were waiting. I took off my coat and hung it on a nearby hook, trying not to pay too much attention to myself. I continued to search the magazine section, ripping through @CAPS1 magazines and carefully crafted sports illustrations, until I found an interesting swim article. Underarm magazine I picked a corner seat and waited. A few minutes passed, and I could tell the kid next to me was getting impatient quickly, tapping his mom's jacket repeatedly, asking him the same thing @NUM2 minutes ago, "@CAPS2 how much longer?" Mother looked at her watch and replied in a tone that bordered on exasperation, "Not much now, honey." @CAPS3, the little boy leaned back in the seat and put his thumb in his mouth to give him something to do . I rolled my eyes, but couldn't help but smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowned as @CAPS5 texted on her phone, took a quick look at the clock, and @CAPS5 continued frowning. Just then, the glass door slid open, and a woman with tired eyes came out with a homemade perm. Opposite the waiting room, the patient looked up at her with anticipation and hope in her eyes. " Dr @PERSON1 can see you now." @CAPS4, avoiding the angry glances of the other patients, I followed her out the door. "You know it's funny," @CAPS5 said, biting on the gum. "@CAPS6 someone. So young, you are the most patient person out there!" I just nodded and smiled, because I understand patient people, go through hard times without complaining, and I'm so thankful that I'm a patient person. stand
One day my brother, my mother and I were going to the hospital because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctor's office and sat in the waiting area. They called my mom and brother. So I had to stay. My mom said it only takes two minutes. Guess what she did wrong. It took her two hours to come back. So when I was patient, I texted my aunties and friends. I have also played some games. I actually carry my @CAPS1. So I waited and waited. I'm so bored, I go out for some fresh air. Then I got tired and I just sat there. Finally they came out. Guess my mom said "how are you darling" and then my mom told me my brother was sick. I'm patient, we eat at @ORGANIZATION1. after? ? ? I was patient in the clinic so we spent @NUM1 minutes. so i'm here? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? to sleep. I was? ? ? ? ? ? Because I'm patient isn't that? ? ? Believe? ? ? It's actually easy. Is that one? ? ?
Patience is when you're in long lines at the grocery store while you're waiting for a new video game. This happened to me when I was on my way to California. I had to stand in a six long queue for @NUM1 hours and when we finally got there it took us a long time to get to the plains and we were hungry so when we finally got up we had to wait in line @ NUM2 minutes of our food we were starving, we ate and went to a friend's house, we stayed for an hour and it started to get really hot, but I was patient and waited for it to turn out it wasn't that bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life, whether you're a patient or a patient, that week is all about being sick and queuing, it's been a long day. Sadly, we had to leave after that day. Yes you guessed it patience first had to go to Houston TX then @ORGANIZATION1 then we had to drive @NUM3 hours home and when we got home we were so tired we put This story passed on to my friends and family.
To be considered patient, you have to be tolerant and understanding, you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousins, especially when they are babies. This @DATE1, I went to my cousin's house to see her daughter @CAPS1' @PERSON1 for about three hours. I got $50 and I can't wait. When I arrived at their house, @NUM1 was sleeping and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. Once I did, I thought it was a bad idea for her to start screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her on a swing, even tried feeding her but nothing worked. I was so frustrated, I fell down screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half without saying a word. Then I said, "@NUM1, what's wrong?" @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, and she stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was patient because I kept some calm and I didn't complain to @CAPS1' @CAPS4's mom.
Every year since I learned about @LOCATION1 and the gift, now I don't think they ever said you have to wait a few months until @CAPS1 comes along. I love @CAPS1, but once a year or so @CAPS2 patiently waits until @DATE1 goes down. The first @DATE2 of @DATE1 tells me that @CAPS1 comes with all the decorations, cheers and cravings for the joy of @CAPS1. I usually try to pass the time by having a snowball fight with my cousins. I still feel the temptation to try to hurry and make me anxious and exhausted to wait so long, but @CAPS2 is still patient and trying to make the temptation go away. I was so happy when the eve of @CAPS1 came, because @CAPS2, like my parents, couldn't wait for anything that would take a month. Then it comes out as slowly as possible, then goes away faster, and then I can imagine how fast it goes away. Like saying time files sometimes have fans.
When I was a little boy, about seven years old, I was very patient with the @CAPS1 toys I wanted. Since @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 pipe benders were on TV and now in stories I'm obsessed with them and I'm still today @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is @CAPS1 the only person in the world who can master all four elements @CAPS7, @ Location 1, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1. Now I can write you an entire book about @CAPS1. So I saw @CAPS1 on TV so I asked my mom if she could buy it. She said when I got the money, but not before that. So of course I'm not happy. So I waited and counted until the days passed. And then finally that @CAPS12 came along, you know what that means. "@CAPS11 @CAPS12" @CAPS12 By @CAPS12 I got my toy, but I didn't know she was only $200 so I had to wait another week. Distraught, I ran up the stairs, locked the door, and fell asleep crying. My birthday is coming up. I'm so frustrated that I forgot @CAPS12 when my birthday is here can I guess what...? I finally got the best. @CAPS4 and my mom said all the patients you do get what you want.
A patient is like you're waiting for something, you don't complain that it took a long time, you just sit there quietly and wait. Here is an example. Once I was waiting to see the doctor and you were sitting there quietly reading a magazine, just sitting there. example of patience
One day a kid was going to school @CAPS4 was going to hand in a math paper @CAPS2 @CAPS4 did. In the @CAPS1 course, @CAPS4 is doing a chapter sketch. His teacher called him over. The teacher said do you have a story that expired a month ago. @CAPS4 says "no" teacher asks "why" kid says "because I'm going to a basketball game." teacher says "tomorrow." @CAPS2 The next day kids are in class @CAPS1 @CAPS4 says "I'm @CAPS2 sorry , I don't have my paper." The teacher asked "why" "Because my grandfather died." The teacher said, "Good tomorrow." @CAPS2 The child finished his paper.
I've had patience many times in my life, but it's really hard to be patient this time because I'm very interested in architecture. We've been planting for a while as far as I can, we started on @DATE1 after school and we were halfway through that day, but there we couldn't work another week because my brother, sister, dad and Mom has? ? or? ? So I had to wait a week to get it working again. It's really hard to be patient this time because I've been waiting for a while. A week has finally passed, it seems like a month, but now I can get my work done and I'm so excited. After a few days, we finally finished painting the blue and gold walls to the left of you and me @CAPS1 because all we had to do was put my dad on my left and it would go to sleep. I am so glad we have finally finished my room and I can sleep in it.
One time I was very patient was when I was saving up to buy a game. The name is Halo Reach. I had to wait @NUM1 week units to get it. But I've been patient and not asking over and over again.
A few days after @CAPS18 started running @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, an anxious maroon cubby @CAPS1 saw her @CAPS5 plow a big oval and covered it with @CAPS4 to look like dust. "What is @CAPS5 doing at @CAPS4, @CAPS6?" @CAPS7 is very curious about @CAPS3. “@CAPS9 is farming.” @CAPS10 @CAPS11, @CAPS17 for ponies. “@CAPS12 is going to a competition next year called @ORGANIZATION1, that’s how @CAPS18 practices. I want a competition! ' exclaimed @CAPS3 excitedly 'Be patient, darling, you're not even a pony! "@CAPS10 @CAPS11, finally. So @CAPS3 patiently waited for a few weeks. When @CAPS18 can @CAPS18 run the track at night. @CAPS18 counts her time, @CAPS18 is faster and stronger. Two years later @CAPS3 It's a champion straight up to @NUM1 years. "@CAPS17 is right! "@CAPS18 claims 'Patience is the key!
"@CAPS1 did you buy @CAPS10?" I yelled across the room "@CAPS2 haven't made @CAPS10 @CAPS4" my dad said to me. I bought a vape online, @CAPS10 shipped from @LOCATION1. @CAPS10 says the scooter will deliver her in five to eight days. "@CAPS3" I shouted when I bought the @CAPS10, "@CAPS4 all that's left to do is wait. The next morning, I get up at 6am and take the bus to school while I'm in class, all I can think of is Scooter. Patience @CAPS5 - Patience, I think. After school I will go to closed country until @NUM1 and then my parents will come and pick me up. Five working days finally come "I can't wait any longer" I shouted . After closing the country, my mom drove me home and I printed "darm @CAPS10! " I said "@CAPS6 yes the site tried to charge our credit card extra so we had to cancel @CAPS10. "@CAPS7 @CAPS5" my mom said "we'll buy you a new one" "@CAPS8" The @CAPS9 scooter finally arrived after three days. "It's time for @CAPS10" I said happily.
Once, when I was @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I had to waste about @NUM1 hours to get on top of the thrill ride. I was patient because it was my first time racing. My dad and I have been fetching water. When we got to the front of the line, I was scared to pee my pants. When we got on the roller coaster, I said I didn't want to go. So my dad asked my son if he could get off the roller coaster and they said you can't get off if you get on. So I had to ride it, and when I did, I wanted to keep it going over and over. Even though it's been @NUM2 rides, it's by far the most anticipated thing in my life. That's when I have to be patient to get what I really want.
Be patient and go to @CAPS1. It passed @NUM1 appointments. So excited to make the ladies wait patiently, doing a lot of achievements and other activities separately. Immediately offering everything, especially the new ones? ? ? Crazy parents yelling "to me and??? You're against the system. I'm going to have to be patient. I'll work all night, in the process??? Rate you @CAPS2. It's gone??? days and All the other stuff in the meat of @LOCATION1. Sit down because such a huge space will be used with @NUM2th, ???
Do you know a patient person? I'm very patient with our kids as my mom. My mom is still cool when I blow my top. All the time, my little brother has made me so angry. But she was almost like that. Even when my grandma died, she kept her cool. Two of my ants just broke through the door. down that week. But they are fine now. Every day things don't get her excited. When my sister makes her angry, she always regrets it. When she made my mom mad, I wanted to punch her because she was mad at me. So you can see my mom treats her patients very well.
My friend is waiting @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad who is busy fixing his @CAPS1. He waited, waited, waited until he fixed it. I would like to know what the problem is. He sat inside, watching the TV and waiting for him to finish. Then my dad was done so my friend asked if we could ride @CAPS1. My dad said yes. My friend is very patient.
Patience is a good thing because if you are, then you are in a tough time in your life. One can do patience by bringing something to the table. They can stay there for three hours instead of being rushed. Some people can't be there for three hours. Some people can't do something for ten mines. These people will give up because of this. But after all those who can and can't can't quit. People were there for an hour and it exploded. Others couldn't do it, but they did. So all you have to do is find something to do when you can't.
"@CAPS1 Are we there yet?" I asked over and over. "@CAPS2 But about the same," he replied. Today we're going on an adventure to @LOCATION1 and I'm so excited! After I asked my @CAPS1 when we were there, about @NUM1 minutes later, we finally arrived at the @LOCATION1 adventure! The line to get tickets was long, but not long. Once we got them, we went looking for a lock to put everything in! The line is not long so we do it so fast! We're all hungry now, so let's go eat! When we entered the restaurant, there was a long line to order! OK, now that we're all done, it's time to ride some great e-rides! "@CAPS3, man!" What do I say when the lines on the rides are super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, well, I had to change clothes to go to the water park to change back or go to the bathroom, and the lines were super long too! Now that the day is almost over, the park will be closed, and my family and I haven't entered the gift shop: we wake up at about @NUM1 minutes. When we were done and ready to check out, the checkout line was not long at all! Finally a long queue! I was a very patient girl that day! Between everything that happened that day!
I am patient when my friends and I are on vacation at @ORGANIZATION1. I had a great time. My family didn't come because they don't like roller coasters. We decided to ride @CAPS1 and it looked like a long wait. After waiting for an hour and a half, it started to rain. It was just a little spill at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides including @CAPS1. We really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour, people left, so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I sat in the front row and had a great time. Worth waiting @NUM1 and a half hours @ORGANIZATION1, we even did it twice.
When I was patient it was @NUM1 grade and I had to wait until this year to play football. I was patient because I waited a long time and did nothing.
Do you know what patience is? Are you patient? Being patient is something you need in your life. I'm going to tell you a little about patience. (@NUM1) Patience is a big deal. We need patience when we go shopping or in the car. You have to be patient when you are in the car because if you don't, you could have an accident. Patience has many qualities. If you're impatient when you're in place, you're going to be annoying. Your impatient people can get really frustrated and annoyed at you when they have long lines or something. (@NUM2) Patience is important. If you have kids and you are impatient, then teach your kids to be impatient. This is not a good thing. As you can see, I've told you as much as I can about patience.
I don't @CAPS7 @CAPS3 dinner when @CAPS3's parents are sick. One night @CAPS3 Dad made ribs for dinner. I don't like @CAPS1's ribs! The smell of @CAPS2 makes me sick! But @CAPS3 Dad loves ribs, so he did it just in time @CAPS1! We sit @CAPS1 to @CAPS7. I ate a potato and @CAPS3 Dad gave me a spoonful of ribs. "I don't @CAPS7," I said. "I hate ribs." @CAPS3 Dad sat patiently at the table waiting for something on my @CAPS7 @CAPS3 plate. "Okay," I said, "I @CAPS4 @CAPS7 got the meat out." I picked up my fork and stirred the chops around looking for meat. After I ate @CAPS1's meat. I said "@CAPS5 I'm done." @CAPS3 Dad laughed at @CAPS3's stubbornness. "Vegetables in @CAPS7." @CAPS3 Dad said. "@CAPS9 @CAPS10! I hate celery!" I whimpered. After a half hour battle of wills @CAPS3 Dad won. I @CAPS2 wanted to get off the table but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating pork chops and left the table. That's when @CAPS3 dad was very patient.
? ? ? One time I was very patient was when I was with my grandparents. We were going on an adventure to @CAPS1 and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldn't be that late. So the next day we arrived at her house at @NUM1 just like she said and we found out she overslept and we all looked at each other because we knew it would take a long time. So I said it's okay, we can wait, we all go into her house and wait until everyone is ready. So as we walked out, I noticed my grandparents were taking care of the suitcases and I said why are you guys carrying my grandma's suitcases, we're going to stay overnight at the hotel so we're closer to the @CAPS1 adventure. So she drove us all back to our house to get ours? ? ? ? ? ? With @NUM2 extra clothes, we're on our way to the hotel ready for our @CAPS1 adventure the next morning. even if we should go
I had to be patient one time, when I went to @LOCATION1 with mom, dad, @CAPS1, sister and grandma. My cousins live at @LOCATION1 so we're going to visit them. We had to drive @NUM1 hours with five people in a small cottage. We had to be patient while the ride was there as we all really got out. When I first found out we were going, I was really happy and I knew I had to be very patient. We had to drive to Dongtian and find a motel. Then we had to drive to around @TIME1, we love @TIME1 my aunt's lake house, my grandmother's sister. So much fun to see them again! But then more patients were on their way home. We were all sad to leave, but we had a great time. The trip home felt shorter than the trip there, but it was still quite long. When we got home, we were each tired of being in the car, but we were glad we didn't have to drive another hour home like my grandma did. That's when I had to endure.
This is a story about my patience. It was at night when suddenly one of the wires in my braces came out of place. It came out of my mouth and there was nothing I could do about it. I had to wait for my mom to come home and be with me, but I was scared, but I was patient. I waited until my mom got there and we had the wires pulled out. there's my stuff, my mom, i'm patient, use l
be patient one day i have to be patient is it on my birthday i am waiting for my dad to give me some money so i can go? ? I waited all day until @NUM1 o'clock and when he finally agreed I got @NUM2 dollars, is it worth it? ? If I wish he wished he might lower the price, so far it would be my fault? The Last Stone Wants My Mom? ? I'm from soccer practice and? ? We waited a while, I was wasted, am I the last? ? those my envelopes? ? I'm under a tree when it's raining and lightning so I don't wear a helmet because it will? Is the etrest lighting in my cage ananelusoin? Infected was your dad showing it? Feeling or acting, she doesn't want someone to rush me until the lack makes them want if it's my cuos my chance to turn twice so if you're that type of situation just don't rush ahead?
What exactly is patience? Patience means waiting peacefully for something. The one time I had to be patient was when I wanted to get my ears pierced. I've tried everything for four years, begging, begging, even cleaning, and it still doesn't work. My mom said I had to be @NUM1 to get my ears pierced. So instead of pissing her off, I sat down and be patient. By doing this, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I had to do was wait until the football game was over to find a place where she would take me. Patience does help in many different ways, and I encourage you to be patient when you want something because it all falls into place.
Patience is hard at times @CAPS5, I had to do this many times. One time in particular changed my life for me. It's my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I waited long and hard every year for this day until it came. I got up early to see @CAPS3 my gift @CAPS5 they didn't. My mom was just watching @CAPS1.V. As if nothing was important, I said to her, "@CAPS2." @CAPS3 She replied, "@CAPS2, why are you up so early?" I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just wait patiently in the room until something happens, @CAPS5 nothing. I ended up going downstairs and playing video games until @NUM1, just waiting for someone to say "Happy Birthday" @CAPS5, nothing. So I just acted like normal until @NUM2: I walked into the basement in the afternoon. Throwing a surprise birthday party for me with gifts, friends and everything. I'm glad I was patient I had a great party and now I am patient every day.
Last time @DATE1 I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. @ORGANIZATION1 is about Kristan rock music. The most prominent part was seeing my favorite Kristen rock band @CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their CDs and it was amazing. Let me be patient with the line that my friend @PERSON1 and I had to wait for the signature. It almost sticks out the gate into the parking lot. Too bad we're almost over. Despite the long wait, the girl behind us was really nice, so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front, the wait was worth it. All the band members are very nice and I gave the lead singer @CAPS3 my lucky bracelet. That's when I'm patient.
Once there were two twin chipmunks named @PERSON1, @PERSON1 always had the patience AJ not so much. One day, the sun was shining and the wind was blowing. AJ decides he wants to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed their camping gear there and headed further into the woods, and it was dusk when they got where they wanted to be. So they tried to make a fire and @LOCATION1 started collecting firewood and trying to make it the way mom and dad taught them. As I said in the first part, @LOCATION1 had no patience so he kept trying but after he stopped he would hit the rock together once and it wouldn't start so @PERSON1 tried it in @NUM1 mins , he started. AJ didn't care, he got the acorns and started cooking. But every time he only leaves them on for @NUM2 seconds, so he tried and tried, and in the end he just stopped @PERSON1 nicely for @NUM2 minutes, @LOCATION1 is really pissed off right now, so they go to bed. When @PERSON1 wakes up in the morning, he finds @LOCATION1 making breakfast. AJ finally learned to be patient.
My head is in the sky. That'smine. The ticket I've been craving is actually mine. I plan to watch @ORGANIZATION1 for three days and break @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing is bad. @NUM1 days until the concert. So fast, but so far. For three days (no fun!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I don't want to annoy my dad, after all he just spends a lot of money on me! After three days, I was fine. I still assure myself that I won't break the no-complaining rule. I don't know if this week has gone by fast or slow. I just know I can't wait any longer. Soon, it's @DATE1, two of my favorite bands and a band I almost equally like is called Flipleaf, tonight at @LOCATION1. Days passed by. I want to explode with excitement. All I can think about is what will happen later today. My heart was beating every second until I got into my dad's car at @NUM2. Cool clothes, cracks, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days without complaining? Check! We listened to three bands all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart was back to normal, but with every beat of life they heard louder and louder, almost in time to the pounding of their bass drum. Passing a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer who broke @CAPS1. (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. As we entered @LOCATION1, I saw the limousine. Less than ten minutes later, we pulled into the parking lot of @PERSON1. I caught a glimpse of people lining up to get in. I reached into the bottle of patience and pulled from the little bits I had left. The giant tunnel lines are grey and deras. We had to walk a mile to get to the end of the line, if ???? snails, but before I knew it, I was in. I haven't complained yet. I am proud of my patience.
One day, I was really patient. I'm a baby and everything was fine until the kids started fighting! Of course my two brothers. They were kicking and the youngest biting; so I told them to stop. They did it for a while, then started playing with the toys again. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stopped until my brother @PERSON1 started copying everything everyone said so I said stop or you'll go to your room. So he stopped and everyone was doing fine until Mom and Dad got home and things are completely different now. So that was when I had patience with my little siblings.
The time when I was very patient was last year. My aunt said she was going to take me to the basketball game. So the next day she woke up early when I woke up. My aunt never told me when she was coming. So I'm ready at @NUM1 am. So I called her at @NUM2 and she didn't answer. So I'm just watching TV and playing my games. Then around @NUM3 pm, my auntie called back and said she had to go to the store. So now my troubles are starting to build up. I want to call her back and ask her some questions like where are you going and how long are you going to be away. But I try to be patient. Now at @NUM4, my mom says let's go! Now I'm really pissed off because I didn't expect to leave with my mom. So my mom and I got home around @NUM5 pm. Now I'm really pissed off because she hasn't even called since we left. So I called her and she said she came down the street. I was happy, so later that day, I had a great time with my cousins and auntie.
"@CAPS1, @CAPS5 When are we opening the presents?" I asked. "@CAPS2 We're back from church," she replied. This is our typical @DATE1 plan, making @CAPS3 eve dinners throughout the day, attending @CAPS3 eve services, having grandparents for dinner instead of all the kids opening one present, then going to bed for about an hour, then opening more presents . Amen, "Our pastor ends service" @CAPS5, we're leaving now, @CAPS1? " I cried "@CAPS6", she said. @CAPS8 We had dinner and I felt like I had ants in my pants and I was so excited. Time seemed to pass so slowly, I was only NUM1 before my grandparents left Years old. Finally, we all gathered around the @CAPS3 tree @CAPS8 and I was about to open my present. It was just a sleeping bag, more than my dad said, "You guys @CAPS5 are sleeping on the floor in the @LOCATION1 room, but definitely To go to bed. " @CAPS8 I was lying on the floor while my sister fell asleep and I was thinking, I wonder what I'm going to get @CAPS3. I finally fell asleep. The next morning @NUM2. I jumped out of bed and threw my sister Wake up and run into the parents room to wake them up. I was thinking we could finally open the presents. That was when I had to be very patient. But it all paid off in the end.
Patience is about whaiting and having the staff you want, if i don't want anything Patience is what you have to get before you get it. Being so patient means you have to do it with a good attitude
Once I took the test, it was really long. I finished it early. My friend and I waited a long time. They gave us two and a half hours to test. I finished the prep in an hour and a half. My friend did it in five minutes for me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember to bring something to do while you're patient. If you have nothing to do, just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.
One day I asked my parents if they could buy this game I want and this game I want, and they asked me how much? I said I don't know how much. So he said let's go to the store and see how much it costs. When we got there we found it was @MONEY2 and I said I could buy it and he said maybe after a while I started begging and he still said @CAPS1! When I got home I went to bed the next morning and I was at home watching @CAPS2.V and I saw the game commercially and it said the game was still @MONEY1 so me? ? ? . When we went to the mall I saw it was @MONEY3 so I finally bought it.
Everyone has patience once in their life. I remember when I was ten, one day I was every patient. It's all because of the popcorn. A tiny popcorn coughed in my ear. It was a harrowing day, but I was patient. One day about two years ago, when I was ten, I swallowed a piece of popcorn after going to the movies. I remember eating the last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box and throwing the box away. Well, it started bothering me when I walked out the door and ate my popcorn. My mom and I woke up at a nearby target to get some supplies and run some errands. I'm starting to get really thirsty because of the popcorn. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because I was thirsty, but she said she only had a credit card. That means she can rely on her stuff, but she can't buy pop music. I understand. So I just try not to think about it. It's very difficult. Soon we came to the next task, the bank. My mom needs some money to pay for my tennis coach. I asked her if she could hurry because the popcorn and thirst were making me sad. She said she was walking as fast as she could and we were only minutes away from home. I know we're more like fifteen minutes away than us, not just minutes, but I'm not arguing. The longing and longing in the heart began to hit. It felt like three hours had passed, but it was only fifteen minutes when we finally got home. I pushed open the door and ran in to get water. I ran over, opened the fridge, opened a bottle of water, and took the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom get supplies and stuff, then laughed and drank more water. In conclusion, we all learn to be patient sometimes. I patiently went home to drink some water. I'm always patient and I'm always happy when it pays off.
I've only really needed patience a few times in my life, but the one I remember the most is when I was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting in our terminal for our flight to @LOCATION2. When @CAPS2 heard the announcement, @CAPS2 had been waiting about @NUM1 minutes. "@CAPS1 had a problem with the plane, but @CAPS5 should have it fixed in about an hour." @CAPS2 eventually discovered that the rear door had been hit so hard that one of its components was damaged. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. The one hour wait sounds ok. But @CAPS6 has another announcement "I'm sorry, but @CAPS2 can't get that part right away. Waiting time is at least @NUM2 hours." @CAPS3 Sounds worse, but I'm keeping my cool. My mom was horrified. Three hours have passed. @CAPS6 Four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4. My laptop and iPod are dead so I'm just fiddling with my fingers. @CAPS6 @CAPS2 Heard "@CAPS5 Turns out @CAPS2 won't get parts until tomorrow morning." @CAPS6 A big "uh uh" swept the terminal. But luckily @CAPS2 got a free night before the flight. Tired of waiting, but @CAPS2 has patience, so @CAPS2 passed @CAPS5.
There was a lot of drama around our team when I was cheering a few days ago, it was fifteen days before the game and everyone was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coach that no one understood what we were supposed to do. In our second formation the side I was on for pom cutine was not on the diagnostic line where we should be and didn't get to the kick line in time because the other side was pushing us so we had to go further Far. They did it. @LOCATION1 (one of our coach daughters) yelled next to me because I didn't get to the kick line in time, even though she was pushing our dad down so we couldn't get there, then she started yelling at @PERSON1 Yell, say this and @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1: "@LOCATION1 don't blame anyone else for not being perfect at anything, and yours pushed us down so we can't get to the finish line in time." @LOCATION1 Not sure what to say, but she said "@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! That's not true." Even though you can tell she knows it's true because next time we do baseboards, she's not close to the center, Instead moving further, @PERSON3 didn't really get to her spot on time, but a few seconds later when she should have. I think @PERSON2 is loyal to @PERSON1, even though @PERSON1 may not be one of her best friends, they are still friends, just not the best of friends.
When I'm patient is when I want to go out and my sister wants to go out, but she's not ready. She had to get her hair done and get some clothes on. I waited patiently and said nothing. I didn't want to, but I did. I wanted to go out and my sister wanted to go too, so I was waiting for her. I quietly walked out the door, then my sister yelled that I wanted to wait. I went back to the house and waited for her to find some clothes first, and she went upstairs to find some. She got dressed and then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and found them in the corner. So we were about to go out and I said girl what happened to your Hal. She touched her head and said I forgot. So we went back to the house and I tried putting her hair in a ponytail and it didn't fit. So I asked her to do something and she couldn't. So I parted her hair in two ponytails. Then we went out. That's when I was waiting for my sister.
When I was about to leave my uncle's ranch. I wait patiently for my dad to come back so he can help my brother put the @NUM1 on the test car. It's been @NUM2 hours and my dad hasn't come back. I had a hard time getting my @NUM3 off my test bike because it was so heavy and my dad was still riding his @NUM3. When my dad came back, my brother went to ride his @NUM3. It was hard for me to get everything and leave, but in the end my mom and sister wanted to leave, so they finally helped me.
This is @DATE1, @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I went down the street for the carnival they were having. When we got there it was running and one of the rides was open. So we sat there until they all opened the doors. We all went on, but I won't go on. It's called freak out. The lights flickered and the music was loud. We were in line, but I went out. @CAPS4 said "Why didn't you stand in line?" "I'm scared." "But I want to continue." "@CAPS1 You're late?" I said. We waited an hour. I was sitting on the bench and @CAPS4 said, "@CAPS1 we keep riding?" "@CAPS2 we @CAPS1" My heart was pounding, I could hear it. That's when @CAPS4 said "I @CAPS1 wait". "@CAPS3 let it end." @CAPS4 glad to wait until I'm ready to continue. In short, my cousin is the best to wait. On the plus side, I love that ride now.
Did you have patience before? Well, I'm sitting in a warm and comfortable seat, dozing from exhaustion, waiting for them to say @PERSON1 is coming. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1 have been running around in my head, but nothing happened, so I just sat there patiently and waited. My mom sat next to me reading an Avon magazine she picked up from a small log table in the center of the orthodontic clinic. I've been asking myself things like I wonder what they're going to do today, I wonder if I'm going to take off my dilators or what about my top stent. Then I started staring at the office ladies typing on the computer. The sound of metal tools rang in my ears, from the back room. A girl came out "@CAPS1" and I was both excited and nervous, but proud because I've been sitting there patiently.
'Patience' @CAPS1 On the way to the big city to see a very special baseball game. Can you guess what I'm playing? It's "@LOCATION1 Tiger", @CAPS2 is @CAPS3 Stadium, "@CAPS1 is super excited, this is the first time @CAPS1 is at @LOCATION1." How long will it take for @CAPS5 to @CAPS1 get there? I asked. " About @NUM1 hours, why?" My mom replayed "Because four hours here is so boring." "I know, but you have to be patient." "@CAPS6." I guess my bad. "Can I be patient with @CAPS5? I just thought about it for a while. Then a minute, then boom! I'm cold: I slept for two hours. Then I woke up in traffic @CAPS1. I asked" Is @CAPS1 still there", "hope" my dad said. So I just sat there and waited. About @NUM2 minutes later I asked @CAPS1 if I could turn on the radio. "@CAPS7" my mom said. @CAPS1 is there Sit about @NUM3 inches. And then @CAPS1 finally got my hands dirty and not mad what I'll do when I start racing. I'm thinking maybe I'll spend some money, but when I think about anything else, I'm would be "here! " "@CAPS7! " I was sneaking. So @CAPS1 left and walked about @NUM4 miles to the ticket booth. When @CAPS1 came up, I was like "Just need to be patient I guess."
Two weeks simi means my family goes to siyflags for the fright festival. The line will be long, I will never be patient, I hate being patient. We went to @LOCATION1 city @CAPS1 first line only ten minutes. And then there's Superman, that's a little longer. My sister and I were allowed to leave and continue to mature. Then there was the perisa wooden coaster, we waited many times @NUM1 minutes between stops. We've finally gotten to where we're at the cost people that keep popping up with these flash passes. Fast Passes bring you to the front of the line. When we finally got to the front of the line, my patient was @CAPS2. The roller was off track. That's a @NUM2 mile cost, but a tur one. That's when I'm patient.
One day last year I had to be very patient when my mom told the family we would be going to Six Flags soon. I was full of excitement and I couldn't wait so I asked her when and she said she didn't know yet. It frustrates me because last time she said she was going somewhere and we ended up not going. The only thing I'm sure about is that it has to be on @DATE1 because she's working during the week and I'm glad school is finally out so I don't have to worry about homework. So I waited until @DATE2 and asked my mom if we could go to @DATE1. She said no because we have to plan more and we can't pick @DATE1 at will. @DATE1 I was harassing her every day until she finally started planning. The first thing she does is check her work schedule to make sure. She doesn't have any meetings or projects for the upcoming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me she had things to do, so she kept looking at her schedule. Her next free @DATE1 is in two weeks. I'm happy with that though, because it's better than nothing. For the next two weeks, I saved up for Six Flags. When the two weeks finally came to an end, I had about @MONEY1 saved and I almost bounced off the wall because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I've ever had.
Patience is waiting to do what you want without complaining. As I mail outdoors with my mom, two sisters, brother, niece, and dog, I wait patiently to try the iPad at the @ORGANIZATION1 store. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After class, we went to buy ice cream. My little brother got the root beer flavored smoothie, my niece, the dog, I got the vanilla ice cream. After eating the ice cream, I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise! Then we go home!
One time @PERSON1 had the patience was @CAPS1 and I taught him how to pitch. @PERSON1 easily developed a nice finish and delivery, but the arin angle is closed. But that didn't stop him. @CAPS1 asked if he wanted to stop, but @PERSON1 said "no!" @CAPS2 Time went on and @PERSON1 started getting better. He likes to throw @NUM1 mph fasiball at a catcher now. He wasn't accurate that day, he didn't give, he kept trying, didn't drink. @PERSON1 is now the No. 2 starter in the rotation. Thanks to some seltons for your patience.
"@CAPS1 is @CAPS3! It will be here soon, don't worry," @CAPS2 said. A patient person will go through hardship without complaint. Well, these days (which feels like a downside) I haven't been a so-called "@CAPS3" guy. Halloween is coming up in a few days and my costume still hasn't arrived. I've been waiting, but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fifth time I watched the little red hand on the clock go round and round. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didn't. "I've been sitting here since ten, where is the @CAPS4 track!" I screamed. Then I glanced at the clock @NUM1. what! It feels like an hour! How could someone endure it for so long! "@CAPS5 is coming" I said to myself. A few hours later, I saw a white @CAPS6-@CAPS7 truck wandering down the street. (@CAPS8 does that!) @CAPS9 stares. No, it has been in the past. I sighed and dragged myself down the steps. " @CAPS10!" I sobbed in pain, "Why does this feeling eat me up like this?" I strolled to the kitchen, where a brown box lay on the counter. I felt dizzy as I sneaked huge strides towards it. "@CAPS5 is here! @CAPS5 is here!" I yelled as I jumped up and down. At last!
One of the many times I've been patient is when my @CAPS1, my @CAPS2 and I go to a restaurant. We ordered food and found a table. We sat there waiting for food. I asked my @CAPS1 "How long does @CAPS3 take?" @CAPS4 said "You have to be a waiter and a waiter". Then shortly after our food was done. It's totally worth it.
I had patience about three or four times; it was when I was five, it was my birthday, and it was when my grandmother bought me something and I had to wait patiently for her to come back with my gifts. The other time was when I was @NUM1 and it was @CAPS1 day and I woke up early, ready to be patient, again waiting for my dad to wake up so I could open my presents. Another time was when my friend had to do something, so I had to wait patiently again until he came back. This will end my dissertation.
One time I was a patient was when @CAPS4 went to @LOCATION1 "Mom!" I exclaimed. "@CAPS1's going I'm leaving my pack and ready." @CAPS2 Mom and I pack everyone's things at home. It's a beautiful heartwarming @DATE1 at @LOCATION2 and it's also @CAPS2's stepfather's birthday. "@CAPS3 you need to be patient ok, @CAPS4 has a long drive and you have everything you need." @CAPS5 got me there. I gotta, coloring materials, portable @CAPS6 players, etc…. I have @CAPS7 @CAPS8 what else @CAPS4 until needed @CAPS2 stomach growling, sounds like a bear protecting its cub, fierce, starving. Then I remembered, Ding, I wanted to head over to @CAPS2, food that's what I needed to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a racing car trying to win a race. I pack turkey sandwiches, PB&J sandwiches, fries. Saltandvinager, Sour Kelin and Onion (CAROSS) and jolepenyo ceddar (YUM). Now I have everything I thought "the @CAPS4 go." @CAPS9 @CAPS2 mom and I again rushed out the door "to get the address, ask:" @CAPS2 dad. "@CAPS10 @CAPS3 I got it." @CAPS11 Sister fell asleep when @CAPS4 started going @CAPS2. @CAPS5 sleeping lik arock the whole way there though, I don't think rocky shore. After @NUM1 hours in the car to stay awake I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitement rushed over so fast I could feel it and then I fell asleep. I think I'm able to stay awake the whole way, but it's impossible with my characteristics. At the end, @CAPS2 step father yelled "Wake up!" I was so tierd when I woke up, "was @CAPS4 to that step, the first thing that came out of @CAPS2's mouth was 'Yeah', of course, I First thing to do is jump up and take care!" @CAPS12! "@CAPS2 Mom called me to pause as if I was in a video game and the player pressed pause for a character sculpt." @CAPS13 Takes some broken bags. "'@CAPS14' my face with @CAPS2. '@CAPS15 splurge be patient' as I took the bag scowse said it was the @CAPS2 dream of the apartment and the first thing I did was sleep.
Patience isn't always easy, in fact last year was the year I had to spend @NUM2 hours in the car with @NUM1 rude, screaming and crying kids. Last year I was so excited to see my great @CAPS3 davn in ? ? ? . and my grandpa. My @CAPS1 dad is a fan and @CAPS2 came later than I found out my @NUM1 cousins. It will be a long drive. We packed our stuff in the car. I brought my ipod and a book, @CAPS2 my cousin brought? ? ? They're just noisy and fluffy toys for rides. As we started heading to @LOCATION1, I turned on my ipod and found it only had @PERCENT1 battery left. Halfway through, I'm pretty much borden's dad, and the @CAPS2 kids are just settling in. When I was sure they were asleep, I decided to join them. wack! All I heard was a sober slap, my cousin echoed "here" and I finally said to myself as I still woke up with a sore and stiff neck. About @NUM4 hours after we visited my @CAPS3 and my cousins were all asleep again, I knew it was going to be a great trip home.
One day I was patient, I was fine, the girl was so enthusiastic because she pushed me, hit me, so she got on my nrvise. So I just had her in front of me and we at @CAPS1 and a lot of people were ready to meet @CAPS1 Ms. said stop pushing her. Then we were in class, so I raised my hand and she said be patient with me.
I'm going to write down the time I have the patience for. One day, after my family and I came back from church, I asked my room if she could make breakfast, but she didn't answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma, who talks a lot. It's so organized. For example, I kept pacing back and forth, but then I just sat down. After an hour of patience, my mom and grandma said goodbye, hung up, and I finally had breakfast.
One day, around @NUM1. My mom woke me up and my brother and dad got ready I don't know what we got ready but we hit the road as soon as the clouds were over. When we were up high, I fell back in the car and slept. I woke up from a big @CAPS1 on my break and when I looked up we were in a long line of cars, "Where are we?" I asked "Six Flags". @CAPS2 my brother. I could hear people around me getting impatient. When people tried to pay to enter the park, they thought screaming and yelling. Looks like we're moving faster than @CAPS3 in the fast people, we were one of the first to get in. That's the impatient bunch of @CAPS3 I've seen.
Pg @NUM1: @CAPS1 she cried! I just want to get out of the car and walk home. We @NUM2 people are in a suburb and we are all messed up! So we can't use our arms anymore and I feel like I'm locked in jail with chains. In the morning @NUM3 o'clock I saw a big sign saying Welcome to @CAPS2. So at that point we only had an hour or so left, and I was super excited. We finally reached our destination key wrapping. This was the longest trip of my life! But I tried my best to be patient. But in the long run, I realize I'm not, I have waves and @NUM4° @CAPS3 degrees all weekend. When I think about how long it will take to get here, I don't even want to think about how long it will take to get home! But how do I know I have a patient going home!
It was yesterday when I was patient. I just finished the @NUM1 part of the rest and I'm so anxious I want to get up and move around a bit more, but I'm taking @CAPS1 so I can't. Instead, I entertained myself in any way I could, like pretending the singer repeatedly wrote running songs in my head, or even playing with my thumbs! So in the end she let us talk. I'm sitting next to some of my friends so I'm just talking to them. Somehow we started talking about dungeons and dragons and they kept asking me what classes they would be and what they would be. Anyway, I kept trying to talk but I kept getting interrupted so I just relaxed and waited for my turn. It was finally my turn to speak, but we had to go to lunch so I never said what I meant. This is when I have patience.
Do you ever get sick of being told to be patient all the time? I have, @CAPS1 will tell you my patience. Once I was on my way to @LOCATION1 and flying wasn't as bad as @CAPS1 told you. When @CAPS3 reaches @PERSON1 @CAPS3 has to pass the @PERSON1@NUM1 boundary, it's hot! ! ! I think the temperature reached @NUM2? @CAPS3 had to wait in this small room with about @NUM3 people who didn't have aircon we were all waiting for the bus to come @NUM4 hours later. @CAPS3 is getting on the bus, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 missed that bus as about @NUM5 people barged in ahead. Then @CAPS3 waits for the bus again, after @NUM6 hours the bus arrives again at @CAPS2 trying to get on, then @CAPS3 is pushed away again. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Missed the bus @CAPS2 my family that I was bemused by @CAPS2. Another thing I'm frustrated with is the thousands of flies everywhere. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 After waiting @NUM4+ hours a bus arrived but my little brother was in the bathroom @CAPS2 @CAPS3 missed that bus @CAPS2 my mom told me to calm down and be patient @CAPS2 I've been patiently waiting for the @NUM8 bus to come and @CAPS3 to pick up but the bus doesn't go to @CAPS3 Assuming @CAPS2 @CAPS3 has to go back to the same place where @CAPS3 was but again my mom said be patient. A police officer at the scene saw how long @CAPS3 waited for @CAPS2 after the next bus arrived in @NUM9 hours @NUM10 minutes, he lifted the others up for me and my family to get in and told The driver "took them there," @CAPS2 @CAPS3 has a bus to our own, you know it's all worth it.
There was a time when I had to wait to deal with my personal possession of it. My sisters and I walked into the house and one of them went to handle the personal belongings there and I was patiently keeping you from knocking on the door. Whatever they do, tell her (@ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS1) to @CAPS3. By the way, @ORGANIZATION1 is @NUM1 years old and @CAPS1 is @NUM2 years old. Waited and waited, be patient, don't be on "@CAPS3 up", @CAPS4 I really have to deal with my personal possession "??? something like that. Being very patient with them makes them feel like an impatient person It's good because think if you really have to deal with something in the bathroom or toilet, people will think you're a rush person??? instead of being patient. When they're just talking about anything, they're going to be with him in any way / Anyone she knows talks about it. In the end this is not a time to wait for others to be patient.
Patience @MONTH1 It looks easy, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1, etc. take patience. Just like when I was in @NUM1 grade, everyone, regardless of age, has patience. Every day I wonder if it was a dream or a nightmare. When I was in @NUM1 grade, I wanted something every day that would change my life forever. After @NUM3 years, that wish has finally come true. I am very patiently waiting for our letter to be approved or rejected. Before I knew it, my mom, dad and I got on a non-stop flight to China. There we'll see the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and @LOCATION1, not to mention our main purpose of adopting our little sister. I don't know what I'm doing. I waited patiently for @NUM4 weeks and then we went to the lobby where she and her caregivers and all the other families were waiting for their baby. I can't believe we are the @NUM5 people who have received gifts from China. Big @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her away, she started warning, pinching, kicking, who knows what else. After more than an hour, she calmed down, she played with her toys and stuff. We went out to eat at @ORGANIZATION1 that night. My dad ordered a milkshake and he made her? ? ? Some of them are also @CAPS2. He didn't bring it back until the cup was empty. We soon learned that she was going to be an up-and-down roller coaster. She likes cake and ice cream and just wants Dad. This is Dad's dream come true. In conclusion, you use patience every day, no matter how big or small. Patience will play a role in your life, no matter how tough it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, "Can you use it?"
One person I know that's patient is my dad, he's very patient, like once when we were driving by at mc donalds, as soon as we got in the car, the lady was like a second, but she? Sitting there for @NUM1 minutes, I see like going out? ? ? Then went to the restaurant to order my food but my dad just sat there adjusting the gas until the lady came back and I was pissed the lady let us sit there for @NUM2 minutes but then I was happy because I got My food. Then, when we put off, my dad said, that's why the sick got it? ? ? And my double chess barge and my big iced tea with chocolate chip cookies, my dad taught me one? ? ? class? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Only drama and not happiness.
I had to be patient when I had to wait in line to shoot @CAPS1 at @CAPS2 point. The first @CAPS2 point was fun, but we had to wait in line for about half an hour for patients. Some people keep leaving because the wait time is too long. If I want to ride, I have to be patient. Second, I quit riding the rollar coster, so I kept lining up. It's a little hard to be patient when people push and cut, but it's worth it when I ride. As you can see, it's good to be patient sometimes, but it's worth it when you're doing something fun. You just have to stay calm and patient when people push you.
I've been patient until my birthday, then when I get a gift, I don't need patience anymore because I waited a year for a gift, then I waited @CAPS1 because it's far from me Only a month away from birthdays this year and I'll be patient @CAPS1 because I already know what I'm getting. But that's what I have patience with, and I have almost nothing else.
Patience means understanding and tolerance. I, like many others, have a hard time gaining patience. Some people are born with patience. Those who find it easy to wait even for fans of your favorite book series of the night. The "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" clock is taunting me slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 hasn't come back I don't know. It was a very bad thing that I knew it would happen that night. This must be the heat I can't stand because @CAPS10 or @CAPS4 only go five quick muinets when the door slams shut. I don't believe her, but we climbed into the car and drove down the twisty road. We have timed our rides perfectly to see red lights, traffic lights at every red light. It's like the light is mad at us. We're also stuck behind every slow person, bypassing their way with @CAPS3. Just as I was screaming inside, we saw the green light and pulled into @LOCATION1. Coming to @CAPS8 is a bookstore, and @CAPS8's unease becomes even more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like on a trampoline and stopped the moment I saw the line in front of us. "@CAPS3!" I yelled, "I'm running out of patience for this monster queue. It's like the whole town is pissing me off as much as I can. I'm dragging lawn chairs from my van and waiting in line. Turn over Card" I fell on the black chair and waited. It's going to be a long night. "@NUM1 miners until midnight" @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explained to me "that's not possible" I told her. "You can do it." @CAPS4 is right, @NUM1 minute wait is not that long. I breathed in the smell of coffee coming from inside and listened to the people talking. @NUM1 The minuet was coming to an end soon and I had the patience for the first time that night. “@CAPS5 fasten your seat belts, I open the last book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen 'how to end' @CAPS8's mind is full of questions. "@CAPS9 wait is so bad" @CAPS10 Asked. "I guess not" I replied embarrassedly. "Patience pays off" @CAPS10 talk. I didn't answer I was already reading Minuet a mile. I learned that patience does pay off and not complaining makes life Made it easier. Patience is understanding and @CAPS9, I got a little better on patience and things are going to be a lot better.
I was patient one time because the teacher had to tell me something. So I fetched water at the door, but then she had to go to the office, so I had to fetch water. When the teacher came back, she told me thank you for your patience. Patient really means you can wait. Some kids get impatient, for example, we have @NUM1 kids in a group we're playing games and they get so because they don't get called lol. But the game is random, you choose the stick and whoever sticks to it is gone. So being a patient means you have to be able to wait.
Patience is something or someone likes to wait for someone or something Patience is a part of life I sometimes have no patience but I should have patience without patience you won't get it because you have to want something that's why you should have patience.
"Come on @CAPS1!" I yelled as I ran to the door of @CAPS2 @CAPS3. "@CAPS4 One minute, you're going to use @CAPS4 for your friends," my mom said. When I stopped @CAPS4 for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1 and @CAPS5's brother @PERSON2, I started kicking rocks to get me something to do. Once they finally caught up with me, we walked into the huge theme park. "@CAPS1 to top @CAPS7 @CAPS8", I said impatiently. "@CAPS9, we can go on, but I'm staying behind with @PERSON1," my mom said. "@CAPS10 because me and @PERSON3 are going to the front row!", @PERSON2 shouted. When we started walking down the line, it said we needed @NUM1 minutes @CAPS4. After lining up, I thought to myself, wow, what a long line. It wasn't long before we finally got on the roller coaster. "@CAPS11!", the belt rang as we all got on the roller coaster. "@CAPS12!", everyone said as we took off. After that, I told myself I could be patient.
@PERSON2 and I went to slove. @CAPS1 is picking up some swamp alcohol and chocolate to be human. @CAPS1 walking? ? ? At 6am, @CAPS1 met a large group of people wishing to see goodbye to something to smile. So @PERSON2 and I line up. @CAPS1 sat there for at least 50 minutes waiting for marshmallows and chocolates; but @CAPS1 put out two-mash mellows and two chocolate packets. I asked her "@PERSON2 why you have two!" @CAPS1 said while I waited, they were getting rid of them, so they gave me two of the same one. I laughed, we? ? ? Thanks! When we got back to the car we told @CAPS2 another sister "@PERSON1" we got two @NUM1 said? ? ? " @CAPS2 sister snickered we got back to @PERSON2's car, but the bag in the trunk was another? Cries were then off. We got home, @PERSON1 ate three, I ate two, @ PERSON2 ate five @CAPS1??? Us. Thank you.
Today I' @CAPS3 going to write about a very patient friend of mine. My friend's name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 was so patient, when I told her to wait, I came back an hour later and she was still there, absolutely the most patient and awesome girl I know! In tests (like @CAPS3.EAP), she always takes her time. She uses her time wisely (haha, her last name is @CAPS2). At @ORGANIZATION1, she doesn't stand in long lines for corn dogs. Now I @CAPS3 start to think that @CAPS1 likes to wait. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesn't mind waiting for me when I have to do something.
Experts who are patient and forgiving as you understand will come up with different allies without complaining. I'll tell you I'm patient once. “I’m going to tell your mom you broke the hole in the wall” @CAPS1 you don’t tell me this” @CAPS2 shouted. This is an example of blackmail for one of the many things you have to be patient with in life. @CAPS2 is A 6 year old girl and I'm a baby. She was at my house one day and we were playing a game that involved kicking the shower against the wall. Man, it's my turn and I kicked the victim against the wall. My mom came back Home and I told the boys she killed me. But one thing I had to do was that thair was a witness. Six year old who wouldn't keep a secret. I told him not to tell my mom because @CAPS1 I'll be in big trouble if she does, she won't come over again. We went to the store and she discovered the glory of the black mail, she said she'd tell my mom @CAPS1 I didn't buy her ice cream. I'm @ NUM1? F days. I refused to buy her ice cream, so she told my mom that my mom didn't care.
After the first dance, applause resounded throughout the building. I repeat the routine for the third time backstage with my dance team. The backstage was cold and stuffy, and I was sweating as soon as I practiced! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, I was wrong. I quickly found out that we were the last to perform, at least five hours. "@CAPS1 Are there more dances?" and "What are we dancing?" @CAPS2 What is everyone thinking or saying. Every hour feels like a day! I have a lot of emotions in excitement, boredom and nervousness. Then finally it was our turn to take the stage. After waiting so long, it's finally our turn and I'm relieved! I did spins, jumps and jumps and had so much fun! I had a wonderful time dancing. Great things require patience!
One boring old rainy afternoon, I asked my mom to take me to a place called Modern, if you don't know what that is, I'll tell you. Modern is a place I like it. It has everything I like, a park money and tree stuff. I went there with my mom and I told her she didn't have to stay, but she insisted. So she watched me skate for @NUM1 hours, watched me cheer me on, and even bought me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met.
Patience @CAPS4 is a great trait. When you are patient, you are respected. @CAPS4 Why I have a lot of respect for teacher @CAPS7. @PERSON1. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 A very patient person. If you don't understand something, she will work with you until you understand it. It may even take a few weeks. Once she taught us how to add negative numbers, which I didn't understand, and she worked with me until I understood. She is very patient. Let me tell you what happened. "@CAPS1 today we're going to add a negative C" @CAPS2 @CAPS4 would be a breeze, I silently thought to myself. I hardly know what to do at all, @CAPS7 teacher has to be very patient with me. By the time the @CAPS7 teacher finished explaining the rules for adding negative numbers, I was lost "@CAPS3 are some sample questions everyone needs to try," said @CAPS7 teacher. After a few minutes, she went to each student and checked the answers there. She had a worried look on her face when she came to me. "@CAPS4 all is well, you didn't do your sample question" she asked me. "I don't understand @CAPS2" I replied. @CAPS7 The teacher was silent for a moment, then she said "see me after class" @CAPS5 I waited until the end of the day to see her. "I noticed you had a math problem today" @CAPS7 teacher said. "@CAPS6 will fix this." Teacher @CAPS7 sat down with me and explained step by step what to do. About twenty minutes after she explained to me how to do it, I finally started to embrace it. @NUM1 minutes later I started doing this. "You can go" said @CAPS7 teacher. "You know it better than other students now." "Thanks @CAPS5 for being patient with me," I said before leaving. @CAPS7 teacher just smiled. That's when @CAPS7 teacher was very patient with me. I'm glad she is
Whistle, whistle, that's the sound of a football referee blowing his whistle. (I'm on the defensive.) @CAPS1 called my name and let me go. When I got off, I picked up my water bottle and sat on the sub until at the end I asked my instructor if I could go in. His answer was that you just got out of the car. In my head, I was thinking I've been gone for almost ten minutes, how could I have just left. So I waited a few more minutes to ask. When he finally let me play. When I came on, I realized I was on the side and the ball barely touched the entire game. I played for about five minutes and then got knocked out again. This time I sat on the bench longer. I am losing my patients. I asked my coach if I could go back and he said yes. After the game, I realized why my coach had me so much in the game because he loved the @LOCATION1 Wolverines and I had a state tattoo on my face. This is when I have patience.
This is when I have patience. Once I was patient and my mom went and bought me a new pair of shoes. My mom bought me a new pair of shoes because I haven't had a new pair in months. I'm patient and my mom will buy me a new pair of shoes. I know when my mom has money and I need some new stuff she gets. I wait patiently for my mother. I am confident that my mother will help me buy shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door, I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there in my new shoes.
The real @CAPS3 is one of the fastest runners in @LOCATION1. No one could catch him and beat him in a match, or even sneak up on him. This made him impatient. Even when his friends and family talked to him, it was their way of pleading with him. "@CAPS1...@CAPS2...@CAPS3...@CAPS4...is...what are you...doing?" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Angry at the fact that no one is as fast as him. So he ran away. He escaped. He ran as fast as he could. He's only spent @NUM1 minutes and he's already at @LOCATION2. In @LOCATION2 he said people don't walk and as fast as possible. But that wasn't the case when his team spoke to them. sure where i can find the element @CAPS6? ” @CAPS7 responded. “@CAPS8…ch….first…eh….you….turn….eh….best…ch” @CAPS9 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 screamed that he had to believe no one was faster than him. So he Just be patient
Ah patient, I know a lot of people have a hard time being patient for me to tell you a story about my patience. I remember last year when I @NUM1 @CAPS1 went to @CAPS2 to go fishing for a week with a two hour drive, I literally left @CAPS1 at exactly 6am that morning and I was happier than the lack of this trip @CAPS1 hit the night . I'm ready to go out, I'm so excited, my dad said "don't worry, @CAPS1 will be here soon, let's calm down, alright man" and I just gave up the rest. Waiting there to see what our camp looks like, patiently waiting for @CAPS1 to finally get there, that's when I @CAPS4 patiently wait.
@PERSON1 is a little boy with a squirrel bladder lining up for the toilet at Super @CAPS1. @PERSON1 said to himself, "Patience, good things always come from patience". So he waited for his turn. @PERSON1 is in the middle of the team behind five. @PERSON1 is the head of six people who are all doing a piss dance. He learned manners at school, so he let six people walk in front of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and found a hundred dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knows the finder breeder better than polite, so he accepts. @PERSON1 learned that being polite and patient is the right thing to do, and sometimes it pays off.
The one time I had patience was when I was hanging out at school with three other friends one day. We were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile. Since it is a relay race, one person runs a mile, the second person finishes the first person, the third person finishes the second person finishes the mile, and finally the third person finishes the mile and I run for a mile, Because I run a mile the fastest. Because I had to wait till the end, I had to be patient and finally go.
Patience is not available to all of us. Learning a subject is hard, but mastering a subject is even harder. Now is a good time to use patience.
I brought some friends with me when I went to the @CAPS1 conly @ORGANIZATION2 youth group at church. In the maze, we have to enter a group of @ORGANIZATION1 as a group of @CAPS2 with me, my father, @PERSON1 and @CAPS3, with @CAPS4 behind us. Halfway through @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2 a guy surrounded us with a chainsaw and then @PERSON1 hit my glass so we had to block @ORGANIZATION2 from @ORGANIZATION2 so we could find them right before we found them My friends in the @CAPS6 group came and had to wait @NUM1 minutes, which seems like a long time. So they have no chance of being overtaken by the guy with the chainsaw.
My story about patience is that I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes to get on "@CAPS1 of @CAPS2" which is really cool. The first thing I do when I'm in line is try to talk to people because I know I'll be in line for a while. I said hi to the couple in front of me and we chatted for a while and it turned out they were coming down south from @PERSON1, @LOCATION1 which is really close to @LOCATION2 where I live, looks weird in @LOCATION3 and Met people who live across from our town and then time seemed to fly by because before I knew it we were strapped to our seats and we goooooo
You @MONTH1 heard it before: Patience is a virtue. If you don't already know, patience means understanding and tolerance. The opposite of this could be grumpy, or have a @CAPS1 for a short time before you get mad. I believe patience is important in life @CAPS1 and I try to be patient every day. I believe life is a marathon, not a sprint, I mean, if something takes time, I connect life to sports because I'm a @CAPS1 elite athlete. I play football, which also requires a lot of patience. When my pass was good but my receiver lost the ball, I remember being patient with him, as my coach did with me. Football is a team sport and we all have to be patient with each other. While exercise is a great example, patience is much more than that, you have to be patient with yourself before you can be patient with others. what do i mean? Whether you are a child or an adult, you have to forgive yourself when you do something wrong. If you're late for work, you have to swipe it and say to yourself, "@CAPS2, don't do this again." @CAPS3, you forgot everything but what you just said. I'm back to sports again. If you lose a game, you watch a movie and realize what you did wrong and stop making those mistakes. Then you forget about losing and set your sights on winning the next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtues a person can possess.
Are you patient or told to your patients? Patience Patience is a @NUM1 year old girl who is always told how patient she is @CAPS1 is one of many stories about Patience being very patient. One day patiently wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in juancey, so her mother started looking it up online. It took her mom two weeks to get everything ready, she picked the amusement park, the money was going, they were going to stay at the hotel @TIME1. The patience throughout the process said nothing but waited without asking if her mom had everything planned or if she was still taking her to the amusement park. When they got to the hotel, the patient mom had to get the room key to go to their room, unpack, get dressed and go. The whole person's patience did not say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park, there was a long line to buy tickets, so they had to wait for two hours. Patience and no complaints. They finally got their tickets and chose the biggest roller coaster to go first. But there was a long line and patiently told her mom she really wanted to go on this ride and wanted to wait in line. Her mother said "okay" and they waited an hour to start, but all the waiting was worth it. Was very patient during all the waiting and finally got on all the roller coasters and had a great time. This is the story of patience. I hope you like it.
When I am patient is when I play volleyball. I'm very patient when I play volleyball because when you don't score, you can't serve. One game we didn't do very well, I really wanted to serve because I did a good overhand. Everyone has to serve that teammate except me. In the end our team ended up winning and I never complained about not being able to serve. Everyone cheered and chanted as they won by two points.
That must be painful! You have to wait every time you buy. If you've ever played a contact sport, you know you have an injury and have to wait for it to get better before you can play again. When your ankle hurts, it hurts. After hanging up, I had to go to the witch doctor because you have to wait forever, but sometimes it's worth it. Once you get in the nurse asks you a few questions, then you have to wait for more now @CAPS1! But at least you'll eventually find out what's wrong, and when the doctors come in they have to take X-rays, it took a while for witches to develop. But I finally got them back and found it was just a spring. After everything was fine, my football coach said I would only be on the bench in games because he didn't want to hurt my ankle again. But at the end of @DATE1, he let me play! I guess that's what I've been waiting for for all the games at patiatley.
One stormy day, my brother and I were playing football at our house. My brother kicked the ball into the air and made a scissor foot. The ball hit my mom's light and broke the bulb. She asked me and I said it was my brother. My mom said I should fix the lights. It was hard and the pieces kept falling off. It just takes patience to fix it. Finnaly, didn't manage to fix it. Patience is always patient.
Once upon a time there was a princess named @PERSON1 who was a good princess but one day she was hungry and didn't want to eat so she told her but she was taking a shower so @PERSON1 had to wait and be patient with her in her room sat there for years she read @CAPS1.V she went to see if she was done she didn't and @PERSON1 was impatient and very pissed and knocked on the door and said you better hang up or then she popped out of the corner of her eye Seeing someone, she realized she had turned on the light in the bathroom, no one was in there, what she did was now behind her, embarrassed and humiliated behind her, she ran to her room and cried, that's what The story of when the princess was impatient!
When I had the patience it was my sister who soaked in the tub for four hours. But I'm waiting for her to finish.
Finally, the day has come! The new roller coaster @CAPS4 michogg adventure we begin! ?? Can't wait! There was only one thing holding me back from continuing to ride, the drive. We stuffed our trail into an old minivan and set up @CAPS4. @NUM1 minutes later. "Are we there yet?" my brother said. Finally we have arrived. We waited halfway through the stall @CAPS4 ticked and we went in. My siblings want to continue? ? One hour left. "@CAPS1 up, your brother wants to ride a big horse," my mom said. Right there, the best is not puer! Just one question, there? ? people? ? get ready? ? ? "@CAPS2, it will be worth it" thought we queued, @NUM2 hours later, when the queue was over, @NUM3 eycloimed. "That's protected??? Keep it up!" @CAPS3 And then I read the thread @CAPS4. There were twice as many people in line. “@CAPS4 at least not so many people on other rides, I say @NUM3 very patiently keep riding even though it lost @NUM5 hours
Good morning @CAPS1 to renew his license. But I though if he woke up really early he would be the only one there. But of course, he won't be the only one out there. Unfortunately, everyone thinks the same. But @CAPS1 is really tired, he wakes up at @NUM1 but they open at @NUM2 but @CAPS1 doesn't know. So @CAPS1 went to the pancake house and bought him a hot cup of coffee, but when he came back there was a long line in the corner. But @CAPS1 waited and waited, @CAPS1 got permission.
Once I was very patient when my mother took me to a friend's house to play football. It's a long story, but I'll tell you anyway. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 called me over to play football. So I asked my mom for a ride and she said yes. So when we drove my ???? she had to go to the grocery store. She spent an hour there. She has to go to some or she spends @NUM1 hours there. Then I called and said "are you coming or something". Then I said yes. I've kept my cool and waited. Then I finally got there. It's no story. That's when I'm patient.
Here I am on day three of the @CAPS1 Volleyball Trials. I'm sure I'll be in the A team. I threw the ball up and let @CAPS3 fall back. Tossing is not good. I'm throwing @CAPS3 again and hitting @CAPS3 as best I can. "@CAPS1 last serve" I thought, "please finish." I watched the round white ball soaring in the thin air. When @CAPS3 got close to the net, it seemed to me that gravity suddenly came into play. The ball falls and rolls off @CAPS3 as it hits the net. @CAPS3 didn't let @CAPS3 end. I feel the cool breeze blowing over @CAPS1's sweaty face. I was sitting on the damp grass while the coach decided which team we were going to play. Finally, they hand me a small white envelope and I breathe slowly. I can feel @CAPS1's stomach tied in a giant knot. I've been waiting for this moment for months. I arrive with @CAPS1 sweaty hands in the envelope. The next second I was even more nervous. I slowly took the paper out of the envelope. I heard a girl scream with excitement. Lastly, I have to know the weather I'm on the A's, @CAPS2 or being cut. @CAPS3 It feels like the whole world depends on @CAPS3. When I saw the word "congratulations", I felt a burst of relief and excitement. @CAPS3 saw the rest of the letter, "You've formed the @CAPS2 team." I suddenly had mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1's body. I decided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone on the team and hugging those who didn't. After so long, I finally know. @CAPS3 makes me happy to know I tried something and had to wait to know if I succeeded. I wouldn't have @CAPS3 any other way.
@CAPS7 is my dad he hasn't been honed yet, right? ? ? . "@PERSON1, sweetie," @CAPS2 @CAPS7 began, "your father was drafted to fight." "@CAPS1" I ran to @CAPS2 walking around the room saying he could have said goodbye, I haven't seen him in two weeks , now he's gone. "@CAPS2 @CAPS7 walk in" @PERSON1 I know it's hard for you, but you can send him a letter. "I knew I was going to start one now, just like we did." @CAPS3 "She said when she walked out I wrote a letter saying Dad you could have said goodbye but you left. Well, I'll be waiting for @CAPS4 past no sign of hearing from him. The day I come home from school, I'm sad @CAPS7 any @CAPS7 dad?" @CAPS5 dear nothing. "I'm starting to grow up and still don't have letters. The @CAPS2 siblings got them but I don't have @CAPS6 Feeling forgotten." @CAPS7 Why I didn't get my dad's letter but everyone else said "I don't knowledge". @CAPS3. "I send him a letter every day. I don't get a reply. I'm starting to wonder why. Does he hate me? Does he not want to talk to me? Did he forget one? Me" @CAPS9 @CAPS7 Yelling "@CAPS1" "you have mail" I ran down the stairs to the kitchen and they were things on the counter for me @CAPS6 Hard @CAPS2 Names in @CAPS6 and @CAPS6 didn't say who @CAPS6 came from. "@CAPS7 who is @CAPS6 from" Open @CAPS6 and find out "@CAPS3" I slowly picked up the letters and started reading them. Don't @CAPS5 I haven't written yet, but maybe this will get @CAPS6 up "@CAPS12 You are more important than anything in the world @CAPS12 Dad I open the package, @CAPS6 is @CAPS2 Dad's pitch is us and he brought All letters and all letters sent to him were fired. After reading, they had a cashier form, in all envelopes, and he called that night and said "But, I @CAPS12, regardless of @CAPS1, I will Lots of reservations - Ding said so quickly. "
Patient is a place where you can wait or stay for someone or something. Some people can be very, very patient. But others simply have no patience. It's like when you're in line at the store someone has a lot of stuff and you're in a bit of a hurry. Now you can be rude and yell, his or her screaming and all the crazy mess, or you can just be patient and maybe she'll let you cut. That's what a patient means to me.
Patience is one of the most important life skills in the world. It was so nice to have my best friend live across the street. He has @NUM1 sisters named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 has Down syndrome. This basically means she doesn't understand things as fast as you and me. You can also see this in the way she behaves. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I've ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as I do has a downside. You need to be very patient. When talking to her, many people give up because she doesn't understand, but her closest friends have developed unparalleled patience. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that can happen. She made me a master of one of the most important life skills. @LOCATION1 is a great person and I think a great teacher, but be grateful when you have a bad day because not everyone is as lucky as you are.
My family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 at @CAPS1 on a hot @DATE1 day. We went to all the rides. Our last one is @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The line was short when we went there. Once we got there, the line went all the way to the train. It's like waiting for a pig to fly. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My dad and mom stayed to save our place. When we came back, my parents were the other ones who came back. "@CAPS4 Are we this far?" my brother said. My parents were unruly so they could have a drink. Ten wanted families lined up. We wait until something spontaneous happens to us. Ten families is the wrong line, so we have to be in front (after the other three). My family and I had a great time and it was worth the wait.
Everyone has to be patient. Everone has patience, depending on whether it's long or short. People always say "Patience is OK". @CAPS1 If they are @NUM1 grade teachers, they especially need to have a lot of patience with what they do. Teachers expect older kids/young people to behave well when you get into @NUM2. Now, if you have a job that focuses on adults, your patience probably won't be very high/long. Like my dad, he's a lawyer, he deals with adults, and his patience doesn't match my mom's. My mom still deals with adults, but she grew up with four brothers, but she is the eldest. My dad expects people to arrive on time within minutes. When I said to pick me up at seven, he would arrive before seven. Now my mom comes to pick me up and I say seven o'clock, she's about ten minutes anyway. This is my story about people I know and "patience".
Patience @CAPS1 and my mom in the wagon as we go to the store for groceries and then to school for clothes. My sister wasn't really not going, but my mom let her go, so she was already pissed about it, but we went for food that she obviously "didn't like", but she was just her normal person! Self-esteem and greed. "We're here" Mom said as we went shopping for my sister at @CAPS2. She didn't like @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 or like me because she didn't think she could fit them but we did anyway and she didn't see anything "she liked" so she started throwing storms ? My mother was very patient with her. I can't believe so we lost her name and she brought @CAPS1 to my spare.
That's @DATE1, @PERSON4 messing around on his desk in class as usual. @PERSON4 is usually not the type to be patient. Then his teacher asked the class a question that @PERSON4 thought in his mind was one of the best answers. @PERSON4's hands are directly in the air. One of the first to raise their hands. "@CAPS1! Lots of answers." <@NUM1</PERSON> Berry said. @PERSON1 berry is more of a round person with some big glasses. But all the students love her as a @CAPS2 teacher, "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 what's your answer?" @CAPS5 I'm just scratching my head. ok @CAPS6. " "@CAPS7 language? " @CAPS8 great answer". There are still about @NUM2 hands in the air. In the mind of @PERSON4 he just wanted to blurt out his answer, but he knew he would at least try to be patient this time around. "@CAPS9 these last @NUM3 people, then we'll go to @CAPS5." <@NUM1</PERSON> exclaimed Berry. @PERSON4 rages impatiently in his mind, but outside he looks as calm as possible. "@CAPS10". @PERSON3 said. "@CAPS11 a metaphor?" @CAPS10 replied. "@CAPS13 You're right, it's a metaphor." "@CAPS14 That's my answer!" @PERSON4 murmured. But even if another classmate accepted his answer, @PERSON4 was happy knowing he was patient.
Bang! I just shot myself in the foot with the @CAPS1 gun. It all happened when my sister bought a gun for his birthday. I walk up to a target to yell, that's when I get shot, I yell, that's when I get shot. I went to mine for more and told her what happened. The next day we went to the doctor's office to see my feet. The doctor has about @NUM1 or @NUM2 patients, including me. My mom said "@CAPS2 it might take a while. I'm a barely impatient person. We waited, waited, waited for an hour. Today wasn't my day. She called someone by name and it was me The heat waited for @NUM3 hours and the doctor finally called my name. After @CAPS1 was taken off, I went home to sleep. That's when I had to be patient.
patience! Patience can get you what you want, and I'll tell you a story about how I got what I wanted through patience. It @DATE1; I asked for a men's scooter two weeks before my birthday. I was told that I was too young. Of course I'm pissed, I'm pissed. I waited a few days and I didn't get it. I waited another week and still didn't receive it. When my birthday came, (@DATE2) I finally got my Matai scooter! I am very happy! That's why people should be patient because you might get what you want!
The one time I had the patience was when my grandparents and I were driving to Florida. It took about a day and a half to arrive. Then it took us six hours to get to @LOCATION2. My uncle @PERSON1, his wife and his four boys also went. They rented a house for us to live with. On @DATE1, after we got them, we went to @LOCATION1 to see my grandpa's sister @PERSON2. Since we got lost, it took us about an hour and thirty minutes. The last time we went to Florida was to see my cousin @CAPS1 get @CAPS2. Nope, his little sister got @CAPS2 and I can't wait to meet them. The wedding is @CAPS3 I can't understand. So I wait for it to end. After the wedding, we went back to my aunt's house. On @DATE2 we went to the flea market and it was huge. It took us an hour to watch the whole thing. I wanted to leave at booth 55, but I had to do something for my mom and dad. So again I wait patiently for us to leave. On @DATE3, we leave home. We got here near @NUM1 at @TIME1. I was so tired that I almost fell asleep on the floor. So the whole ride to them and back I waited patiently.
Patience is a very important skill. You need this to live your life. Your life would be crazy if you didn't have patients. Once, when I was patient and had to wait, it felt good. A day about @NUM1 years ago. I went to @ORGANIZATION1. If you've been there, then you know how long the line is. They can be up to an hour and a half or so. I'm waiting for my turn to go to the haunted house. Looks like it's going to be fun. Then when I got there, there seemed to be @NUM2 people in line. My mom asked, "@CAPS1, do you want to change the ride and come back and be the Hannah I love?" I told her no, we queued. After about @NUM3 hours in line, there were only about @NUM4 people in front of my mom and I. Then finally it was our turn to get into the chairs and buckle up, and it's nice to know that after a long wait, I did it, I'm patient. I peeked to see if it was our turn and I just stood there patiently. That's when I realized I've been very patient. From then on, I knew I could really do it, patient. This is an important skill to help you live your life without going crazy
I was a patient once and I broke my arm. I'm at @NUM1 there. I was playing outside and was climbing a pole and I fell and put a @CAPS1 on it and it swears. My doctor is calm. And it's good. Anyway, this is when I was a patient
The time I started being patient was when I was queuing up to se @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the line was too long and I was about to leave but I didn't want to lose my spot so when I got into the rhythm the line was longer than the outside so I Very patient, so when I got to the end of the movie, I was so pissed that I went home and went to bed.
Patience, @CAPS6 An important part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 is something everyone needs. But not everyone has it. I believe everyone needs patience because everything takes time. If you "have no time" to do something, then you have no time to live. If no one had time to live, I wouldn't be here right now. I believe patience @CAPS5 is more than its definition. I believe this means being able to pass in low time so you can do something. If all you do is work, then live a pretty boring life. For example, if you have an @CAPS1 teacher taking an elective for @CAPS6. She has to be patient to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she might not be a teacher. Another example is, let's say you're on @NUM1 and you're going to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 let you down as @NUM2 cars pile up. You honk your horn. That doesn't speed things up any faster than it does now. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 is perfect when you honk, but it doesn't make anything faster. "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9" when people hear someone honk. @CAPS10 @CAPS5 is very correct. When you honk in traffic it doesn't make anything faster, it makes things look longer and people immediately tag you @CAPS11. In conclusion, I would say patience @CAPS5 is important to humanity because if no one had patience, no one would be on earth right now
When I was patient last year, I had to be patient every day because of my aunt. Last year my aunt would pick me up at the back of school one day, I don't know if she was picking me up, like this time, it was the first day of school, I don't know what happened. I don't know who will pick me up. I don't have a phone, so I can't call Mane. There, I waited patiently at school. When my friend and I went to his house to wait, I went back to school and waited. About @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes or about an hour, my auntie came to pick me up.
My neighbor was so patient when he killed @NUM1 for the first time! he is? ? ? And proud of him for catching this beautiful white-tailed deer! He said he had never been so proud before. He went out to dinner and when he told me I thought of the neighbor's face and I was so happy for him. If I had the money, I'd get something for @NUM1 points. My jaw dropped when I saw its head, the most beautiful deer I've ever seen.
@PERSON2 got out of his warm house and into the cold air. He staggered slowly over the ice to the barn. Barns are different. It was a pitching barn. @PERSON3 has trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I'm already in the barn and I've turned on the heater. I'm warming up, doing wrist flicks, "ks," one-leg throws, arm loops, and screwball flicks. My catcher @PERSON1 catches the ball every time. @PERSON3 said, @CAPS1. "Show me your screwball and rising ball." I stood on the mound and threw my screwball. It bent to the right and the glove cracked. "@CAPS2! Awesome! Hey you! Give me a high five!" @PERSON1 said. I clapped her hand and we both said "@CAPS3!" "@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now give me a boost," @PERSON2 said. I threw one. @PERSON3 gave me pointers after I threw three up pitches. "You're doing great. Just open your legs and flick your arms up a little more," he said. He never lost patience with me. Never after a rising ball nearly hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many sales pitches, I finally got it. Ten minutes later, we were done with our pitch meeting. @PERSON3 tell me I'm doing fine. He said we'll be working again on @DATE2. "@CAPS5 is @DATE1. Right?" I asked "@CAPS6 day!" he said happily. He gave me a hug. I love @PERSON3. Not just because he is my father. He is also a great man. Happy, funny, sweet and patient @PERSON3. "
One time my dad was supposed to go to a race. But I had to wait until my dad said he was going to start work at @NUM1 o'clock, which is when the game started. It took an hour to get there so I knew we would be late and couldn't meet my driver and sit in their car. So I patiently play with all my toys in my room. I'm afraid I won't go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Then I felt something beating on me, and I opened my eyes and saw my dad say get up and go to the race. I am very happy. We got there and we found out we were an hour early the wrong time. So I had to meet the driver and sit in the car. That weekend, they ran three hundred laps. That was the end of the racing season of the year. First they ran three hundred laps. @CAPS1 They were in row eight. Afterwards they had a school bus derby. I'm glad you came to the school bus race. One kid said, "Now how do I get to the school there, all the school buses crash." @CAPS1 The race is over and I thank my dad for taking me to the race and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2.
I have to be patient when I go to @LOCATION1 with my family. Our flight leaves at @TIME1 am, so we got there at @NUM1. We waited two hours. No one complains because each of us has something to do. I was playing video games with @PERSON1 while my mom was reading and when we finally got on the plane it took three hours to get to @LOCATION1 and no one complained. So that's the story of five hours when no one complained!
Me, my mom and @CAPS1 all went to Best Western on a super hot summer day. The reason is that we don't have air conditioning and we melt like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to the room to change into our bathing suits, went down to the pool and found a place to put our towels there. However, everyone has to go out for chemical cleaning. I was on fire with anger and disappointment, but I calmed down and waited. I waited, waited, and waited, but no one was able to get in. It's only been fifteen minutes or so, and everyone is gloomy. Finally, there was a buzzing sound in my ears! But that meant the snack bar had some food ready, so that gave me hope, but again they were disappointed. Waiting, still waiting, and then a voice said, "Okay, everyone back in the pool." I was so happy about that, I ran and jumped right in! It took about half an hour, not worth it, but still a lot of fun. So maybe the next time something happens that takes a long time, I'll try to be less angry and happier, maybe .
The one time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play a game I waited for a while so the last time I sat and watched my friends I never had the patience when it came to food I didn't like to wait for mine when I had to wait, the food was very Oops. I don't know other times when I'm patient, I don't like being patient.
I had a cold on @DATE1 @TIME1. It was still almost pitch black. I was hunting with my father among the blind, so quiet I could hear a needle falling. I have to be very patient because even the slightest movement can scare the deer away. We sat there for almost NUM1 hours without even making a sound. Patience was hard for me, but I did it. I waited patiently in the woods, and soon a deer came. I had to wait patiently until his head fell so I could get up and shoot. This took about @NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it because I finally shot the deer and my family and I ate some for dinner.
Today I had a meap of @CAPS1 Patient @CAPS2. meap is @NUM1 to @NUM2 days @CAPS3. It has writing, reading, math. This is the hardest thing you have to do in school. I think it's the hardest thing in life, but it helps you learn more and may help you in your future work.
When you have patience. I was in @NUM1 grade when I had the patience. When I was in @NUM1 grade, my teacher said we had to write a story about our patience. So, at one point, they were a girl named @PERSON1 and she was impatient, so the hollow world turned her into impatient. @PERSON1 hated the name so she let herself say to her @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I let them @CAPS3 call me that. So @PERSON1 goes around her street and asks everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 is called impatient. No one will tell her the answer, so @PERSON1 shouts out @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 are called impatient. Then @PERSON1 heard the voice was an old man his name was @CAPS4 and he said I don't @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was called that @PERSON1 said @CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. And then @PERSON1 though for herself, I have to be patient. So what @PERSON1 did was she went to the store, you don't know what she did, she got in line, she was patient, so when everyone went, they all said well done @PERSON1, everyone Stop making her impatient.
Are you patient? Once, me, mom, dad and sister went to @CAPS1. When we got there, they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was patient and sat there quietly and waited. Then after @NUM1 we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menu and found what we were looking for. The waiter came back and asked what we wanted to eat. I said steak and my dad, mom and sister also had mini tokos. She said ok, our food will be out soon. Well, it turns out she digressed. We sit there @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave, but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finally after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out, happy. The only bad thing was that the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily it wasn't frozen. We paid the bill and left without leaving a tip. After that, my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again.
Sometimes I do show patience and sometimes I do. Patience is a good character trait in leaders of @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Without patience, you will use @CAPS5 on everything you do. So be a leader, someone @CAPS4't @CAPS5 up. Be someone you love and do everything you can. Remember, patience is everything.
Have you ever waited for something that looked so @CAPS1 that seemed like it needed to be so @CAPS2 to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have, just @DATE1 I took @CAPS3.AT into @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, also known as @CAPS8, (@NUM1-@CAPS9) I have to wake up at @NUM2 am, at @DATE2, ready good. I have to beat @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM3. When I got there, I had to wait in line for @NUM4 minutes to find out which room I would be taking the test in. @CAPS10 @CAPS11 took the exam! Three breaks! However, when I was done and walked out of my room, surrounded by about @NUM5 other kids taking the test, I met my mum who gave me an encouraging smile and a big hug. Since my three best friends also attended, we all roamed the campus alone afterwards. It turned out to be a beautiful day!
@CAPS6 night is @NUM1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I'm curious to know what I got for @CAPS1 the next day. I can't sleep at all because I'm so excited to get my gift and celebrate @CAPS1. I love @CAPS1 because all the joy, fun and happiness in everyone's spirit @CAPS6 is well worth the wait because if you wait then good things will come to you and those around you. Sometimes I already know some of the things I get for @CAPS1 (because my mom is a bad hider) I'm patient with other people because I want them to be patient with me too. Treat others the way you want to be treated. I think @CAPS1 is the happiest time of the year, isn't it? @CAPS6 It's fun to fellowship with pets, friends and family as you get closer, that's my patient response. Thanks for your time @CAPS9
I chose to write a story about a patient in my own way. A patient is a time when you can wait for something or someone. Just like in a restaurant, you have to be patient with your food. In the aircraft holding area, you have to wait patiently for the plane to land and prepare to take off. These are the things I know about patience.
I'm trying to be patient now. You see @CAPS1 my birthday is coming up and my phone is not working? ? ? I told my mom I needed a new phone. She's illegible, so I'll have to be patient, our thing? ? ? super cool! @CAPS1 is nv @CAPS2. Not sure which one it is? ? ? Patience is really important. Being patient means not complaining? ? No, mw yells. Can patients come sometimes? ? ? That? ? ? .so I'll be patient and see how it goes .
I have to be patient all the time when I teach my puppy (@PERSON1) right and wrong, when are you patient? @PERSON1 is a new addition to my family and he is still learning from right and wrong. I try to teach him something every day and when I review it like @NUM1 times I go crazy. Mom told me @PERSON1 is just learning, be patient with him, it helps train him faster! I have to be patient when teaching @PERSON1 new things, he will learn faster if I have patience
@DATE1 @TIME1 It's cold and the football teams of @NUM1 and @NUM2 levels play at different times. The game starts around @NUM3 and we start cheering. After about @NUM3:15 we got very cold, we were warming up, but we were still cold. So now we're cold and we're getting a little grumpy. The second half was even colder. We all braked and went to grab some hot chocolate. Well, we hurried back to the stands to sit down and I started walking faster and faster and then I dropped hot bile in front of me. Well, I'm pissed, but I'm the leader of @CAPS1, so I have to be happy. Then we started cheering again, it was colder than when we started, but we kept cheering, but then some @CAPS1 leaders decided they wanted to warm up there, and if more people wanted to take them away, all had to join them off, so we did. We froze, but we held on until @NUM7 game over. Then we all went home and presumably went to bed.
I think patience comes into play in a lot of places. For example, you have to be patient to get a job or your boss will kick you out of the building without a word. Another place where you have to be patient to succeed. If you moan and moan because something is taking too long, it's not patience. Your best bet is to stand up and try to do something. Finally, if you have to wait for it, don't get it right away, if you're making money from your job, you're not just going to rob where you have to be patient.
Once I was at the airport at @LOCATION1. We're going home from @LOCATION2. After getting off the plane, we had to go to customs. Only two people work for @LOCATION3 citizens. The line is long. After half an hour, we were only halfway there. There was a lot of waiting and a lot of complaints, but we finally got through. Of course, they all thanked us for our patience, and once the passports were stamped, we were on our way to our next flight.
Once upon a time, there was a young girl named @CAPS1 who lived with her parents in a small town in @PERSON2. Is the mom of @PERSON2 town. It was almost her birth, and she was so excited for this birthday because she was twelve years old. Twelve was her very small lucky number. Her mom said they could go into town to eat at Chef @PERSON1 and she agreed, so she woke up that morning and dad made her some pancakes topped with fresh strawberries and she went out to milk her parents. @CAPS1 hates milking there because they are so stubborn she goes there and only milks the cows with @NUM1 minetts. @CAPS1 Go back inside and put the milk on the table. @CAPS1 started to wonder if she was going to get a birthday present, @CAPS1 decided when her mom came home from get off work (she works in a clothing store) she better wait patiently and say "Are you ready? Go to dinner," @CAPS1 jumped up," and yelled, yes, yes. So they rode into town, stopped at the restaurant, they walked in, the lights were off, her dad took the light switch, and all her close family and friends were in There, they yelled "sprise" @CAPS1, which surprised her by shouting: "@CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, there are twelve presents on a table and a dog under the table. Her parents raised her a dog. She named the dog Miracle because every time she saw it, she started to doubt her wonderful life. She learned that when you have patience, great things come.
Patience is about waiting and not being frustrated. When my family and I go to @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION1 state games. My dad is very patient, which is unusual because he's usually very patient. So where are we surprised. There was a line of people not thinking when we entered the stadium, @CAPS1 was in our seats so we waited for security to tell them to move, it took them about half an hour to find my dad's patience again and again, but our @CAPS1 Can't wait, when the security got there, we started getting really pissed, we had to wait for them to make a mess of our rist barn, he was still patient, after that we got a seat, I'm slatted, But my dad's rezzon patience was because he didn't want to be kicked out of the stadium, so he was patient and kept his cool.
I have a lot of patience when I'm at Cedar Point. Last time before @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1 I went to Cedar with my friend @PERSON1. This is my first time and it's like @NUM2 times by @PERSON1. We did a lot of rides, but the bad ones were the lines. The lines are huge! I wasn't very patient at first, but after a while I was patient and my friend wasn't. My friend wanted to get on the trailer, but I didn't. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of great riding. The lines are getting longer. My parents didn't have the patience at that time, but my friends did. I'm funny because most of the time it's the opposite. Sometimes I wish people were more patient. But I don't know if this will happen.
Are you patient? Well, if you are like us. But I'm at that guy now? ? ? Patience his name is @CAPS1.M. @CAPS1.M Knowing the secret of patience helps him a lot is that he says a lot? ? ? ? ? ? ? Much like the one time we were in Chiddes. However, we queued for three hours! @CAPS2 dolo cares though he's just a giant? ? ? ? ? ? one? We played outside and we did a full live mesl ho got stabbed five times but didn't complain about how bad the damage was @CAPS4 I have some patience but not as much as @CAPS2. But @CAPS2 isn't perfect because he's in a hurry, he's impatient, and I've stated why in the documentation. One time @CAPS2 showed the patience it had to be ?? his mom's car was ?? and @CAPS4 was outdated so the car was cold @CAPS4 took nine hours to get hit four times and it made his mom fall already? ? But until he wasn't? ? ? When he finally got but? ? ? They have a great idea for @PERSON1, they go to @ORGANIZATION1 for us to buy food. @CAPS2 seems to be the most patient person I've ever met.
I went to the store with my mom one day and we had the old lady @CAPS1 in front of us, she couldn't do anything, she was walking slowly and I knew she was the @CAPS1 old lady. But she's really slow and I don't really have a patient @CAPS2 that some people have.
Only once a year I have patience for something, and that is @CAPS1. I can never wait for @CAPS1 to arrive. I had to meet my brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, everyone. It's the best time of the year and it's next door to my birthday.
There was a time when I had to go to the doctor every month for monthly checkups. When we got to the building, my aunt and I realized there were more cars than usual there. As we walked in, we noticed a flyer that said "@NUM1 shots @DATE1 threw @DATE2." @CAPS1 When we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and walked into the waiting room, we saw @NUM2 people . Luckily not everyone was waiting @PERSON1, but I did have to wait an hour and forty-five minutes. @CAPS1 When I finally went to the doctor, she gave me a shot to make sure I was fine. After a long day, I came home and took a big nap.
One time I had to be patient was when we went to @LOCATION1 to visit family and friends! We did a big trip there, very tireless, we patented, his trip took @NUM1 hours like a flight, and then I was in the air for another @NUM1 hours, and we went down the highway For part of the trip one sat in a small black sedan next to the pacific and we could reach for it because the fist was mine was a breathless hill and the other was an Acer on a bike I slept and listened to the radio almost one But @NUM3 hours then refinay stopped after san @CAPS1 where we had a plan to ride a home run @NUM4½ hours @CAPS2 to atlanta @LOCATION2 It was in a mid-section alog program and we were in the middle. We were college students on both sides and they would go across the hall and yell at the other side. I tried to sleep but we had the most uncomfortable plane trip of my life and it made me uncomfortable but I had to be patient and it was all over.
Patience is controlling yourself to write you wait. To be patient, you have to wait until whatever you are waiting for is done. @CAPS1 means keep calm to yourself. For example, if you go to the doctor's office for your annual checkup, you must sit in the waiting room for at least an hour before they call your name. But be patient sometimes. Like when you're at a pizzeria waiting for your pizza to be delivered, @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, @CAPS1 is, someone mode stuff. Not that people are patient
One day, me, my mom, my dad, my sister, my troubles went to fire moutan. So we had to wait a long time and then we finally got to the front of the line and we got our seats and we were seated and then we had to wait a long time for a waiter. So we kept singing until our waiter. Then she came, I said faster. Then she came. Then we got our drinks and our food, then we ate our food, we drank our drinks, and we went home and that was my calm time.
Once, when I was patient, I was rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher did a leaf project in my class. We must collect @NUM1 leaves to get @PERCENT1. When I started collecting the leaves, I had to press them dry. To do this with the leaves, you have to place the leaves on the newspaper, and then place the book on the newspaper, so that the water will flow from the leaves to the newspaper. This process takes a long time, sometimes you need to do it several times for each leaf. I had to wait patiently because the first deadline was approaching, but Mom said to form my project by the next deadline. So, thanks to my patience, my project was completed by the second deadline with @NUM2 points. So when your patients are rewarded
My mom and I are on our way home from Songko. We were stopped by a trame, it was slow, my mom and I were waiting patiently, but my mom wanted to go to ternanon in a few minutes, but we stopped and it was done.
Once I got birthday money and I wanted to buy an electric scooter for the weekend @CAPS1 I always wait for my dad to come home @CAPS1 We can watch online he always comes home and we watch but I never like any One day he didn't have to work @CAPS1, we looked at some and I found two I liked. One is a petrol scooter and one is an electric scooter. We went to see the gas scooter and it cost a lot and had a bunch of snacks on it @CAPS1 We called the electric scooter guy because I don't like gas scooters, we went? ? ? ? ? ? I got it, I tied it to @MONEY1, it's oriyiek @NUM1 @MONEY1 @CAPS1 I got home and rode for three days, am I? ? ? We went to the garage one night and it got out of hand? ? ? We thought it was a fuse? ? ? It's the controller and everything is connected to its parts @CAPS1 We called the company and ordered the parts, they sent us the wrong thing, we told them it wasn't right, they sent the same @CAPS1 again it from It fell off the table and we forgot @CAPS1 I ordered it again now and they said they were sending the correct controls this time. @CAPS1 I've waited about @NUM2 years to @NUM3 months.
Patience, as the name suggests, is understanding and tolerance. I'm impatient, I understand, but I'm not that tolerant. However, some people are forgiving, understanding or patient. This is the story of a man I know who is very forgiving. In grade @NUM1, my math teacher's aides had to be very patient with us because they would ask the same questions over and over. She would teach the lesson, not re-teach it before confronting the real problem. I was in the senior group so we walked fast and never had to ask questions. I will never be as patient as she taught those people.
At one point I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother @CAPS1 went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened, a car suddenly pulled into his driveway, and @CAPS2. As our truck didn't have airbags, it was bad. The other driver was in a van with an airbag. About @NUM1 minutes later, my mom got a call about what was going on. Then we rushed to the crash site as fast as we could. I had to wait in the car until my dad came back to get @CAPS1. I wait patiently, and I pray he's all right. Thank goodness my prayers were answered. He just had some bumps and bruises. But the car was towed away. We went to the truck later to get our belongings. Look what happened to the truck, the damage on the truck wasn't as bad as what happened to the other driver vans. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But I'm glad I still have my brother.
I'm going to tell you about the time I had to be patient with this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago...I walked into the classroom and got everything ready. I obviously wasn't, because four minutes later, this thing appeared before my eyes. So, I started thinking about the time I used my patience. Good this time. Now don't get me wrong, I see why we're using @CAPS1, to... uh, I think it's to help us learn, or to get our hands hurt and cramps, I don't know, really. Writing patience is very difficult because you lose it very quickly. But @CAPS1 is @CAPS1 and I think I'm the best so the story has to go on! It's quiet here, and the smell of pencil and paper is long. My eyes were so tired that I couldn't help yawning. My hands fell asleep and every second you hear "sniff", "sniff", "sniff"..."sniff", "snot". We didn't get up loud, so we were stuck "sniffing", "sniffing", "snotting" for an hour. When you were a kid, whoever graded it, did you take this test, or part of it? Well, it's none of my business, it's okay. Oh! My hands really hurt! For a second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that's better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You may not have the patience to read this, so let me start with this...write about patience, but for now, I'm done. (Yes!)
The one time I had a lot of paitenits was when I was skating. I was doing spins and stunts everywhere, but I didn't land. I fell on my back but the injured bone was my arm and my mom was surprised I was even able to get up because I fell so hard. My arm hurts badly because of it. So my mom rushed over to help me and we had to go home. The next morning, it does @NUM1 times more damage. I had to go to the doctor to get an X-ray of it and it took them two weeks to develop. So I went through two weeks of misery. So it turns out, I didn't break my arm, but I was in a lot of pain waiting for the results. I spent a lot of patients waiting, waiting, waiting for those X-rays,
It was a cold autumn afternoon. Means where my grandpa goes hunting. We gave birth in the morning @CAPS1 nolvek. I hardly know what will happen that day. We fell into the ground dead zone at about @NUM1. From what we've seen, it's going to be a long afternoon. We sat there for @NUM2 hours @CAPS1 It seems like an eternity. We waited and waited @CAPS1 still no deer. At the sight in front of us blind people, my heart suddenly raced. We seduced the biggest she I've ever seen. It was a monster-sized deer. @NUM3. @NUM4 feet tall and @NUM5. shelf. I loaded up my @NUM6 special and got a shot in the shoulder. I was so excited I almost screamed. As with any story, there is a lesson. Some people respect your elders. @CAPS1 My patience has paid off. As you can see, I am rewarded.
Once I was patient. I don't want a birthday party. So my parents started talking. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1 and we played pretty much all the games (didn't get to play the dummy ones), did the cart ride twice, then we went to buy a new video game and some new dirt bikes Gloves. I was very patient during that time so I could do fun stuff.
"Patience is a virtue." I hear this phrase over and over in my head. "Forbearance is virtue, forbearance is virtue." I never really thought about it until I first went to babysit my cousins. My cousin @PERSON2, he's only around @NUM1, whatever you want. She is an easy person to take care of. But my other cousin @PERSON3 has to follow his own agenda. It's not that I don't love him, it's just that I think he has to be one of the hardest kids to take care of. We got off to a good start that morning. We ate snacks, played in the room for a while, made some crafts and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to go home, @PERSON1 pooped in her diaper. Now, I've dealt with a lot of poo diapers before, @CAPS4 I'm not too worried. I put @PERSON1 on the dressing table and took her diaper off before I realized I didn't have the wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were but he was playing with those bottle pumping stuff. "@PERSON4 I need you to get the wipes. Now." @PERSON1 is squirming right now and I have to catch her if I don't want poop all over the house. "I know, but I can't" "Then why can't you?" "@CAPS1 I don't want to." When I realized the phrase "patience is a virtue", I started to lose my temper. I took a deep breath and realized that I felt what the patient was feeling. "@PERSON4 I bet you can't get them as fast as a cheetah!" "@CAPS2 I can!" "@CAPS3, prove it." @CAPS4 He did. I realize that if your patience and cunning might come to you, you'll get the job done faster.
I want to know who will win. I just wish I would. I am very nervous. I'm also a little scared. I don't know what will happen. I'm very patient to hear who won the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest. I am waiting for the game to end. I played the game earlier. I'm currently number one. I am very nervous. I'm nervous because if I win, I'll get two tickets to @CAPS3 for @LOCATION1. I sat quietly in the chair. I try not to show that I'm nervous. All I can do is wait for it to end. Then my mom said we could ride our bikes at the fair etc. First, I keep spinning. I was wondering if anyone had beaten my score throughout the ride. Next, we look for another journey. I try not to think about the game. Later, we found a car and continued on our way. When we got my mom told me I won. Delighted, I walked back to the place to receive the award. It was scary while I was waiting, but it was worth it. I've been nervous. I also try not to think about it. I'm in a hurry and I want to do it again when I have time. I told you when I was patient. when will you?
that? ? ? One of @CAPS1's most is that people never think about patience. they are? ? ? the opposite. them? ? ? Seemingly? ? ? @CAPS1 to @CAPS4? ? ? Feeling. at that time? ? ? and? ? ?

While I am patient. It is this @DATE1 that we are going to this place @LOCATION1. It took us @NUM1 hours to get there, but we said we forgot we were at @LOCATION1. But we are not at @LOCATION1. It was @NUM2 minutes, we were so sleepy, we went to the Holiday Inn, fell asleep as soon as we got to our room, then we went swimming that morning, and we lifted our bags to @LOCATION1. My two cuzins are making me nervous, I'm about to kill two of them, they keep arguing and talking about each other. Then we finally got there around @NUM3 pm and we had to take the little train to get there. The park is huge. First time riding me and my sister and my lil cuzins was a commet. We got on @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 runney foleon and @CAPS2, that's when I waited patiently
I stopped by a friend's house one afternoon and she couldn't find what she needed. So we went to her sister, but she was answering the phone, so we sat down to answer the phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We sat there for about seven minutes and we were both hospitalized. We moved in and asked her mother. I guess she was busy because she told us to sit down, be quiet and be patient. We sat there for another seven minutes, but she was still working. So we got up and went back to her sister. She's hung up now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was, but in a mean tone. "@CAPS1 in the drawer! Get out of my room now," she shouted. After some searching, we finally found @CAPS1. She's not that patient, and I know I'm not that patient either. My friend was still patient, but her tone was not. That's when I know someone has patience.
One day, I woke up and saw it was snowing + cold outside. I went to the living room to tell mom that I wasn't feeling well, so mom checked my seduction and said I have one? ? ? .I also have a runny nose, so she said I might have a cold. She has to go to work @DATE1 and she said she will stay home with me after get off work. So every time I needed something, she made me hot chocolate and breakfast, and she brought it to me as soon as I woke up. Every time I needed something like a drink, food, or even another blanket, she would stand up and get it for me. She was patient because every time I asked for something, she got it without complaining, she just did what I asked for. She even went to town to get me medicine. That's why my mother is the best and patient.
I must have patients in @CAPS1 in @CAPS2 and we must have patients in @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is @CAPS4, it's slow here, we get @TIME1, we're @CAPS5 in @NUM1 and we're in @CAPS3. A few hours in @CAPS3's @CAPS7 pants, I'm @CAPS9 going to @CAPS10 to sleep in the car. But I use patient's to find @CAPS3 and get @CAPS11 scering of @CAPS12 I have patient so I can do some @CAPS13.
There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I got @NUM1 pug puppies from a nice lady who lives @NUM2 minutes away. I was very happy when my parents made the final decision to buy them. We visited again with @NUM3 puppies when they were young. After our last visit we had to wait a full three weeks as they had to be old enough to go home with the new family. These three weeks seem to be going by slowly, but all the waiting has paid off. Patience gave me the opportunity to get ready for the puppy. We bought them beds, toys, crates and other dog essentials. We want to be ready for our new family member. It's finally time to pick up the puppy. They are so cute! We take them home and let them explore around our house. They love it! Our pigs turned into great dogs. I'm glad I had to be patient while waiting for our pig. I think good things really come to those who wait!
I was patient when my dad was rowdy because we had to wait for the doctor to tell us we could see him, but after a while the doctor came and said he went into a seizure and then had a stroke. They @CAPS1-@CAPS2 him (my dad), we waited about @NUM1 minutes, we used about @NUM2 boxes of tissues. The doc said "we'll keep him under observation overnight" @CAPS3 went to the hospital the next day and they had to pull the plug when it was white. I was patient at that store as I waited in the hospital lab, waiting for the doctors to tell us what happened, when they were taking @CAPS1-@CAPS5, and finally when they said they needed to unplug. @CAPS3 That's my story about when to be patient.
I'm a patient in a doctor's office, so I believe. I'm a patient because I once gave my knc a sprint and refreshed my coluler @CAPS1 which made me a patient. I almost forgot about the lump on my neck, so I was wary of my doctor.
It's hard to be patient at times, @CAPS1 I need to be what I want or want to do. Cool day at @LOCATION1, @CAPS2.CI just relocated to @NUM1 and is coming face to face with President @PERSON1! I won a game that allowed me to do that. When we got to the White House, a man took us inside. He took us to a small room and left. It was about @NUM2 at the time. He said we couldn't come out because we might be a distraction. So we wait to play hangman and see other @CAPS3. Then around noon, I was hungry. Around @NUM1:30pm @PERSON1 came in! He said "Would you like something to eat?" I said "yes"... We went to this fancy restaurant that I can't pronounce. He said sorry @CAPS1 had to wait, but I don't care if it's worth it.
I show loyalty to a lot of people, but I don't, they show loyalty to me.
The time when I was calm was when I was doing gymnastics. Pacients are key when you're trying to learn a new skill. For example, when I learn a new skill on the horizontal bar, it's called the handstand, and it's difficult. Day in and day out, I can never do it. I take my personal best every day, but I have to be patient with what my coach says. When that day comes, you'll do it, but until then, you need to keep working hard and doing the best you can, he said. It can take days, months or even a year to acquire this skill, but I just have to wait until the day my body can do what he calls the skill. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no results for my new skills. After four months of hard work, I finally did it. I got up at the bar and did it. All my waiting will be over. My coach told me that day, "I told you you can do it, it just takes time and patience, but today is your day and you do it. This is when I have to use patience to acquire new skills. I understand It's hard enough to be patient, all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you.
Pre-order @CAPS1 'Characters live happily ever after.....now! ' @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 Close the book, unfortunately we have no more pages left. This is the third book in her series, and she definitely only needs the fourth book. The next day at school, she went straight to the library. She opened the door and was greeted by the smell of dusty old books she liked. @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite bookshelf with her favorite books. @LOCATION1 glanced at the bookshelf and quickly noticed that the book was missing. She @CAPS11 Librarian @PERSON2 about @CAPS12 and was surprised to find the book already on loan. She put her name on the waiting list and was pissed that her name was number 10. The next day is @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. As a result we were disappointed. Her name is @NUM1 and it's only been a day and @CAPS6 is in a bad mood at home. "@CAPS3 Wrong!" @CAPS11 Her mom. "@CAPS4, I really want this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 has already borrowed it. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 may have to wait until someone else finishes." "@CAPS4, I Think you have to learn some patience," Mom said. "Patience? @CAPS3 is that?" @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 "Patience is when you wait for something, you don't complain @CAPS12. In your case, you are very impatient." "@CAPS6 I'm waiting" @CAPS7 Say, "@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you complained a lot." The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as possible. She didn't go to the library to ask for books, and she didn't complain the whole time. later. @LOCATION1 is called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and secretary @PERSON1. "@CAPS9" said @PERSON2. "@CAPS3 is this?" @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 "@CAPS12 is the book you want. @CAPS12 is checked into your account and ready to read." "@CAPS13 you" said @LOCATION1. She can't believe @CAPS12! She finally got the book! Moral: Patience pays off, especially if you're willing to wait.
I'm patient when my family and I are getting @ORGANIZATION1's signature. We queued for hours. My legs are cramping and sore, but I don't care to be excited about anything. I just wanted his autograph and finally I got it!
Just the day before football practice, my locker lock got stuck. All @NUM1 coaches trying to get rid of it. All but one, coach @PERSON1. He was in the locker room with me trying to get rid of it. We had to find @CAPS1 when we realized it didn't come off. When we found him, we asked for bolt cutters. We had to walk all the way through the school to pick them up. Once we had them, we had to walk back to the locker room. When we got there he tried to cut the lock. He tried @NUM2 minutes. They don't want to work. So we had to walk through school back to the tool room and buy another pair. This one finally broke the lock after @NUM3 minutes. I think that draws a lot of patients from coach @PERSON1.
For this article, I will tell the story of one of the most patient people in the world. In the old testament long ago, there was a man named @PERSON1@NUM1 who was very rich, very happy and loyal to God. The devil pointed this out one day and the devil said @PERSON1 could easily keep me??? away from God. God denies this, so the devil says let me? ? ? His crops and livestock, let me go for his camels "God said'' fine, but don't hurt @PERSON1 herself," the devil smiled slyly. When @PERSON1 had a bad day 2, his one? ? ? After saying "a fire there??? and saying," @CAPS1 your livestock was bitten by a wolf and there was only one left running my hand said the towel was stolen @CAPS1 you have a cold? ? ? servant? ? ? In and own roof there? ? ? In the lobby @CAPS1 your family was killed''! I have started though @PERSON1? ? ? Being a beginner living on an eth site will soon curse God, the devil is at it again, but this time making @PERSON1 terribly ill, though he still won't curse God for the next few years. When seeing this, he cast the devil out and catered to @PERSON1, he blessed me with a new family and faltune, then @PERSON1 was happy again
Long wait @CAPS1 "Only four" at the time. I have moved to @LOCATION4. Yes, from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4. It's a long way down south for me, but I'm a young little girl who doesn't really care, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarten, made friends, moved into a new house, etc. until I was seven. That's when I found out we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I'm not four years old anymore. I have a lot of great friends here (two of them in particular) and now I have to start over. I don't hate the idea, but I don't like it either. Of course. It doesn't matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the start that I was going to have fun and make new friends easily. The only things I don't want to leave behind are old friends, memories and all the other things I love about this place. So I took my memories, promised to keep in touch with my friends, and was moved. Novi is different but good. There are a lot of changes to get used to, but overall it's easy. I made a lot of new friends and now I hang out with them every day. I've slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and it feels normal. I have lived here for four years now. I've been exchanging letters, emails, events and memories with friends at @LOCATION4 and here. But even so, I was eager to go back. I've been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think the patience is paying off as I finally get to visit this year. My only difficulty is that I can't see everyone. But not for long. I've been meeting all my friends here and now I can meet my old friends too. give it to me! I can not wait anymore! Years of waiting gave me a chance!
I was at @LOCATION1 when I got bitten by a dog. The dog jumped up and bit my face. So my dad and his friends put me in the truck and we went to @ORGANIZATION1 with great hospitality at @LOCATION1. They put me in a hospital bed for @NUM1 hours. Then I was shipped to hurly. Then I sat in the hospital watching TV. Still waiting for surgery. I got it after @NUM2 hours. So I sat @NUM3 hours together. It can be infected all the time. I got a @NUM4 so they can stay there @CAPS1. But after all I'm a patient and I have to be patient.
I'm so patient with every thank you and @CAPS1. I have to wait patiently for each thank you. I'm so hungry I start whining, must I? ? ? ? ? ? thank us ???? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? and? ? ? ? ? ? as? ? ? ? ? ? Turkey. I'm so excited, I keep smelling. Then oh, I can tell you my favorite desserts now, but we? ? ? An hour later, so I'm hungry too, I'm very grateful? ? ? live with me? ? ? Homemade apple pie, oh they came in like corn and I jumped up and down. At @CAPS1, I'll have to be patient as I've been basking in the sun I now get what I search for? ? ? ? ?? It has my name on it. What if I found out? ? ? My parents or grandparents told me we had to??? First. Come here because I have to open my socks.
Today is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, so excited, he is restricted to the offline wall! "I wonder what @CAPS8 @PERSON3 will bring us," @CAPS3 @PERSON1, looking at a cat and dog, "I want this, this, and this, oh, definitely this." "@PERSON1, you Be patient. @CAPS1 is tomorrow and you need to do your part to help clear the tree," said @PERSON1's mother. “@CAPS4 I’m off to give gifts now!” @PERSON1 complained. "You know," his father said again, "@CAPS5 you're not a good @PERSON2, Santa will just bring you peanut shells." @CAPS6, @PERSON1 caved in and set, '@CAPS7 Well, I'll helpful. @CAPS8 Seems like many hours to @LOCATION1, time for bed. He's patient because he knows, at @TIME1, he'll have gifts.
patience. It's a warm @DATE1 @TIME1 I was playing wii with my niece at my sister's house when my brother-in-law Matt walked into the living room and said "@CAPS1 bored let's do something today!" @CAPS2 all of us Decided that we are going on an adventure in Michigan today. My sister @PERSON1 told us to pack snacks and drinks and put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But little did we know we actually had six hours to come to @CAPS3 to go to six signs while @PERSON1, matt and my mom had been planning for weeks. After two hours in the car, I moaned "Are we there yet?" "No." @PERSON1 said "lost" "Oh" I replied. But I really didn't think about how we got lost because we've been on Michigan adventures thousands of times before. For the rest of the journey, I was quiet. In other words, @CAPS4 is sound asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me excitedly. As my eyes adjust to the light, I stretch and squint from where the sun rises, and I look around and realize we're at Six Flags! When we first rode, we rode the superman that rides, you sit, stuff locked in your legs and stomach, I make you lean @CAPS2, like you fly, we want to ride It's @CAPS2 not good, but the line is @NUM1 ½ hour long. While we were in line we found things to do like swing and play on the metal railings and play my spy game and all sorts of things and when we finally got on and off I realized it was really It was fun and worth my patience and no complaints.
My mother is very patient. My mom is patient because she calls @NUM1 hours when she goes to the salon and the wait is not long. Another reason for her patience is that if I don't do my chores, she'll be very upset and she'll just ask me to do it again. My mom is also very patient when it comes to work because she doesn't get frustrated when she has a lot of work to do, like writing @NUM2 word essays

There have been many times in my life and I have been patient many times. For example, the other day I asked my mom if she would drive me to aim that I could get gum. My mom said you, but I had to pay a little. I waited patiently for my mother to pick me up. When I started targeting what my mom told me? ? ? up. I hit? ? ? in salary? ? ? So I had to wait. I was not angry, but patiently waited. Also, my mom didn't let mom get mom and she was very patient. An example of my impatience is, about. When I asked my dad to play a week ago? ? ? along with me. He said you, but you have to wait a while. For some reason, I became very angry and lost my patience. I started yelling why I was waiting. Then I hit my speed and I lost any patience. I said sorry and then we played catch.
Patience is one of the things people need to have. I remember when I was at the store, my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was saying wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you through your life. For example, if you are out with your friend and she is driving, you are tired and want to go home and say go. Then you're the impatient one because she's the one who drives. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you are patient, you can do better. You sometimes have to wait for a manager to call you to apply for your next job. But don't be impatient or you won't be hired. You always have to be patient because if you're not patient, you don't know what's going to happen.
@CAPS2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1! @CAPS11 The sound from the car. All I can think of is after @CAPS6 and lunch. As time passed and @CAPS11's heart beat, I became more impatient. For this reason, I don't like meap. While reading the selection, I thought "@CAPS7 has to be the most boring story in history" and then I turned the page, @CAPS8, @CAPS7 one was, "@CAPS9 makes me impatient. All I want to do is finish the test. @ CAPS9 is slow to read, but I don't want to be the last person to turn in @CAPS9. In writing, I think "@CAPS10 Am I going to write? " @CAPS11's hands start to ache, @CAPS11's head will run from everyone's pencils, like @CAPS9 in horror movies. @CAPS2-@CAPS1, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, and then You have to read over and over, make sure you have the headings and read the handwriting. The most stressful part of the job is the math section. There was one question I forgot. All the math teachers seem to be cramming everything from @CAPS9 into @CAPS11 at once Absolutely horrible. @CAPS9 Absolutely horrible. Then when you test someone can sit still and their desk starts to rattle. Well, if someone can't tell, one, I'm impatient, two, I don't Loves to eat shit. @CAPS2-@CAPS1 is the most annoying sound. Like many others, I'm trying to get good grades. @CAPS2- @CAPS1, a little bit, sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble.
One time I was patient was when me, my dad @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @LOCATION1. Me, @ORGANIZATION1 and my dad want to harness the power of millennials. So we waited in line for two hours under the scorching sun for a ride. Some of the difficulties were some problems with the ride. So when we finally got in the car, everything worked fine.
I am with my dad at @NUM1 am on @DATE1. I was sitting and watching hoping for something to happen when all of a sudden I got so hard I slept for an hour. When I woke up, I was watching but there was no news for an hour because I was waiting and waiting. Then from many nights I heard the leaves cracking and I thought it was true. On my first day, I'll take a picture of what I see. I'm a little too excited! I reached for the gun too fast and he ran. The other day we came out, I saw another dead, but this time on my left. But this time my gun was slower, @CAPS1 I aimed and fired! Well that's what I thought, but without it being stuck, @CAPS1 I had to uninstall it. Then my dad called me on the walkie-talkie and asked "what are you doing." @CAPS1 I said "I saw a doe", @CAPS1 he said "then shoot it" and it stood there @CAPS1 me Shot again and it ran away, "I missed" I said so much patience in vain.
I walked into the spacious open-plan room. The smell of crayons, animal crackers, and earth wafted through the air, pounding my nose like a giant wave rolling in the ocean. I took the nervous first step into the room. The floor is covered with toys and lots of crayons. Kindergarteners run around screaming like they hear critters about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is in the middle of it all. There was a distant look in her eyes, and it looked like she was about to cry. Her face lit up a little when she saw me and my name tag. She almost rushed towards me with her arms outstretched. The teacher introduced himself and said they were all mine. I would never have realized that student teaching would allow me to do so much teaching. I knew I would do a little, but when the teacher introduced herself and then said she was leaving, I had to teach them the alphabet. So I'm stuck with @NUM1 kids and a "war". Eventually I got a little involved and had the kids sit on the floor with applesauce criss-crossed. Too bad I underestimated how crazy they were. When I started, a kid started throwing toys at me, so I growled as calmly as I could, "@CAPS1 @PERSON1 this is not good, please stop." @CAPS2 stopped about @NUM2 seconds too short. So this repeated, and I ended up doing it with all the wild-eyed, crazy-haired dwarfs. It took me a lot of patience to get them to finally sit down. We talked about @CAPS3 when the species got picky again. I felt more like a nanny than a teacher then. I gradually understood how the teacher was willing to leave. Finally, the lightbulb in my head came on and I felt like I ran to my wallet and grabbed my candy bag and said, "When we're done with the letter A - @CAPS4, anyone who can say it all will get a candy bar!: "I realized to them it was like gold for adults. I was amazed and couldn't believe my ears. Every kid learns A-@CAPS4 and I'm practically out of candy, even though it takes a lot of patience and pointless squabbling. As soon as the bell rang, I left in a hurry to go home. It took a lot of patience, but I did it and rewarded myself. I slept!
The day I have patience is, one day my birthday is coming up and I'm really happy. I can't wait to see what I get @CAPS1. I thought about it for about a week and begged my mom to tell me @CAPS1 I got it. Days past, like they're getting longer and longer. I try and try to peak at @CAPS1 day in and day out, but I keep getting caught. So in the end my mom told me to stop thinking about it and be patient and it'll be named faster. So I waited, and it seemed like a long wait. The next day I woke up and my brother ran up and jumped on me and said, "Ah-ah, I know @CAPS1 you got it, but you don't." I jumped up and said @CAPS1! How do you know and I don't? "This sucks, please tell me" he said no, "and then I got up and walked out of the room, walked up to my mom and said 'I gave up' and she looked at and said be patient, it's going to go faster, you're only four A few days left." And then I left. Then the days started going faster and then my birthday came and I was so happy to finally see @CAPS1 I got it. That was the day I patiently waited for.
When you have patience. When I want something really bad. Like a cell phone or computer. But that's not the only way to @CAPS1 patients, you also have @CAPS1 patients in churches and doctor's offices, so there are many ways to @CAPS1 patients
I'm patient when I have to wait in long lines at the leader @CAPS1 amusement park! At @LOCATION1 I had to wait @NUM1 hours for my ride, @CAPS2. It went from @CAPS3 to @NUM2 in @CAPS4! When going to @NUM2, the coast went up, stopped at the top (@NUM4 yards) and we just sat for @NUM5 seconds! Then it moved and we dropped at @NUM6, which is pretty cool! It was worth the wait. That's when I'm patient!
It takes a lot of patients, especially when you travel in the @NUM1 hour strait. We went to @LOCATION3 for half a year when I was at @NUM2. Me my mom and my dad leave for the airport at @NUM3 am. We waited there for a long time. When we finally got on the plane, we took an hour flight to @LOCATION4. Ten @NUM4 hour flights to Los Angeles @LOCATION1. We waited a long time at those airports. Then the @NUM5 hour flight to @LOCATION2. That was the longest flight I've ever been on. The plane is a huge double-decker @NUM6 jet. Then we took the @NUM7 hour flight to Eagle Bay. It's been a really long trip. It took a lot of patients. Well, we went there because my dad was playing golf. It also takes a lot of patients, but it's more fun. That was the most patient I've ever had.
Last year t went to @LOCATION1 city with @CAPS1 mom, @CAPS1 stepdad, @NUM1 @CAPS1 brothers, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 her @NUM2 kids @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. The first place we went was his free state. We broadcast live for the ferry that takes you to the island where the Statue of Liberty is located. We waited in line to take the ferry to the island where the Statue of Liberty is located. This line is embracing funny. I thought, "@CAPS4 is great" because it happens to be @DATE1 outside and we're going to wait here for at least an hour. About half an hour later, I noticed a live stream coming into the building. what is inside? I would like to know. All the kids were complaining except us, @CAPS1's parents were starting to get pissed, we finally got into the building and guess what, another huge line! Yov is so funny! At least the building has air conditioning. We had to go through metal detectors and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry trip was ok but very full. On the plus side, we have to sit down. We all got off the ferry and looked up at the Statue of Liberty. It was actually really unfortunate that they closed the section you could go in because it was so hot. @CAPS4 Well, it's cool enough to see it. We walked all over the island trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited on live @CAPS5 until we got on board. I'm proud of myself for not complaining. Apparently @CAPS1 mom because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me aside and thanked us for being so patient
Patience is like waiting for your turn to speak or waiting for something to load, patience can help in many ways, such as waiting until you reach your destination or waiting for the person you're calling to answer the phone so you can talk. Patience allows you to go through hard times without complaining.
A patient story of a child waking up. He went upstairs to have a drink. He went back to watch cartoons. He became very excited. When he remembered that he was going to a football game today. @CAPS2 is playing @CAPS1. His father came downstairs and told him to get ready for the race. They drive about @NUM1 miles to @CAPS2 stadium. They get there to find their seats. Game start. @CAPS2 starts. @CAPS2 stopped them, and by the end of the first half, @CAPS2 was down. ? ? ? Scores are @DATE1 to @NUM2. You can already see people leaving. And then @DATE1. Now at the end of @NUM3. @CAPS2 is down? ? ? More and more people are leaving. @CAPS2 is back. We are still here. Now that @NUM4 is down, @CAPS2 gets another touch? ? They only dropped by three points. @NUM5 seconds? ? ? Throw ??? to @PERSON1 culler to pass to @LOCATION1 ??she. The crowd went crazy. We have enough patience to hold out until the end of the game.
This story is about my broken ankle. It happened about @NUM1 years ago. I was practicing swimming and was about to jump out of the @NUM2 lane. When I lost my balance on the obstacle, I realized I was about to fall and tried to grab myself, however, I ended up falling into the water, writhing and backing out of the swimming black. I have a really hard time getting out of the water. My mom called the doctor and found out I couldn't get one? ? ? almost? ? ? sky. So she came to the pool to pick me up and bring her old ??? I was in bed @NUM4 days had passed when I found out my ankle was broken. So I ended up spending @NUM5 weeks without practicing swimming, I was so bored. During that time I had to wait patiently for four days until I got the X-rays.
Okay, it's time for me to take the bus to Texas. My mom and my family are going to see my great-grandfather. The bus smelled good, but the same lady was wearing perfume all the time, so I just had to sleep and have a snack. I keep being woken up by a baby. Every time I go to the bathroom with my arms, there is always someone in the bathroom. Also, everyone seemed to get louder when I tried to fall asleep. So when catching @CAPS1' @CAPS2 my bus driver will wake us up and we will have to get off and go to another bus. It's as if you've never been on that bus. You have to have a lot of patients or you won't be able to relax at the end of the day. I finally got there in @NUM1 days. It was worth it as we went to six places. If I didn't have the patience, the experience of spending @NUM1 days on the bus would have been a horrible experience.
The one time I should be patient is when I'm with the same friend I want for a long time. As soon as I got here, I charged the computer to see if it was still available. "@CAPS1." I'm sad to try a lot and it's still there. It took me a long time to sort out my mood. When I quickly thought about the order, I was thinking "@CAPS2 as soon as I get @CAPS2." @CAPS3 I pressed the conformance order, but @CAPS3 and. They got it too, and now the hardest part is the water. I went to school the next day and the next day, and @CAPS2 went on for a week until I thought how much coal it would be to finally get @CAPS2. I took the long bus home. @CAPS3 wait for it to come. I rushed to the mailbox to get the mail and I found a box. My heart wants and jumps faster @CAPS3 I ran in to protect it, it's my @CAPS4 new I pad buck I'm so, so happy, all 'my patience paid off, I got it.
On this day not so long ago, I had to wait. No way, just wait. It was during the basketball tryouts that we found out if we were going to be on the team. I had to wait and wonder if I made it. I thought to myself...I wonder if I pushed enough, I wonder if I screwed up too much. " @CAPS1 All I can think about is the mistakes I made, so that day @TIME1 I've been sitting there waiting for my name...I have my name!" @PERSON1# @NUM1 tryouts, please come get your paper . " I got it, took it outside, opened it, read." @CAPS2 @CAPS3 You've got into the gold team. " I jumped up and down. I had my patient that day, and it was there. I built the team.
Two summers ago, I went to @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1. We had to drive @NUM1 hours straight. I mostly just sit in the back seat and listen to my @NUM2 player. @CAPS1 is a very boring ride. On the road I look for license plates in different states. We were halfway there so we stopped at a Dunkin' Donut, @CAPS1 Back at @TIME1 my sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate. Then we went to a bunch of small stalls where you have to show your passport to get in. Finally we are at @LOCATION2. We stayed there for @NUM3 or @NUM4 nights. Then we rode for another @NUM5 hours. Go to @LOCATION1. All the patience paid off when we got there. That's when I'm patient
This story is about when I was patient. I'm about @NUM1 years old. It's a beautiful day outside. The best part is it's my birthday. Suddenly, I had a brainstorm. I'm going to try to ride the bike without a secondary wheel. So I ran in as fast as my little feet let go of @CAPS9. I walked to @CAPS1 from the front door and yelled "@CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS7, I have something to tell you." "@CAPS4 is a friend" my @CAPS2 screamed and ran down the stairs. "@CAPS5 is @CAPS3" I shouted. "@CAPS6 here." "@CAPS7 darling, you have to go somewhere @CAPS4, it must be important that your son wants us here." "Yes, yes, yes,"" @CAPS7 Mom, we can meet him outside." "@CAPS8, we'll be outside" "OK" "@CAPS7 let's go." @CAPS9 and my @CAPS2 ran outside to wait for @CAPS3, that's me While waiting patiently.
Do you have a mom who is always busy? If not, I would. For some reason, I love traveling around with her. One day, we went to a place whose name I forgot. I am patient. It's a little hard to be patient because you really have nothing to do. @CAPS1 treats her as @NUM1. I was happy when we left, but I didn't say, come on, hurry up, @CAPS1 is taking a long time, @CAPS2 is hungry, @CAPS2 is ready to leave, etc.
When I was patient, I asked my mom to buy me a bike and I had to wait two weeks to get a bike for my birthday. I wanted a fish and I asked my mom to buy me a fish she didn't say anything so I kept asking and asking and asking so I stopped asking for three days and then she gave me a fish and it just died. Four weeks later I asked for a tortoise and she said yes she would, then I waited and waited and told her she gave me one and then I'm glad that was when I was patient.
Once my sister was with my mom and I went to Dix Sporting Goods and I wanted a new bag and Adidas sandals and crazy socks, I spent hours picking socks, zebra, stripes, blank , plaid and dots, so my sister didn't get anything because she didn't have the money. So in the end I just picked the zebra ones and then I had to find Adidas but then I couldn't find them so after about an hour there was only one left in my size but this girl took them off my feet Gone so I looked at my mom and she was in diapers and I went to get a bag and there was a pink one left in the bag so I grabbed it and went home.
I don't have much patience because this year I'm getting a laptop every day I'm looking for one I have my iPod and I've been talking to my family about it I think about my laptop every step of the way I'm ready All right, but I have to wait. Waiting for the laptop isn't the only thing I need to be patient with. Last year @CAPS1 I got the iPod but I had to wait until the eve of @CAPS1 because my family invested in what we bought on the black @DATE1 so I checked the youtube video on the iPod touch because I couldn't wait any longer . When you want something, it's hard to be patient if you already have it.
When you have patience, if you have no patience, you will keep running. (I have it here). You'll never have time for your family and yourself, as I told me at dinner "slow down, you're not going anywhere". If your food is going somewhere you won't because you're trying to make it. It's easy to take time to learn how to be patient along the way, and take your time.
One day my mom, dad and sister and I are going to @LOCATION1 to go somewhere unusual and it's a fascinating place. I was walking with my dad and he asked me if I wanted to ride this roller coaster called duling dragons @CAPS1 I'm not sure because it's my first time on a roller coaster so I said no but I don't know if I like roller coasters so I said ok let's go to the line at @CAPS2, we waited @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes during that time, I'll just watch other people out there turn around, I'm looking for a roller coaster for the first time from what I've seen Place is going @ NUM3 miles per hour so there are still @NUM4 people ahead of us so @CAPS2 is like when we went and it feels like time is getting slower and slower so @CAPS2 is like the last It's our turn ni @NUM5 times I collectively go to @CAPS1 it's ours ok it's fun then we're like @NUM6 mph I can't even scream we're so fast then we twitch upside down , and end @CAPS2, no no no, I love roller coasters, that's when I'm patient.
On the morning of @DATE1, everyone in my family woke up at @NUM1 or @NUM2. My siblings told my mom "@CAPS4 can play @CAPS1 and labtop." @CAPS2 said sure, but you have to wait until it's your turn", @CAPS4 said "okay". @CAPS3 @CAPS4 played it. Everyone Got an hour and a half to play both. I let my siblings play first because I'm getting older and I have to wait patiently until it's my town. Well, until it's my turn @CAPS4 wood has to play on this stuff, @CAPS4 will do it until the end of the day. Or until the tomoro is done. Until the next @DATE2 or until @CAPS4 can play it again. This is what I say I do at home Patience and respect for my brothers and sisters.
I have been patient many times. Once I put up with it for a whole month. I got a new basketball video game but it didn't come out until my mom got on it. So I have to be patient. I can't wait for the game to come out. It seems to have taken a long time. It was the day before the game was released and I lost the money I was going to use to buy the game. So I had to save @NUM1 more dolls to buy the games I wanted. I have to get two @DATE1 jobs to help me earn the money I lost. So two weeks ago I went to the game store to buy the game. When I walked into the store, the manager told me that there were no copies of any basketball games. So I have to put up with @NUM2 weeks more and I'm pissed. So I spent @NUM2 weeks playing this game and I finally got it. I was so angry that I had to endure it for so long, but I understood my anger. This is my story about patience.
Once when I was patient I was at my grandmother's house in @LOCATION1 and my cousins and I had to wait for my grandmother to come home @CAPS1 and we could go to the beach. After about an hour of waiting for my cousin and; started playing video games to entertain myself @CAPS1 time flies faster my grandma may have worked @NUM1 hours @CAPS1 3pm I decided to watch one of my favorites Patiently waiting movie for the whole movie, in the middle of the movie my grandma gets home @CAPS1 and we all wait patiently for her to be ready to go to the beach. This is my time to be patient.
I remember one time someone I knew was very patient with me. That was the start of @NUM1 grade. I signed up for a band that year and played the trumpet. We play songs and test everyone we play correctly. But on my test, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> found something interesting in my test. I played the wrong note. He told me that if I wanted to play my notes correctly, I would need a long private lesson. So an afternoon after school. I learned my lesson. I started playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> breaks down the notes for us. He told me the correct way to play the notes. He made me play these notes together again and again. When I screwed up, he showed me how to play them? ? Be patient with me. Then at the end I played every note. The class was about @NUM4 minutes and he was patient throughout. Now I play my notes based on the course and @PERSON1's patience. Now I know if I need more lessons later, I can count on <@NUM2</PERSON>'s patience to come out or have? ? Required course.
This year I tried out the @NUM1 volleyball team for my school. There are so many girls trying and I'm nervous about which team I'm going to join or even a team I'm going to form. So I did my best and I think, I've gained experience from other teams I've been on before, and I'm now confident I'll join this team. After @NUM2 tryouts, they divided us into The A, @CAPS1 or intermurural teams based on your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon and I got into the A team! Then we started practicing and playing. Win most games and improve your teamwork skills. Then a few days ago we played @ORGANIZATION1 Middle School. As North Middle School, W is clearly an opponent and determined to defeat them. We joke about "bragging," but most importantly, because we really want to be our best. The first game was very close, but we won and I played about half the time and survived, hitting and moving around the field. I felt very confident and in the second game as well, although I didn't play as much as I would have liked. I still had so much fun! In a volleyball game, you play a @CAPS2 game during the game. The best two in @CAPS2 win the game. At that time we won both games, we won, but we still had to play the third game. Even though we won games, our coaches want us to win all @CAPS2! She'll say, pretend it's a victory point and do your best. So when Game 3 started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited about halfway through the game and wondered when I would be able to play. Time has passed and I'm getting discouraged because I haven't played yet. I asked the coach a few times if I wanted to go in, but she was too busy watching and instructing. So I sat down and I pointed at about the end of the game and she looked at me and said, "Can you do it?" I shot straight and took it off. , and hit it! I have won! In the end, I learned to trust my coach and have patience because that's usually the best! But boy, I had a lot of fun serving the winning points. Really taught me a lesson!
The word patience means many things. This could mean waiting and so on. It also speaks a lot? ? ? This takes time and effort. I'm @CAPS1 the type who complains a lot and I'm impatient. Others they don't complain about them. Many teenagers are impatient. You develop patience as you get older, some adults don't, depending on how hard you work. It also depends on whether the person has experienced life.
My mom is the most patient person I know. When she sent me off to practice, she would wait two and a half hours for me to cheer and fly and dance. When I take science classes, she waits at least two hours to finish. Every morning, she would wait for me to get ready. After school she was waiting for me to buy something on the table in the hall. All she asks is for us to reciprocate the favor. She wouldn't rush us unless she was late. She always hugs us before we leave.
Patience When I don't want to go to Wisconsin, I am patient. I was patient on the way (driving) there. I had fun fishing and now it's boring not to complain. I don't want to sleep on @CAPS1 floor. I was patient throughout the camping trip. The story begins. @STATE1, it took @NUM1 hours. There was a TV in the car, I watched it for a while, then I looked outside and said a moose! I screamed, "Moose!!" My boyfriend in the room, Mike, stopped and stepped back, it was the first time I saw a moose. Then, when we got there, we pitched our tent and went fishing. I wait patiently for the woman who fishes to bite me. I was very patient and I caught @NUM2 fish that day. Then when we came back I had to sleep in the hinterland. I had bumps and rocks under my feet, but no complaints because of how he was synthesized. We were on our way back the next day and I couldn't see the TV or have a drink. I had to go to the bathroom. A sign says @CAPS2 station is at exit @NUM3''. I patiently went to the bathroom to drink water.
One day there was a little boy named @CAPS1. He was really hungry and his mom was a slow cooker. It takes her a long time to finish cooking. @CAPS1 is starving and he is getting really impatient with his mother @CAPS4 @CAPS1 going out and having friends. He came home hoping that dinner would be ready. He went into the kitchen and said, "Mom has dinner ready." "@CAPS3 now" Mom said. It will take another hour to be ready. @CAPS1 is thinking about what he can do before dinner is ready @CAPS4 He goes to play his video game. This is a spaceship game. This spaceship is shooting other spaceships to survive. @CAPS1 got bored @CAPS4 He went into the kitchen to see that dinner was ready. His mom didn't finish @CAPS4 @CAPS1 was patient, his mom did it in less than five minutes.
Patience is when you wait for something without complaining. When I was patient it was @NUM1 years old. It was about @NUM2 that day, but it was a bit windy. I'm patient and I can take the @LOCATION1 adventure. It was gleaming wood. The line is long, when I mean long. It took me about half an hour to get in the car. Another ride I'm waiting for is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. But that one is shorter. Only took about @NUM3 minutes. All these rides have to show patience, because if I don't show patience, I won't ride the rides well. The last one was when I @NUM4. I wanted to ride the Thunderhawk and the line took a full hour. I played my Nintendo while I waited so it could be patient. An hour later, out of patience, I got on that ride.
Patience is when you listen and tolerate someone's feelings. My mom and dad are very patient @CAPS1 and my sister. My webmaster just came to @CAPS1 us she is @NUM1 years old. She came to @CAPS2 to live @CAPS1 us. It's hard to @CAPS1 get an extra in the family you've always had @CAPS2 like an extra plate, spoon and fork pizza, supplies and what she needs for school. We have @CAPS2 work harder because we have @CAPS2 grt stuff, my sister doesn't do everything I use @CAPS2 My parents are more patient and forgiving @CAPS2 her, but I know why. Sometimes my mom and dad both cvantg and mean, but she'll get in trouble because she's older than me but doesn't use @CAPS2 because of the way we can do things at home. I look up @CAPS2 my parents and they are very nice to everyone @CAPS2 even? ? ? Knowing they still have patience is different.
I am impatient.
This is a story about what I had to endure. It happens every year and I'm sure everyone knows it. It's the phone birthday. Every year I have to wait @NUM1 days for my birthday. It will take a while, but I know I have to be patient. Patience is hard work, but it usually pays off. Another way I have to be patient is to wait for the @CAPS1 test to end. But I always remember it has to end at some point. So I have to sit there and do my work and be patient.
I play football for a rec.Team called Cheetah. Rec means I'm in the best partition you can get into. Rec football is fun, but my two best friends and I are doing all the work and the rest of the team is not doing anything. So I decided to try a select team. A select team is at the second highest level you can get into. When the tryouts came, I was really nervous. After I tried it for three days, if you were selected, you would get a call saying you joined the team. It took a long time to get a call and it felt like a country. Between those days, I had to wait, wait, wait, wait, and when you wait a long time, that's patience.
I think patience is when someone is able to wait and not complain. I've never been patient, so this is a story I made up. One day there was a girl named @CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework, housework, take care of her sister, and pack the rest of dinner. She is really busy. She starts with homework first because she has a math homework? @NUM1 questions. It's easy because they are? Addition and Subtraction. It took her @NUM2 minutes (@NUM3 minutes per side), which is not bad. Next she does housework. Her chores are cleaning her room and living room because her sister used to play with toys around here. Fortunately, my sister fell asleep. Now that she's resting instead of making a mess, @CAPS2 took @CAPS1 about @NUM4 minutes to clean up all these days because all she did was toss them back to the toy bar. Now, let's go to her room. Allied messy room, you can't open the door in the first place. So she had to put the door on until she finally got used to herself. The door slammed shut and the clothes on her clothes were shut, but luckily didn't wake her sister. @CAPS1 starts by listing the things she needs to do: vacuum, make the bed, put all the food in her room back in the kitchen. This took about @NUM5 and a half hours. So it's all about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she has to do is pack up the rest of dinner. Her mom can't because she has to fly her dad to work, so @CAPS2 it's up to her. But badly, they had Italian sausage for dinner, and her sister had spilled the house all over the floor, so she had to mop the floor. So it took her @NUM7 minutes to clean the table right away, @NUM4 minutes to mop the floor, and when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could take her to the park. She gave her some apples and when the apples were finally finished she took her sister and they had a great time.
I have had to endure a few times in my life. Sometimes we have to be patient with the doctor, waiting for new games and movies to be released. But I'm going to tell you about an experience I had to wait patiently at the airport. At one point I had to wait patiently at the airport. The problem was waiting for the plane to arrive or the queue for our tickets. We had to wait because all the planes were grounded. We had to spend the night there. I tried my best to be patient but my grandma didn't like that we had to wait over an hour to get into the food court and then another hour to get our food. It's very crowded and needs all the patience not to get mad at other people. Some examples of how I feel about my patients are doctor visits, long bus rides, maybe even waiting for test results, and many other things. Make sure you work for the patient and stay calm.
I think my trainer is patient because she is watching @NUM1 girls. She has to teach us something we don't know. Our trainers have taught us things like @CAPS1 races and taught us how to do crossovers and more. She taught us to run fast and she had to be patient with slow kids who couldn't run fast. Our coach has to be patient in handing out the jerseys because we all have to try all the jerseys and she has to be patient so she has to be patient.
None of us like to wait as much as we do, but we must learn to be patient. @DATE1 @DATE1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 I have to be patient with a lot of things when I go to @LOCATION1. I had to be patient while waiting at the airport and using public transport. Patience means you are understanding and forgiving. During my travels, I had to wait a lot at the airport. Although still patient. It is very important to wait while your flight is called to be an additional patient. Another area where patience was required was when I had to wait for my bag to come up from the luggage carousel. Waiting patiently at airport security was another long wait. All in all, you have. Patients waiting at the airport. When I go to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I have to be patient when using public transport. By the time the train arrives it is rush hour and the train is already full. There was traffic outside when I was in a taxi. I am relaxed and patient. All in all, I have to be patient when using public transport. I still don't like waiting in line, but I'm patient when I do. The wait was when I learned to be patient, but it`s something we have to do.
When my dad and I line up for the kencer hauck on the @LOCATION1 adventure! I had to wait patiently to get in the car. This line is huge for so many people? ? ? There are so many of us shocking? ? ? ? ? ? Queued for this roller coaster, we waited hours for what seemed like minutes, and as we got closer, it became harder and harder to wait patiently. Finally we got in the car and it was on the road and it was crazy, so wait those minutes that seem like hours? ? ? award? ? ? ? ? ?
Once I passed @ORGANIZATION1. We've got our food and we're waiting to get it so we can eat. We waited about ten minutes. Then our food finally came! We looked at the food they gave us and we got all the wrong food and no drinks. So my mom had to give it all back to them. This time we had to wait about fifteen minutes. So we wait and wait and wait. In the end they gave us food and this time we got the store we ordered. We finally left @ORGANIZATION2 and started eating. We also got ice cream after we ate. "@CAPS1 Good thing you guys are so patient. Thank you for your kindness!" that's what my mom told us when we got home. I am so patient.
(waiting) (healing beatina) "@CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS3 is your repolt line". @PERSON2hemlock said. I @PERSON1 was the last person in line. "@CAPS3 You go @PERSON1 @CAPS11 A' @CAPS12, keep up the good work!" @PERSON2 said. "@CAPS4!!!!" I screamed happily as I headed straight home A'@CAPS12" "@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @PERSON1. " @CAPS7 mom aya said. I called @CAPS7 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 said: "@CAPS9. I @CAPS10 @CAPS11 A' @CAPS12! But can I make old stuff for @MONEY1 from the internet? " "Why @CAPS13 is not a good fit for @CAPS11 A' @CAPS12 students." I placed an @CAPS7 order and I waited @NUM1 weeks...? ? ?
I was patient one time and when I was at a skateboard race at @CAPS1 the registration line was almost @CAPS2 I stood there for almost an hour but when I stood there and paid my fees it was all worth it Yes, because I got to compete with my best friend.
One time I was patient was at a @NUM1 birthday party I used to stay in and I was waiting in line and the line was about a mile long so I waited and waited and I ended up looking for my ticket and forgot I left it in the car so I had to go all the way back. So then I came back and it was twice as big and then I waited for a while and it sucked and then it started raining out of nowhere and I didn't have an umbrella and I was still waiting. How could it get worse? Well, they did close the concerts. So I came home soaked with my feet and hands. So I just lay down to sleep and relax. PS Worse day of my life.
Me, my patience is too small. I mean almost none. As I waited, I had a strange feeling, almost like a toothache. Weird, right? Well, you get the idea, let me tell you a story about my impatient patience. That was @DATE1, and I attended the @CAPS1 Security Course by @ORGANIZATION1. We have just completed the test that determines the success or failure of the course. They took out the names of the first people who passed along with their certificates. By the way, everyone is outside fetching water. The first group completed @NUM1 minutes. It takes approximately @NUM2 minutes to score the test and five minutes to award the award. Unfortunately, my group was the last. We all sat on the bench for three hours! My patience is completely gone, I just started rocking @CAPS2 back and forth, my team is finally called up, and we've got an award! Thank goodness my patience has gotten better @CAPS3 since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I hit the partridge, and a @NUM3 point buck. This is my story, good night!
I have to be patient as I take @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I am patient as I have to wait for my classmates to finish their @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Sometimes I have to wait forever. But that's okay, I can take a nap. I hate patience sometimes. This frustrates me. Waiting like @NUM1 minutes just for people to finish the test. That's fine because you shouldn't rush @CAPS1. It frustrates me that people take so long. Not only at school, but also at my house. Doctors, dentists at friends' houses and libraries. Man, it's hard to be patient. But patience is not good. I want people to be as fast as me during testing. Then I don't have to be very patient. Oh, I guess I'm just going to deal with it, it's so patient.
Patience is a good thing. Good things come from patience, bad things don't happen. But what is patience? Patience is the ability to handle problems without whining and complaining. Patience is being able to wait while others cannot. Some people are impatient, like my dad sometimes. For a month or so, he's been saving up for the new @CAPS1. Once he's had enough, he gets a new "@NUM1" flat screen @CAPS1, but if he waits another week or so, he can get a screen about a foot larger for the same price. Let's say your little sister is bagging you and you beep nicely to get her to stop, but she just won't. So instead of going completely mad at her which will get you into a lot of trouble, just wait for your parents to come home so she will get into trouble and you won't
Once upon a time there was a girl named @PERSON2. She has always dreamed of being a princess. Every gift she received was either a dress or a piece of jewelry. She likes to try on clothes. She has two sisters @NUM1 (one year older than @PERSON2) named @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. @CAPS3 house is an old house in the woods. One day @PERSON2 was out to pick up the mail and a man in a tuxedo gave her a fancy looking letter. @PERSON2 opened the letter and read it aloud, it read "@CAPS2 @PERSON2, you are invited to a ball at the castle @NUM2pm on @DATE1." @PERSON2 squealed with excitement. @PERSON2 decided to go to the mall to find a ball gown. She found a beautiful dress, but it was a lot of money. She asked the lady at the front desk if there was any way they could lower the price if I helped out in the store for a few days. She accepted the offer. She worked two days and a few hours. Her patients paid off. She can take the dress home with her. She drove home and got dressed. She only has an hour, so she has to hurry. She put on makeup, put on jewelry, looked at herself in the mirror, and said I did it. She got in the car and drove to the castle, and the moon was so beautiful against the gold paint. @PERSON2 got out of the car and walked into the castle. She walked down the stairs and everyone was staring. It was the best day of her life for @CAPS3 and made everyone think she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with a few men. The prince steps up to introduce himself, and when she turns around, he falls in love. @PERSON2 Can't believe the prince will talk to her. He asked her to dance. They dance all night. When the prince came to power, he called her name and she came on stage. He asked her if she would marry me and she said yes. She became a princess! Sometimes dreams do come true.
One time I had to be patient and I had to babysit the kids. My family friends have a one year old @CAPS1 and I have a six year old brother. I had to take care of them both because my mom and her boyfriend were going on dates with our family and friends. All was well until they left. When my brother was in preschool at @CAPS2 they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do and I had to help him. @CAPS2 I thought it would be easy, @CAPS2 I got him to read the book, my mom told me he knew @CAPS2 I didn't have to read every single one, I had to he won't do the job and the baby won't stop crying , the dog won't stop barking (he hates baby crying), the house is crazy! @CAPS2 I'm starting to panic. what should I do? And I'm not ruining my mom's plans, I definitely want to prove her wrong. @CAPS2 I calmed down and remembered that one of our friends said he told me to be patient. @CAPS2 I put the dog outside, picked up the baby, and went back to the table where my brother was playing. First I read the book aloud, which caught their attention. Then I told Andy to make the work a game and it was all good. Then @CAPS4 time came @CAPS2 I made some food we both loved and put the baby in his high chair and handed the food to my brother and I turned and he threw me the plate and it was all over the place food! I got mad and told myself to be patient, I cleaned up the mess and fed the kids a movie and they all felt asleep! I quietly cleaned the house and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised I did. Patience is an important part of life, and if you lose your temper, it will only make things worse.
One day, my mother came home from get off work. She came in and said, "@CAPS1, do you want to go shopping @CAPS2 or later?" I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed clothes and we went to the store. It's around @NUM1, so it's rush hour. It seems like it's taking a long time, I'm going crazy. Then my mom said be patient, it will be over soon. This is when I have patience. Ten minutes later, things started to clear up. It's still going to be a while, but things are getting better. We were parked in the @LOCATION1 car park in less than twenty minutes. There are a few cars in the parking lot, but it doesn't look like many. I was really pissed when we entered the store. Lines for your purchases run all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said "@CAPS2 look. The lines are long, you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?" "I'll try". I say. After entering the store, we were looking for my clothes and we were also looking at the long line to see if they had dropped some. We got my clothes and got in line. We spent about an hour queuing, which made me mad. Not only did it make me angry, but it made me anxious because I skipped lunch. We were happy and hungry as we walked out of the store. We left the store for @CAPS3.Donalds. As we walked down the street from @ORGANIZATION1 there was a circular line and we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and realized that was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We've got a lot and I'm sure I'll have more patients. So we waited and the line went fast. We got up to find the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us food. When we got the food, the lady said "@CAPS4 for your patients". She then asked if we wanted a free serving of chips of any size to wait for us. We told her yes, we'd have a big fries. My mom turned to me and said, "If you're patient, do you know what's going to happen?" I said yes, it's good to have patients. That's when I have patience.
While I was patient, I had trouble with football. I need help with everything. But my dad helped me. He taught me how to play, run and Carney. I was patient because I watched them I did. I saw a guy who was helping my dad play and we went out to join them. What he gave me was hard, but it helped.
Patience may be one of the most important things in your life. Most people will probably prefer you if you're patient, for example, if you're waiting in line for something at school, and you're patient, you might get "@CAPS1 you" from one of your teachers because you're very Be patient. You always have patience, weather or not, if it's at school, with a fun park ride ahead, and behind a group of people, you'll want to be patient, because if you're not, you won't You're going to be humiliated trying to drop it in front of everyone, cut it open in front of them, and possibly be thrown out of the ammo park in front of everyone. That's why I think patience is important.
Fishing is a great sport but requires a lot of patience. My first fishing trip was on a lake about @NUM1 miles from my house. I've loved fishing since then, but the trip wasn't easy. I think fishing is fun because I do what I do patiently and it takes all my patience. When my uncle visits from @LOCATION1 he always brings his fishing rod and fish. I didn't go with him until about a year ago. He decided I should bring a friend. So if I get bored, I'll talk to someone. Patience kicks in when we're halfway there, @CAPS1! We hit the fence. The car broke down, so we called the land to rest. Wait about @NUM2 hours, @NUM3 minutes, my friend asked. So is my friend. We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way. Once there, we had two problems to solve, and we had no bait. We found a nice spot on the other side of the lake. We had to do sea revenge for some bait and it took about @NUM4 hours to get enough bait. We are finally ready to fish. We got the rod, sat in the chair, threw it, and waited. There was no way to make the fishing faster, so we sat down and hoped for a bite to eat. Finally, my uncle, my friend and I caught @NUM5 fish! We had three for lunch and went home with @NUM6 fish. I like to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could happen, but we went fishing, relaxing, and brought a few meals. That's why I fish because it requires patience.
Once I had patience it was my birthday and I retweeted @NUM1. I was so excited because I knew I got a phone and that's what I wanted. All my friends have them, I just want one because if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn't know where I was. This is only needed now because they are very helpful. My birthday is on @DATE1 so the night before my football game everyone is asking if I'll get me and I keep telling them yes I'll get it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs. The first gift I got was a cell phone and I was really happy, I started getting all my friends' numbers. I know you get what you want when your patients don't ask you.
One day my brother and I asked my dad to let us stop gaming so we chilled a weaker gaming game controller and he was a little sad but so we rode Pasim about lommits four and then We went swimming to win so then he wasn't red so we played with my dog Messi and he finally got red so we went to game stop to get control and they didn't hurt it so we went @ CAPS1 boster, they had it so we got the controller, but they didn't, so we went back to @CAPS1 boster's house, they got it, so we got the controller, and went home and put the game in place, which Just my pashint all day. The best we are pashint is to keep your ego okupid going
My grandma waited patiently for @NUM1 months because she had a big check with a fluffy look like they misspelled her last name so every time they re-tip had to call back and re-tip, they would Making the illusion five times in a row and taking a long time to complete, we need to pay for our medicine so we don't get kicked out. We also need a new car and clothes. Our car was ready and our clothes were growing out. When my grandmother finally got her check, we went out the hard way and bought a brand new car. and clothes. I think my grandmother was very patient after they had to redo it more than five times and I knew I couldn't be that patience without losing it.
This story is about when I was patient. I was right to be patient. I'm waiting patiently for @CAPS1. I'm not that kind of person? ? ? Be patient. When I want something, I am that second. Christmas Eve is my favorite holiday. There's a lot of good stuff about it. There are cokkies, family and gifts. There are always questions, my problem is that I love trying to figure out what my gift is. That's the stench of patience, you're always waiting for something good to happen. My family knows not to put anything in the bag for me as I will easily look in the bag and if they are not well packaged I will find a small seam in the wrapper. The most impatient time is the night before opening the gift. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your gifts are yelling not to leave them unwrapped. It seems that all vacations are like this. Well, I guess we all have to be patient with my patience with @LOCATION1 football winning @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 and flordia gators. Ficst @ORGANIZATION1 must get rid of @CAPS5 bold game.
SUBJECT: Write a story about patience in your own way @CAPS1 Have you ever met someone @CAPS1 patient? Well, I @CAPS1. @CAPS5 Neighbors can't wait for football tryouts to score. He practiced juggling and moves all day. Trial day has come. He went juggling, talked to the coach, cut some moves, and went home. " It's going to be a couple of weeks to see if you're on the team @CAPS3 "@CAPS2," @CAPS3 @CAPS5, "I can't wait that long". He came back and told me all about it. " I @CAPS1 waited for weeks," he @CAPS3. So I told him to be patient. The more you complain about me @CAPS3, the more disappointment you get. So he went home and practiced a move he couldn't do. A few days later. "@CAPS4" @CAPS5 friends screamed "I made it" from one side when I suddenly stepped aside, and I just smiled and said when I @CAPS3 "Patience works".
The one time I was patient was when I was @NUM1 and I found my @NUM2 fish. I went fishing with my dad my uncle bout my dad stopped the bout we were going fishing my dad helped me put on my life jacket then he beat my pocil. Then cast it out for me, my dad caught them like @NUM2 @NUM4 like crazy, he got about @NUM5 fish, he told me to be "patient", it's my @NUM2 time because my dad Was packing them up and I was sitting there waiting and all of a sudden my chest fell off and asked my dad what kind of fish it was and he said it was a blue gill and he said it was a good catch so My dad and I loved it and went fishing again. That's when I had to endure.
Write when I am patient. In my old school before this school, I was patient with all the @NUM1 in some @NUM2 dancers, I told them not to fight, so I held my patient in it and the teachers were talking to They talk about me seeing them outside and they don't do anything to me so I don't know how they try to make the school happy.
Patience Everyone knows what it is and how we stay focused, it's like waiting on the unemployment line for us to wait, because patience keeps us from getting angry, but if we wait a long time, it's more likely to get angry. When you wait, you also show care that you know the person in front of you, you wait and wait for your turn because waiting and patience allow you to absorb what's around you and see things you've never seen in your life when your Patience Showing Graduation to the People in Front of You What you see is seeing it, even if you already know what it is, Graduation shows respect and trust and is a way of being polite and patient with the people in front of you. When you have patience you don't have to rush it because you have a lot of time and no matter how long your patient is for you the longest and you bring about speeding up time through impatience, patience is a big thing because Patience will give you what you want or need many times. I think patience is important because you never know who is patient with you, so you should be patient with others.
The first time I had patience was when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get the @DATE1 film from my camera, my mom always promised me to get the film, but it felt like her money was spent? ? ? She told me to wait @DATE1 @DATE1. So I waited @DATE1 @DATE1 cried and this is what happened and I asked my mom again, can I get my film out of the camera? She said no because she used her money? ? ? school supplies. I happened to wait for another @DATE1 @DATE1 so @DATE1 @DATE1 came again. I asked her and she said no because once again she didn't spend money from someone who helped her like any father. So I had to wait until the next @NUM1 @DATE1 so I waited and waited and finally @NUM1 @DATE1 passed and she forgot so she had to go get groceries. So @DATE1 I asked her again and she said. Yes, but she has to pay back my father's help and then she said me after school? ? ? Get my film roll out and buy it. So how do I tell you what happened now? ? ? I've been waiting to do this too and had to buy a new digital camera because it's been thrown away so many times.
Every day I post, I have to wait patiently to be called in for lunch. You really have to be patient especially when you're waiting in line. But sometimes you're lucky and you can go to another line to pay for lunch. Then when you're done with lunch you can go out for a ride. But @CAPS1 you have to eat the food and throw it away, be patient. That's when I'm patient.
I was patient on the plane to @LOCATION1. All I did was stare at the towers and buildings as I left. I'm also patient when it comes to my little brother. Lots had a fly shot and I had to wait in the lobby. I was most patient when my brother went through my patient with him, breaking all my stuff, biting me with his toys, and he kept whining or crying about what he wanted.
My family and I went to @LOCATION3 for a few weeks during @DATE1. At the beginning of the second week, I did something I had never done before. My two sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), dad, cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2's uncle (@CAPS1) and I are on our way to the boat. I'm so excited, this is my first time fishing in the sea. Hours passed and we didn't catch anything, but we were still drinking coffee while telling jokes and doing little pranks like pulling someone else's line to make them think we caught something. We left at @NUM1 am and it is now @NUM2 pm. We caught nothing but dad and @CAPS1 have been fishing and said we just need to be patient. After about @NUM3 minutes, the @CAPS3 wire started pulling @CAPS1 to help her get it in, a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was very patient, but no one grabbed anything else. It's @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. Nice to @PERSON2. Everyone was patiently waiting to grab something, but @PERSON2 was also very patient as she had to use the bathroom most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us had to sneak to the bathroom after so many hours on the boat. When we got home we told everyone what we caught and it was nothing to everyone except @PERSON3 and her little clams. I know a lot of people who won't stick in that boat for an hour. So I'm so proud of everyone's patience and I hope to do it again next time I go to @LOCATION2 with my family.
Being patient is not an easy task. In order to be patient, self-control is required. Patience is very important because if you have gon? ? ? And your impatient maugio won't hire you waiting for you to come here, this is not looking for an impatient person. First off, my family and I are going to @LOCATION1 but we have to leave @DATE1 am so I can't sleep. I woke up at @TIME1am so I'm tired. I can't nap because if I do it turns into a deep sleep. Next I and finish packing ?????????? so I'm really tired, ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shows I was run because there is an hour left. when i finish packing. I started watching TV to keep me awake because I couldn't sleep under ?????????. Then my cousin had to change the diaper so I'm going to change it, but @CAPS1 when I'm @CAPS1 I'm going to get ????????????????? call and say "we Let's go." I'm happy because now I can sleep in the rental van. All in all, I have to be patient, but it's really hard to do when you're really sleepy. I've tried different ways to keep me awake and it works great. What really pissed me off was that I had to change the dipper, but how I was patient.
Me, my sister and I were all outside @CAPS1 while she had a great day. My mom said the back of the shed was wide. She was a few hours late to the store and she wasn't hot at all. She said @CAPS2 is my sister's but she said she won't open @CAPS2 until her birthday. Her birthday is in a few weeks. She said she couldn't wait that long and strode away. After a few days, she decided to wait patiently. She thinks days will be in radius. They did it to her stick, but not fast enough. My mom to me her body is waiting on boy goals. @CAPS2 It's hard to get her to go to her house, isn't she??? I was going to? ? ? . I have decided? ? ? We came to the cream and said the way home. Finally @CAPS2 is her birthday and she's the screed lad. She turned on all her girls except one. Hot sitting thinking about me and her. She takes medicine and rips @CAPS2. One when she opens @CAPS2, she just stares. In silence she said. "@CAPS2's just clothes". I can tell she doesn't like @CAPS2. "I can't stand clothes for so long." I burst out laughing. I think @CAPS2 is a banana. Tell me not to get used to the patient house after I stop laughing and you may never be again.
Have you ever been in a situation when you knew something good was about to happen or was about to happen and you just @CAPS1 couldn't control yourself? You ask your parents, "when" and they say, "be patient soon!" Well, that's happened to me a lot, like when we're going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but in this For special occasions, we are bringing our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and have patience. It was @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was so excited that my family was getting a dog that day. My stomach is full of butterflies trying to fly out and explode in bliss. Everyone else in my family was the same, but it was then that I remembered that my goal was to be a mature teenager and patient. So I continue with my normal routine. Eat breakfast, brush your hair, get dressed, brush your teeth, go to school. Later, when I got home, my mom announced that my dad would arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat in my chair, in my room, looking at the clock tic and toc about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked into the living room, where my family was sitting, waiting for me to hear the door slam. Sudden. Prosperity! The door slammed shut on my dad's truck. When I was just walking over to see the puppy, my mom, brother and sister rushed to the door. "Wow!" everyone screamed. "@CAPS1 I hold her", "She's my dog" and "Let's name her" also featured in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, stood silently, and handed me the dog. "You're so patient, you @CAPS1 hug her first!" I'm so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the first to hug her. Patience @CAPS1 pays off!
I'm patient when I shovel sleds at a friend's house in the winter so we can water them to make ice. When it gets difficult where we shovel snow, we have to go through a lot of snow to get a nice layer of snow to put a lot of water on. When I'm impatient. It took us hours to complete it. But I kept telling myself to be patient. The only reason I lost a patient was because it was getting dark and I had to leave as soon as possible. But before I got impatient we finished it and I'm glad we finished the icy trails. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice, but that didn't bother me at all. That's how I patiently accomplished a great and fun thing that day. But...I couldn't, or we couldn't go on that night because it was too late. me this is my story about patience @ CAPS1
Patience is a big part of life, I learned @DATE1 during hunting season. Most of the @DATE1 we sat saw everything but the deer. We got to the point where we didn't want to go again, but we went anyway. As the weather got colder, we started to see some. My stepdad @PERSON1 said if we don't see the money, we will shoot one on @DATE2. A few days later it's @DATE2 and we're shooting a doe, but we haven't seen anything for most of @DATE2. With @NUM1 minutes left in the @DATE2 light, the perfect Bucks walked into the field.
One day my mom and brother were driving our car. We were on our way to the beach when our car suddenly stopped moving. The battery is dead and not working. My mom called a tow truck and said he won't be here for two hours! My brother and I kept complaining but my mom just sat quietly so when the truck (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3) came to us. I was amazed by my mother's patience.
One time I was on my way to the bus stop and I got their @NUM1 minutes before the bus came, so I sat at them, I checked my watch, it's been @NUM2 minutes I support getting on the bus , so I waited and waited, so I pressed my watch again and it was @NUM3 minutes past my time to get on the bus. So I grew up domestically, but I thought the bus was fine? ? ? I sat down and I wanted because I ???? going??? I became very patient and after another @NUM4 minutes the bus came and it set me free because I was the only one left People at the station? So when I got home my mom asked me what was wrong and I said the bus was late @NUM5 minutes she said what did you do I said I waited and they let me free she said that's what you get for your patience.
I'm in line for a drive at @LOCATION1 Adventure. I'm just waiting for them to get impatient. But suddenly, I see the line move. So I calmed down and waited, it was our turn to ride. I just realized we've been waiting for an hour. Patience means you know why you have to endure their waiting. Because you can't push or squeeze to the front of the line. Tolerance means you can't do or get things you don't want to do unless you whine. You can't hit, cut, push or squeeze to the front of the line, you just have to wait.
Patience requires a lot of tolerance. It's hard to be patient with @CAPS6 for most people, but sometimes @CAPS6 is very important. My neighbor really needed a break from her @NUM1 year old daughter @CAPS1 a few weeks ago. I am happy to provide a babysitter as I enjoy being with her. I have absolutely no idea what @CAPS2 I'm going for. She came over around noon and we played for a few hours. But then she became grumpy. I gave her refreshments but it didn't help. She started crying so I'm not sure what to do @CAPS2 out loud. My mom rushed into the room in a panic. "Is @CAPS2 still going? Is everything okay here?" she asked. I told her everything was fine, but @CAPS1 was really cranky. My mom replied, "Let's take her to the park and she'll have a good time there!" I agreed and we were off. If noticed @CAPS1 likes to do things by himself. She insisted on completing her car seat, swing and puzzle. It takes a lot of patience because she takes forever. I love watching @CAPS1, but @CAPS6 will be very difficult if I don't have the patience.
Going out hunting requires patience. After about @NUM1 deer seasons, my patience is gone. I ran @NUM2 with a bow and walked out. He was about @NUM3 yards from my stand, I called him closer. Then he was @NUM4 yards from my stand. I took the photo, he gave in, and my @NUM5 minutes waiting to find him felt like I was in my lifetime. Then I got off my stand and he ran about @NUM6 yards and fell. when I walked up to him. I'm excited because instead of winning @NUM2, he got @NUM8. Remember to use regin blood head and be patient you can shoot deer for a lifetime.
This is a story about patience. Patience is required in life. Sometimes when you're feeling very frustrated, you need to be patient. One reason is that if someone or something makes you angry, you need to be patient or you will get into trouble. For example, if you get mad at someone and start a fight, you're going to be in huge trouble. Or if you try to do something and can't, you need patience or you might break something and get into trouble. Another reason to be patient is if you're working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so that if they can't do the right thing, you don't hurt their feelings. They may get angry and don't want to be with you. The third reason for patience is that if you know someone who keeps making you angry or humiliating you, you need to be patient with him/her. Ignore this person so neither of you will get in trouble. If you don't have the patience, things can come to an end. So that's why you should be patient. Without patience, you can get into trouble, lose friends, and many other things that can go wrong. That's why you need patience.
I have a lot of patience, like I really want to know @CAPS1 I was on the volleyball team, I have patience, I have no complaints. I believe that being patient is a matter of respect for oneself and others. I did a test one time and really wanted to know when we'd get it, but I'm patient. Others are impatient, they keep asking what we want @CAPS1 and they all complain they are impatient. Another example is we're going to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1, we're still planning for the day I don't have a ruler, which makes things worse, has patience to think more, which makes it work. Men @CAPS1 sometimes more patient and patient, sometimes not so much
I woke up around @NUM1 o'clock not feeling well. I'm at my friend @CAPS1's house. I tried to wait until he woke up but I couldn't wait so I woke her up. I told her I wanted to go home so I was mom and my mom came to pick me up around @NUM2. I told her I thought I was ground????????? I had to wait until we finally got home and it took about two hours to arrive? ? ? Throwing up I'm so scary? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? illegible
My mom was patient with me and my brother because of all the fighting going on here and people were killed and she didn't like us going to places like this and we came home late
There was a time when I didn't want to endure, but had to. Our family is going on vacation to @PERSON2 common. When we were on the highway, two were nurtured and pulled over about @NUM1 yards ahead of us. Are they there? with anger. Soon, the police came. Remember, we've been waiting for this all. The police investigated everything and called something. @NUM2 minutes later, a truck goes around the traffic jam and starts building the road. I don't know why there is nothing to fix. Finally got around and we were let go and continued on to @PERSON1.
A lot of people are good at patience, I'm not that good at it. But when you travel long distances, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, sister, and sometimes dad, and I drive to @LOCATION2's house. She lives about @NUM1 hours from @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves family visits so we don't mind spending a weekend visiting her every few months. I must have been there at least @NUM2 times in my life. My mom worked the night shift at a famous hardware store. Usually, she works from @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. So when she got off work, we would pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 for fun. But most of the time I was sleeping. Once, I drank a lot of soda and was very excited. I am annoying my mother. So, I put my @CAPS3 in to make me happy. But most of the time I was sleeping. Once, I drank a lot of soda and was very excited. I am annoying my mother. So, I typed my @CAPS3 and started singing along to the song like an idiot. Until, my @CAPS3 died. I feel like my heart is a little broken. I can't sleep now. I'm still very excited. I started listening to the radio, but all we could hear was the countryside. Since, we're going to @CAPS7, we're moving away from the control tower of the cool radio station. Finally, we arrived at "The up @CAPS7 store" and when we go to @LOCATION2's we always stop to buy oil and food. I got @CAPS8 and more pop. I let out a little evil laugh to myself as I handed things to my mom. In the car, I finished my meal and got bored again. There was nothing in that car. I was angry at the time. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon, I fell asleep. I was woken up by the sound of us pulling into the driveway and my @LOCATION2 ran up to meet us. Finally, there we are. I survived and biked to @LOCATION2's house. Then I remembered, we have to drive home too. Although I take this trip a few times a year, I'm almost certain that I'll never get bored on the road. Be patient, not one of my favorite things to do.
I want to go to the movies. There is no movie I want to watch at home. "@CAPS1 Dad, can I go to the movies with someone?" I asked. "@CAPS2!." @CAPS3 replied. Which movies have I checked and they are a good choice. I choose the movies I want to watch. Then I realized I needed someone to accompany me. I called my friend @CAPS4 and asked her if she wanted to see the movie I wanted to see. In the end she wanted to see it and she said yes. After that, I ate something and relaxed. In a blink of an eye, it was time to leave. I run behind. I'll be ready soon and go pick up @CAPS4. Unlike me, she is calm and patient. In her position, I would not. That's one of the reasons I love @CAPS4 as a friend.
Do you have a patient? I have a lot? patient. I? ? ? Willing to do anything for a long time. Where you have patience, you have to wait for what you are waiting for or needing.
One time the patient was me when I went to the optical store and I had to get approval to get the glasses. So the next day my grandma called to ask if @PERSON1 was approved and they said "@CAPS1" and my grandma asked how long I had to wait and they said four weeks so a week passed and they called and said my glasses were done . So we went and picked them up the next day and that's when I had the patience.
"@CAPS1" I fell to the ground again. I'm trying to go all out cheering. The front is full of big twists and turns in the air. I'm almost gone, just can't get down. My gymnastics coach has been very patient with me, he's been working with me for about a month, and that's about it. I want to make him proud, he is like my brother. His name is @LOCATION1 and I've known him since 3rd grade. Whenever he saw me, he would say "My baby!" and give me a hug and a kiss on my forehead. @PERSON1 can do a lot of amazing things, he's been in a lot of competitions. He taught me the backhand, which was the first skill I mastered. His patience helped me, but sometimes it didn't. I'm glad he's patient, but sometimes he's just too patient. Sometimes I'd rather let him push me tighter. Whenever I feel like he's disappointed in me, I feel bad. When I feel that way, I always give it my all. It's a wonderful feeling when you get it for him. "@CAPS1" I feel my but again. It's no longer the normal, enthusiastic "try again", it's flat and boring. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline is pumping. I am going to get this! When I run and jump everything is fine. I made it and landed! Anyway, about a second. My feet slipped, and from under me, @PERSON1 ran towards me smiling. He was proud of me even though I didn't stick with it. We've been working on it and finally I got it! I'm really happy to tell my cheerleader, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1.
Last time @CAPS3 my mom ordered @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I'm patient with the whole @CAPS3. A @CAPS3, months, four and five months to be exact. why? Well, this game was released on @DATE1 at @CAPS3 and I had to wait. How do I pass the time? Very simple, don't think about the game, try not to talk about the game, only write when it comes up on the daily calendar. Even I beat the game exactly 32 times on every difficulty without any help. (Hehe, hehe!) I'll have to wait another month or so for the callop responsibility: @CAPS4. So this, ah, stinks, because now I can't stop thinking about it.
Everyone should be patient. Living patiently will help you because sometimes you have to be patient. Sometimes some people can be patient and some people can't, and I'm one of them. Many times I can be patient but not patient. Patience is a difficult thing for me to overcome. Well I don't! This time I am the patient in my life. At that time, many old people came in through the door, and finally the door was supported by everyone. It wasn't easy because I had to go to an @CAPS1 appointment in about @NUM1 minutes and it was a lot. Took about @NUM2 minutes waiting for them all to go through the door. But I still keep holding the door after holding the door I'm late for my @CAPS2 dppointment all it still does if a commin ?? holding the door
The one time I had the patience was last year when I @LOCATION2 callnt cedarpaint an amusement park. I'm in line for a great lollermaster called @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 force. It was a very tuff ride, and very enjoyable? inside? ? But that was ten hours long. It hurts, scary to stand on unbearable hotlines, usually at @LOCATION1
I have to be patient when I go to get my new phone because my grandmother likes to work with a narrow-minded person. The guy my grandma and I have been waiting for by the name of @CAPS1 finally came to us so we got to the stage I wanted and he said it for a long time but my grandma said if I'm not patient I can't get it My new phone the other day. We went to the counter and he was showing something about the phone and I wanted to get out of there so I could see for myself. My grandma and I finally left, I got my new phone and I love it. Name a time you were patient and why you were patient!
When I'm patient I'm seeing a doctor. It took a long time for the doctor and I was patient and I was patient to get the doctor back to the room. I'm @DATE1 @TIME1 and my mom and I went to the doctor because I have an apontment. I got a call from them and the doctor called me and took me to a room like @NUM1 minutes later he came back. We were all waiting for me during that time and my mom was talking. I love things that take so long, my mom said I don't know , but wait. Then the doctor came and started asking me what I was eating, what I was doing for exercise, and what I said. I have no idea. Then after they did an analysis of the quads, they said sorry to keep you patient and gave my mom some documents and then we went downstairs and I had to go to the lab for blood. They had a lot of people and I was patient and then they called me down and got blood and that's when I was patient with my mom at the doctor.
We'll be patient, and my patience in the middle is just waiting or just sitting with someone you don't like. Once when I was very young, I was not very patient. My mom wanted to say a few seconds and I'd say @NUM1. But as I got older, I was more patient. Like, I'm very patient with teachers and peers and parents, but sometimes I still have an impatient side and I try not to be impatient, but sometimes it happens. I like having people talk to, but sometimes I can't talk to them because I don't have the patience. My friends are really nice to start with, although sometimes they don't and it's fun to go out. I have a lot of friends because I'm an extrovert and sometimes I get into trouble because I'm an extrovert but also have a radical side. I love talking and having fun, maybe it would be more fun if I was more patient. I work hard. I think I can do better than I've always been, and maybe if I get more patient I'll get better at school, but I know I'll try to be as patient as I can. In conclusion, I need more patience, but patience is something I can work on with determination.
patience. Wow, you want to criticize; are you sure? Since you want it, it seems I have to give it to you. Patience is what @CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunts and even you and I need (@CAPS1 in these days and times. We need it almost every day.) @CAPS2 What does the keyword patience mean? Patience means you are understanding and forgiving. It also means you're having a hard time without complaining. Or in my own words, suffer long term, or wait until what you want @CAPS2 to accomplish. Being patient is not something I do all the time, it is something that needs to be done. Like my dad always said to me, you won't always get or get everything you want, so you have to learn to be patient . This is a word I don't like about @CAPS1 because it's what I really want. So this is how my story about patience explained me.
Sometimes I have to be patient when I have to be patient in class. I don't have much patience. I have to be patient with @NUM1 blocks @NUM1 blocks are moths. We have @PERSON1 as students. @PERSON2 keeps talking. He kept talking for about half an hour. So I have to wait a while until he gives us work. I am so patient. All in all, I have to be patient during class. Although I have no patience at all, but in class I have.
"@CAPS1 will be late!" yelled my little cousin @PERSON1 across the room. She was wearing her big blue snow coat and cute red boots. She started jumping around and it made me laugh easily. "@CAPS1 will be late!" yelled my little cousin @PERSON1 across the room. She was wearing her big blue snow coat and cute red boots. She started jumping around and it made me laugh easily. You see, I'm on a ski trip with my Pals, my cousin @PERSON1 and her parents. I am very enthusiastic. My parents spent a lot of time talking to @PERSON1's parents before we left, so @PERSON1 kind of complained about not going right away. I tried it? ? ? ? "@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3? I patted her on the shoulder and asked safely. Her eye seams tripled when I said that." @CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4! Madison yeah! I want to play, I want to play! " @PERSON1 shouted???. Although her voice sounded like "? ? ? " I smiled and we started the tro play. Will she guess??? I'll let her win.??? Is that so? I think I help her play the game to make her leave more patiently. Finally my parents go Outside, we started our ski tour. Patience paid off.
Once, when my little brother was taking a shower, I was so patient that I had to go to the bathroom. So I waited and of course he locked the door so I tried picking it with a toothpick and it didn't work. Then I told my dad he said "be a man who can hold it back" so that didn't work so I was about to take the door off its hinges and he came out and smiled at me and then I went into the bathroom and it was soaked with water, so I yelled at him, that's my patience.
I always have to be patient. This is because I have an older brother who doesn't do what he says. Let's say my dad asks him to clean the bathroom, well, it takes ten minutes for him to get up, and then I have to go while he cleans, and he won't let me. So I am one of the reasons. The other is my sister who is always on the phone so I hardly use it. So I waited until my parents got home, so they yelled at him to get him out of the car, which is why I was very patient.
That was @DATE1 and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank the hot chocolate. I see our @DATE1 tree full of gifts and can't wait to open them. I've been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didn't stop my hope. So I hope to have one this year. After a while, my parents said that @CAPS2 could open our present. "@CAPS1" I screamed, and I quickly ripped off the gift paper to find I got a makeup kit, a digital camera, and more. But not wii. I am so sad. So I asked my mom @CAPS2 if I can buy a wii tomorrow. But she replied, "@CAPS2 can't afford it. When @CAPS2 gets enough money, @CAPS2 will buy it. Well, I'm patient, so I guess I can wait. Because @CAPS2 all love our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watching TV. Then after a week or so my parents got paid so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy a wii. "@CAPS3" thank you "mom" and I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived?? I got Got the wii and it??, it's @MONEY1. I can't believe my patient finally got the payoff. Now that I got my new wii, @CAPS4 is enjoying every second of it.
Many people in the world have patience. But I think my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think it's because she was born into a dimension where she had to be patient with food, money and water. She can't just go out and buy food at the grocery store. She has to have the patience to cook her own food. If she wanted popcorn, she'd get some corn husks and put them in a pot and make a fire, who knows how long that's going to take. Then finally wait for the shell to pop. That's the hurdle of war, then put a bag in the microwave and hit the button. So she was deceived like this? ? ? even with me. That's why I think she's the most patient person in the world.
Patience is one of the many important things in life, if you are impatient we have to deal with it and then people will say you are impatient and need to calm down. Patience also means that you are a polite person, you don't complain about anything, and you understand and wait no matter what happens. Suppose someone is queuing up to buy food. You have to wait your turn to get your food while someone else is getting his/her food. This is a role model for someone who is understanding and polite and sometimes even littering children/children. You are setting an example and being considerate. This is why patience requires understanding and empathy for many reasons.
My brother and I have been wanting dogs for a while now and every month mom and dad say we want a dog @CAPS1 a fish every month. Mom will look for dogs on the Internet, Dad will look for dogs on the Internet, Dad will look for dogs in newspapers. Colin and I told them to feed him and go and give him water in my birthday month like @NUM1 days ago @NUM2 they said we're getting a dog! tomorrow! It was at night @NUM1:00 so we couldn't sleep because we were so happy! On the morning of @CAPS2 near @NUM4, we got in the car and mum said this place is in Howell so it can't be that far. Colin so happy we got to the house with @NUM5 fluffy puppies, a white @NUM6 black I told my mom I want to put @CAPS3 to tell me it depends on dad dad loving him so that means @CAPS4. We named her a different patient. It's well worth it for our patients.
A warrior named @PERSON1 waited patiently for his sword, he waited for an hour. He just sat silently while everyone yelled. He is very happy. All he can think of is his @CAPS1. He likes swords very much. He uses @NUM1 as a sword. So he patiently took his sword. Then he fights ninjas. He went after ninjas because they found a boy named @PERSON2. Then he turned them into dust. This sword is made with magic. Then the warrior and @PERSON2 went to school. Warriors are teachers and @PERSON2 are students.
The story of my patience is when my family and I went to Monster Jam. This is one of the most exciting things in my life. But the trip there is pretty much @NUM1! Then it took half an hour to find a place to park. Then at least @NUM2 minutes for my mom's friend to show up. Ended up queuing for an hour. Last but not less than @NUM3 minutes to find our seats! Thanks for listening to my report on Patience and Patience!
There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere and my mom said "@CAPS1 not tonight" because it was a school night. So I said "well, I know it's a school night", @CAPS2 at least I said it politely and faithfully! That's when I'm loyal to someone, this is when I stand up for someone, my best friend is having a fight with another girl, that's in person, and I go straight to my @CAPS3 friend's "enemy" "And said why didn't you come home and leave my friend alone, she talked back and we ended up ignoring her and she left and that's when my best friend came forward in a fight. "
When I had to go to the doctor. I thought I would be in front. By the time we got there, the line had exceeded @NUM1, and many more were coming. I have to get my shot. So we have to be patient. But my mom can't wait because there are a lot of people using it up front. So I fell asleep. She is still walking around. So when I woke up, five people had passed. She still couldn't be patient and still made me nervous walking around and then another @NUM2 passed and it was really slow. Then she finally calmed down. She was patient because they said they were going to kick her out. I've never seen her so patient, unbelievable.
I wait patiently while I'm on the sidelines and @NUM1 grade. I don't care if you cut right in front of me. Waited @NUM2 minutes longer than me and the line was still big. After @NUM3 minutes my patience meter went down and I finally got a sub. I waited @NUM4 minutes for a sub like waiting for a pizza. As soon as I got to the checkout center, there was no money in my account, so I was really pissed, pissed off like you didn't receive any money in a year.
Once I was patient my brother broke his arm. I had a great day playing on the playground at lunchtime. He said he was on the horizontal bar. His hands were sweaty and he slipped. Eric fell on his arm. He screamed. The ladies took him to the office and called my parents. Then my parents called my school and told them they were picking me up. They picked me up and then annoyed me. We drove to the hospital and they did X-rays. It took a long time. I sat there quietly for @NUM1 hours! My parents told me they thanked me for being so patient now. I was very patient at that time.
My own way of telling the story of patience is when there are @NUM1 people in front of a central spot. You have to be patient in the line because other people are ahead of you so you have to wait for your turn before the line because it's called cutting and if you do you will be kicked out of place and you don't want that Happens because, for example, you want something to eat and you wait in line for your turn so you don't get kicked out of the rides, you have to wait for your turn so you don't get the secret.
Once I was very patient with my grandpa fishing in the north and we sat outside all day and we had to go up and down Chanel at least @NUM1 times. Every time we got bitten, but we never caught any fish. We tried it for our daily use and it didn't work so well I decided to change it up a bit. I gave my grandpa the idea to turn the boat around and head to towda shigle bay. He agreed, but the only problem was there were a lot of rocks when we were going and the last thing we needed was for the props to snap. But we took our chances and relented, or we were I instructed him to go, and once we were in the bag, bang! We've seen the pale bends so far and it's hard to believe it's a fish so I got the net and my grandfather grabbed the pole and started to realize we ended up getting it to the surface, it's a @NUM2 inches of fence, we smiled and talked about what seemed like eating fish tonight, this is the story of my patient doing a fish test and then I caught the biggest fish in the lake!
"@CAPS1 on!" I said. We were in the waiting room at my father's doctor's office. My dad went to a special doctor. It's boring. There was also a potato sale so my sister and I went to @CAPS3 while my dad was reading. We are @CAPS3's most important doctor morning. We are there @CAPS2! That's the meal of my life. Doctors are slow and they are stupid. "I told my dad he was patient. These too??? Sold @CAPS3 and then the Doctor??? We want, @CAPS3 they have dishes, food, kosher and diaring rummy for sale. My trail I got? ?? Krispey treat. I also have a hol on the side. Her hat is cool. I have a ??? and me? Blue, purple, pink and dazzling. Finally they call my dad. My dad goes Went into a ward - when my dad @CAPS1 came out he said he was healthy. He had to wait until they got him ready in advance to go to the lake to fill up. They gave him his prescription and we left. Anyway , we should be patient with people. Patience is kindness. I always have patience with people. I want you to be patient with people.
Start of the day, @PERSON1 watching @CAPS1.V. As she was watching, an ad started playing and said the final film of a hugely popular series was coming out tomorrow night. The next day at school, everyone was very excited. They couldn't wait to see a movie that night. It's finally time to buy tickets. When @PERSON1 got there, a huge line had already formed. @PERSON1 was waiting, then she realized her best friend @PERSON2 was right in front of her. Then the rich and popular girl showed up with her lime. Her name is @CAPS2. She walked to the ticket booth and asked everyone to line up. She tried to pay extra for better seats because she kept people in line. The conductor said she just had to line up like everyone else. This annoyed @CAPS2 because she got there without '@CAPS1 queuing up, so there were more people in line. But @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 keep talking. Since they were patient, the time passed quickly and the next thing they knew they were buying tickets. But @CAPS2 thinks it will take her a long time to get tickets because she has no patience.
I am patient when I go to Cedar Point. I have to wait in line? ? ? For priencse, many people @CAPS1 is the longest word? ? ? drost. I have almost an hour to go to @NUM1, teens? That is? ? ? .
One day my family and I all went to @CAPS1 point. I am so excited. When we arrived, I rushed out of the car. We got our tickets and a map and we decided where we wanted to go. We're going to @CAPS2 Dragon and there's such a long queue. It feels like it doesn't even move. I am as patient as possible. I'm so excited to try this ride, the family is finally moving up! ! ! ! We are next. We all sat in our seats and made sure we were tucked nicely behind. The roller coaster takes about a few minutes and is worth the wait. That's the time to be patient.
A @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 creem store frasty's I'm locked in this thread is huge. There must be more than @NUM1 people in @CAPS2 and I'm in @CAPS3 waiting in line. Think about what I will get. @CAPS4 One order after another. Until a short old lady hadn't decided what she was going to buy, I sat down and waited for her to yell, if it was sugar free, what ingredients would it have on it, @CAPS5, @CAPS5, @CAPS5. Finally she ordered. I was at the front of the line when suddenly a group of people came up. I guess @CAPS4 is "waiting in line" . The @CAPS2 @NUM2 of them had to shout out to the guys at @CAPS8, the glass terrible is a roach ship about to sail away. Finally the order is done and I'm up @CAPS9 @CAPS10 I can speak to this lovely old lady asking "Can I chop a deer in front of you?" I have to say yes, @CAPS2 is not good if I don't . This is my story about patience.
My brother Matt has never been the patient type. Whenever something or someone takes too long, he always gets really frustrated. We always had to be patient with Matt, but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, Matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were waiting in line there, I made a bet with Matt's girlfriend. Bet she'll owe me two dollars apiece no matter how many impatient comments he makes. If he doesn't say any impatient comments, I owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our order and left, we all started talking. The adults talk about work and stuff, and I talk about school and stuff with @PERSON1, my nephew. This took at least a few minutes. For the lost few minutes, we watched the football game in action. I didn't hear a single impatient comment from Matt for those few minutes, including the minutes we were talking. I am really touched. I'm so upset I owe Matt's girlfriend two dollars.
Once, when I had patience, I went hunting with my mom. You have to have a lot of patience to do this. When my mom and I were sitting in the deer blind spot, she was preparing a crossbow in case the deer came. But we sat there for about @NUM1 hours. I was about to lose my patient, but then some deer came in, a doe and her calf. My mom didn't want to shoot the mother or the fawn because then the fawn would be alone. So we waited for more deer to come in, but none. But I still have patience with me. When it started to get cold and dark outside, we thought no more deer would come in, so we went home and my mom was starting to get a little impatient. But that's when I waited patiently for a while.
When I think of patience, I usually think of my mom and how tolerant and understanding she was. Even though she has explained something to me about @NUM1 times, I still don't get it, she will help me without complaint. A good example is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. @CAPS1 is @DATE1 time and I am about five years old. My dad was at work and mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad told me you need to turn the handlebars before crashing, but I keep forgetting and falling. It wasn't easy to get frustrated with @CAPS1, I gave up a little later. Now, though, my mom has gently persuaded me to try again. She grabbed the bike and made me pedal. She released her hand and shouted, "Turn! Turn!" But @CAPS1 didn't work. I took a wrong turn and fell on the grass. "@CAPS1 no problem. You almost have @CAPS1!" Mom said to me. I put on a brave face and tried again. I try to ride a bike over and over again. Never once was angry with me, my mother helped me up. I tried it one last time before @CAPS1 it's time to go home, my mom let it go, I rode alone and came back around the corner! When I came back, we all had a little dance, Mom congratulated me, and we called Dad to brag about my new achievement. For me, my mom showed patience that day. She didn't let me give up, she never complained. Overall, my mom is the perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!
You have to try to be patient with your homework. Once, when I was doing my homework, I started to get impatient. Because I'm in trouble. But then my dad said he would help me @CAPS1 and he told me to be patient. @CAPS1 I'm sitting there sitting. And being as patient as possible, then he helped me very well. I usually get impatient when it comes to homework or something like that. You @CAPS2 need to do your best to be patient.
Everyone has had patience at one time or another. I know I have. One year my brother and I had a project to do. We all need a computer to do it. I let my brother go first. I had to wait because there was only one computer at home. After a few hours, I checked to see if my brother was nearly done. He wasn't, but I remember him typing slowly. The next day he was done. In has no problem with this as I have a lot of time to type. This is my time to be patient.
The one time I had the patience was when going camping. I had to wait @NUM1 hours until we got to camp. I slept and eat most of the time and we also watched movies on the @PERSON1 @CAPS1 player. We finally got their stuff, but I had to wait a little longer to register and I had to wait until the rain stopped so I could put my stuff in our cabin. Next we wait for the church to start, but there's more to do there, like tennis, volleyball, or sitting in the lunch room chatting with friends, or reading in your cabin one last time. When the bell rang, we all entered the show center and waited for the church to end. We have a lot of patients by the weekend. Oh we had to wait a few seconds for lunch as their food was so good. In the end, I had to wait @NUM1 hours on my way home. This is when I have patience. (a whole bunch).
One day, an alien race appeared on Earth. They are called "@CAPS1". They want these balls called @ORGANIZATION2 and it will summon a @ORGANIZATION2 that will fulfill your wishes. @NUM1 strong fighters, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 had to stop them. But they are too powerful. @ORGANIZATION1 is dead and then training with king @CAPS3, but everyone else is waiting for @ORGANIZATION1. At last he came and knocked out their leftovers. Earth is saved.
The day after school, I was told I had a doctor's appointment, so I said when my mom said @NUM1, I had a prom after school that started at @NUM2, so I said @CAPS1 I had a dacen of @NUM2, She said woo woo woo woo woo woo! At least that's why I herd @CAPS1. "@CAPS1 mom this is my first dance" I said angrily @CAPS1 she let me in the car so we waited in the waiting room for an hour I was ready to miss the dance @CAPS1 I was quiet they we ended up in In the office, coming home ready to dance and having a good time.
Patience You should be patient with anything. If you're impatient here, something can happen, once my sister friend wants to cross the road and she doesn't want to wait, so she doesn't look either way, a car comes and she runs out from the front of it and gets caught Car crashed. She had cuts and burns all over her body and she was taken to the hospital where I went with my sister and mom to see her the day she went to the hospital. She was cut all over and couldn't really walk. She had so many wounds that someone had to help her walk, so it could have been a mouth after she was shot and she went to the doctor because her head movement had been so bad. They said she had something called a coma, like she was kind of in a coma. So that's what happens when you don't even have the patience for something, like crossing the street, you have to be patient to do it. But if you're patient, like this story, my mom once told me to wait in the car, open the windows, and turn on the air. So I did and I was really bored and I was about to get out of the car but then I saw someone trying to open the window. So I put my phone on, went to the back, sat on the Grond, and called @NUM1. They are on the road, they are on the road. Now they got out of the car and ran to those guys to catch them and they quickly found out that the @NUM2 guys were the ones they were looking for, so I got a sum of money to catch them. Realized the money was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience for not getting out of the car gave me money. Saved my life because they would kill me if they saw me, and helped find the bad guys. So patience saves lives and helps find bad guys you never know what you get out of patience, that's my story about having patience and what they can get you. Therefore, you should always be patient.
One person I know is very patient when I interact with them. That person is waiting for a phone call or email that promises to happen. The call or email is about a basketball team that is very dominant in the state. The guy I called or emailed with was the coach of that team. He saw the guy I was with, my brother, playing a tournament down state in @LOCATION1. The coach is there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's games and went to him after the game. They talked about the team and he told him he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him, so he gave the coach our phone number and his email address. The coach said he will contact him in @NUM1 days at most. My brother has been checking his email on our drive home because it took us @NUM1 days to get home. @CAPS2 Coach never called or emailed him that day. Still not the next day. My brother was very patient with it coming and he was never stressed that it wasn't coming. On our third day home, my brother was very understanding when my mother told him it might not happen. So we got home at @NUM3 and I started to wonder if my brother was the team. Then the phone rang. My brother hung up after chatting for a while, saying that he had formed a team. That was the one time my brother was patient.
A wise man once said that patience is a virtue. Let's see if that wise man is right. I'm going back @DATE1 year. I just talked to my parents about what I said. "@CAPS1, I called you this LEGO @CAPS2?" "@CAPS3", @CAPS5 said and @CAPS5 made me move. I kindly got her out of the way and @CAPS5 ordered it. When I asked her "@CAPS1 did you know my LEGO was coming?" it was @DATE1 @CAPS5 who said "it should be before or after @CAPS2." I replied with @CAPS7.K. It was a week before @CAPS2 and I spoofed the mail. "No packages" I thought to myself. So I didn't check the porch for anything. @CAPS2 A week later, the postman came. on one package that I can see. It turns out that the wise are right, and patience is a virtue. This is my time to be patient. I also learned to wait for something better.
One day, my parents checked the holidays online. They are on vacation at @LOCATION1 outside of Traverse City. We decided to go @NUM1 days and it will start next month and I'm excited to go but I'm still patient enough to wait until people call us to tell us we can go (look forward to our booking) @LOCATION1 . When this day When it finally arrived, I was really excited. We had everything packed and ready to go, even the dogs. After putting the dog in, we started walking. We had to send the dogs to my grandmother because they had nothing else to go to, so we threw them away and started heading to @LOCATION1, and it was a four hour drive away. When we were driving for about an hour, my sister got really impatient and kept asking if we were there, but I just sat there looking out the window. Then we got to a pit stop and when did we get water and drinks. My mom and dad wanted coffee so wanted some coffee but it didn't work so we had to be there for @NUM2 minutes and they finally had coffee and mironda and I sat there the whole time. Then we've been patiently heading to @LOCATION1.
Can you @CAPS1 when you have to wait a long time for something? I had to wait a long time. Do you think you know what that is? " It was the eve of @CAPS2. I was only five at the time. So I couldn't wait for tomorrow when I woke up at @CAPS2. I tell myself that all day. I went out and tried to waste some time, but it didn't help because It was cold outside. So had to go back in right away. I had nothing to do. So I waited and then "@CAPS4" my brother got up and I played with him all day until we had to sleep. Then it was time to go to bed, I ran straight to my bedroom, went straight to bed, woke up the next morning and I was so happy I didn't have to wait. I had to wait that day I was happy but know @CAPS5 13, I Really don't care anymore, but I'd still love to hear your footsteps.
I'm at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride I really want to go, and I'm in a long line! It's like a big-line ruler. I don't like long queues. Like most kids, I don't make a fuss about waiting. In my head, I was thinking about when I should hit the road. I don't scream and shout, I just try to stand and wait. The second continues. Tic Tac Toe Tic Tac Toe. Just wait for the lines to get shorter. After a few minutes, it was finally my turn to ride the roller coaster and I was so excited! I went for a ride and it was great! The only problem is, only one minute! The line I had to wait was like an hour. Not bad. That line is worth it.
On @DATE1, both my friends and I laughed, but then I remembered that I had to have dinner in @NUM1 minutes. So I walked in and my friends were very patient. They didn't leave me, so I drove as fast as I could, so I didn't keep them waiting. When we were done, we went back to the park and had a swing on the swings. Then we walked back to my house because they had to leave to go home. That's my @DATE1. This is an interesting one.
@CAPS4 @CAPS1 lives in Ohio. He goes to @CAPS2 middle school and when he walks home after school @CAPS3 his friend asks him to wait for him in the parking lot so he can call his mother and ask @CAPS4 if he can spend the weekend at his house. @ CAPS4 had to wait a full half hour while @CAPS3 talked and argued with his mother. But thanks to @CAPS4 for their patience after @CAPS3 wrapped up the conversation, they all spent the weekend at @CAPS8's house.
There was one time when I was nervous and that was when I wanted an I-pod tuch. My grandmother is bidding on an I-pod touch. It took us a long time to get it, but we won. It took them a long time to ship, but we got it. In the end, it all paid off.
If you were the person sitting next to me on the bus to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you're my best friend and it's the day before you take me to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1, that's another story. But I'll still tell you. My best friend @PERSON1 and I talked on the phone for at least an hour a day for about two weeks. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me. If I want to go to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, soon, I plan to spend @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 on @CAPS3. The next few days were boring, just sitting at home and taking care of my brothers. @DATE3 @TIME1 seems like a thousand years have passed. @PERSON1 called to say I might not get through @TIME2, but we still plan to go to @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay, but I was still frustrated. Here comes @DATE2, it's total torture. I babysit my brothers, but nothing keeps any of us busy. We tried running around the house a few times, but it only took about ten minutes. Then we decided it was time to watch a movie. We spent at least two hours of idle time watching @CAPS5. We had lunch and after that, things moved very fast to make up for how slow it used to be. I chatted with kenzie for at least two hours before my parents got home and it was business as usual. Next is bedtime. I tossed and turned on the sheets but couldn't sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 and just told me she was eating a pizza, which didn't help at all. In the end, I fell into the abyss of need. Early the next morning, I got dressed, packed, and was ready to go. Here comes Kenzie, her mom and her brothers and we finally have a sweet @DATE4 at @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1. The drive there seems to be five minutes, but that's a good thing. We've been there! We had a lot of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 dessert. I'm both patient and impatient with parts of it. Now you know for me, if I'm impatient, but if it's smaller, I can wait.
When I was at school, I was patient when my teacher left the room. The kids started going crazy and they were standing on the table. Throwing paper @ORGANIZATION1 planes and paper in @ORGANIZATION1. The kids were screaming and I just sat there watching the teacher come in to see what was going on. I just sat there and I was amazed how stupid their actions were. Then I watched them get into trouble and get a call home. I'm thinking I'm glad I wasn't involved because I might get kicked out of the cross country team. The kids are taking a break for lunch. I hope this never happens to me again because I'm just an eyewitness to them getting the kids into even more trouble.
When my father took me hunting last year, I was very patient. It all started when we woke up in the morning at @NUM1, we got dressed, left to go in, the deer was blind. We heard a lot of gunfire as soon as we got there. From shotguns, rifles and even black powder. We waited all day until it got dark again, then we packed up and left. My dad and I didn't see anything all day. This is a story about how patient I am.
One day I was going hunting and I waited patiently for Dad to get dressed. When he finally did, we headed to the woods. After that, we went blind and waited patiently for fifty minutes. Just then, a deer came in. It's a perfect doe. Finally, the deer showed up in front of the blind man at @NUM1 or @CAPS1 and my dad whispered "wait for it to turn to the side." @CAPS1 I waited until it turned and shot the doe. In the end we went out and found my arrows but no deer and I'll have to wait patiently for next year's hunt.
One time I wanted this awesome @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and it looked great so I asked my mom and she said we have it tomorrow so I waited and waited. I'm very patient, but I'm starting to get a little fidgety because it's taking so long. I'm a little impatient, and while I'm not complaining, I still hope @CAPS3 until today I just have to be patient.
Brother @CAPS1 is patient, brother @CAPS1 understands tolerance. He understood tolerance by contemplating waiting. He was waiting at the doctor for medicine. I was very patient in crying with him. We are always patient when we have to wait for something, another time I am patient is when I always get a @CAPS1 haircut or hairline. I had to wait a long time to cut @CAPS1's hair. Those were some times when I had to be patient.
I had a doctor appointment one day and I had to check at my desk and when I was done I had to sit and wait patiently for the doctor to call me back to get me done and I waited until the real doctor came to see how I was feeling and to see what I was eating Was it good or not and then I had to go to the checkout to see what my next check was and then I had to refill and then I went home.
I was calm once when my mom said she would buy me a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 I waited and waited and waited for her but I knew I had to stay calm because she was going through a tough time.
These stories are about when I was patient. This is a story so once my guardian put away my winter clothes on this @DATE1 I told her about these my good clothes and I was like no real winter clothes she said she knew, she said I just put them away well because she said i have a lot of clothes in the same color and i tried to talk back and then i was like o i understand what you're talking about because i can't fit everything in my dresser so i patiently helped She sorted my clothes. Patience means that you can do what others ask you to do, or that you can do the right thing to others. Or, can you help them when you think they are helpful with something?
Once upon a time, I was seeing a doctor and it was very high-sounding. Great my mom went and told the boy about me I was sitting next to this lady and when my mom came back her daughter was crying and the doctor was calling her name I tried to be patient so I got up and went to the kids play area and start playing. After a few minutes the doctor finally called my name so we got there at @NUM1 and the doctor called me at @NUM2 pm. So they gave me a chance to sit in the room for @NUM3 minutes, they gave me some modifiers, told me to go get the cheese, and if there was a problem for me to go to the @CAPS1/pharmacy, that's when I was patient.
When I was waiting for my own call, I was waiting, so I texted my friends and called them and so on. I'm also waiting to get my own snowmobile license so I can ride my own snowmobile. Know what, you always have to be patient.
Playing hockey is very important to me. I am a goalkeeper for farmington hills. Playing the ball requires "cheeky" skills and above all patience. Every game day @CAPS2 Dad would tell me to "Calm, Calm and Collect" three @CAPS1 (that's what I call it). I'm on the ice, patiently waiting for the puck to come to @CAPS2 way. Once it's done, I'll move on. The pirod is over, I'll be patient. The second pirod where I stood waiting for the puck to drop hoping we were scared. @CAPS3! ! ! @CAPS3! ! ! @NUM1 to @NUM2 @CAPS2 Patience to help it is @NUM1 to @NUM2! Third pirod to @CAPS3! ! Big @CAPS4 from @ORGANIZATION1 (that's me)! @CAPS3! ! Woohoo! ! @NUM5 to @NUM2. The game is over! I'm patiently waiting for @LOCATION1 to win. After the game, we all went to @CAPS5 @CAPS6's house party to celebrate a big win. We all had a great time too.
This is a story about my patience at the airport waiting for the plains. We are on our way to @LOCATION1 and we had to walk two plains to get there. When we left Plains for the second airport, we went to see when our second flight was coming in. We were shocked when we found out the timing of the second flight as we had to wait six hours to get in. My mom told me I have to be patient, but I'm not good at patience. To get rid of my thoughts, we decided to eat. when i finish eating. I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. It's only been three hours that annoys me. So I started playing with my ds. Before I know it, we only have an hour left, so playing with my ds is a distraction. I quickly became impatient and my sister and I started messing around. Suddenly our plains arrived and I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient, she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learned to be patient.
Sometimes I have to be patient. This time I went to the dentist and we sat down. Let me tell you something I hate about dentists. So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But the only good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst places to go are dentists and doctors. One thing about the doctor is that you don't have to wait long. This means you can get and leave. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview. A good thing Patience can get you to good places. Patience is a polite way. So if all your preparations are expected to be patient. Not being patient is just disrespectful. It's like dealing with dirt or something. Patience is a bit like table manners, friendly and professional. If I were you, patiently waiting for it will lead you to a better future.
Patience is important, and without it, everyone will be irritated all the time. Without patience, we won't be able to get through the day, we'll be constantly looking at the clock and thinking about when I'm out. Some people are impatient, some are patient. This can affect the smallest things that everyone is impatient with each other's behaviors, because we have to wait in line at the store, or have to count the money. It can change the way of life of every person on earth Patience is one of the most important things on earth. Patience helps us make the right choice. Rather than being asked a question and you answer right away, wait and make a better decision. As much as many of us think, in terms of patience, I can summarize that now is more than just waiting for it to accept what you don't like. It also throws away life without saying why I can't do something, or you can't do something because I can't. Without patience, the world would not be what it is now.
Patience, something you must have when you want to be friends with someone. The story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just doesn't have the patience. I was walking into the speech contest room. I was sitting next to all my friends and everyone thought I was going to finish first. When I went with a friend of mine, he said he just sprayed a little cologne because he was really nervous and he didn't know what he was doing. @CAPS2 actually knew he and I were friends. When I went up to see what number I was, I found that I was the first to speak. My friend said I would do good things and he was right behind me. I was quick to start talking about @PERSON1 @CAPS1 Ladies love my talk! After our friend @ORGANIZATION1 and I finished our presentation, we all sat next to each other and chatted a lot. Then all our friends asked if we were friends? I said, "@CAPS2 why should I be friends with him?" and @CAPS1 laughed. We both looked at each other with bad eyes. We won't be talking to each other for a few days because @CAPS1 is very suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But of course, @ORGANIZATION1 is impatient. He'd love to tell @CAPS1 that he and I are friends but we can't tell anyone because it's all different to them but the truth is we're all exactly the same because we both love football, basketball, music and like @NUM1 Talk the same. Ha ha! Soon @CAPS1 found out. @ORGANIZATION1 told @CAPS1 that we are friends. Turns out @CAPS2 someone laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ORGANIZATION1 had the patience of @CAPS2 and finally told them we were friends. Now me and @ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will always be best friends! In conclusion, @CAPS3 It's good to have patience, but sometimes people don't have patience when they want to be friends.
When I had the patience it was me and my cousin's family who went to @LOCATION1 and my sister was sick. I was sitting in my car with my other sister. About two and a half hours. My sister got mad, but I just sat there patiently. My mom and sister spent the longest time in the doctor's office! My sister ended up making three trips to the doctor's office. But I'm patient and when she's not at the doctor, she just wants to lie down, so we can barely do anything fun. By the end of the trip, she was feeling better, so my mom took us to do something fun. That's when I have patience.
Be patient and wait for your turn to line up, @CAPS3 jumping in line you should wait because jumping in line is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS1 disrespect. You will have no friends. Patience is respect for others, and others will become your friends. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 Respect for not waiting for your turn. @CAPS1 When you do something and your mom and dad are talking to another adult, @CAPS1 rushes when other people don't want to do something with you. Or nagging about leaving a place like an aunt or uncle's house. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 When you don't wait. Respect and wait This is a better way to make friends. If someone @CAPS3 respects you, please let them know. Then walk away and say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to @CAPS3 wait and be patient. Ok.
I felt a shiver in my body. We are @NUM1 seconds until @ORGANIZATION1 kicks off. I had to wait @NUM2 minutes to climb Space Mountain. I wish I could get everyone in line, but I know I have to wait. When I got out of the car, I knew it was well worth it. At the end of the day, I begged for another ride. Again I had to wait @NUM3 minutes to continue. This ride shows @CAPS1's boring history. In the end it gave us a screen where we chose the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it.
Have you ever taken care of children? If you have, then you know how much patience it takes. It was my little cousin's third birthday party, and as the eldest, it was my responsibility to take care of the younger ones. At first, everything went well. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen and giving me fake food. Then one of them started playing with a bat. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the other children will immediately stop what they are doing and play with the toy. So all the kids surrounded the pepper balls, giggling happily when the machine saw the plastic balls flying into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and grabbed a ball from the air, causing other children to scramble for the ball and scream. I told them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized it took a lot of patience. I calmly took the bat away and waited for them to settle down. Thank goodness my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play Ball Chili in peace. I learned an important lesson from my cousin's birthday party - babysitting takes a lot of patience!
"@CAPS1!!" I have another math homework tomorrow and I'm tired of math. Every day my 4th grade teacher gave us very long and difficult math homework. Some days I go home and cry because it's really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it didn't work for me. Every day I come home and sit at the table, take my time, and do things. @NUM1 questions are hard for 4th graders. Whenever math starts, I pull out my homework and wait for it to be checked. I've never done anything terrible. @CAPS2 I have always been proud of my work. But when I get homework, I'm never happy. Taking a new class every day is also challenging. I have to be patient and take it slow. I have to be patient and take it slow. One day my teacher gave us a simple lesson and I believe I can do it in school. Every once in a while I have a problem and I get stressed out. But I remember what my mom said, "Be patient and stay calm," @CAPS2 I did. I was patient and I solved the problem. To this day, I remember being patient. I also remember that we will have to be patient throughout our lives. Math has helped me become a more patient person from the inside out.
This time, my brother and I are back from @LOCATION1. All was well until the car broke down on the free road. So we called our parents to pick us up. Well, when they got there, they forgot about the carriage. So just as they approached us, they left. So @NUM1 hours passed and heard they're coming. I say you remember to get everything. They shook their heads and, yes, took the car down the road with us.
One time @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was sitting there having a good time watching TV and his brother or stepbrother @PERSON1 came into the room and said "@CAPS2 we have to go to the interview or you're going to be grounded, ??" @CAPS3 was long, ” @CAPS2 said, “About an hour,” @PERSON1 replied. But the itch and itch will keep going, and only once,” @CAPS2 said, “@CAPS6 That pointless kids show, man, on @CAPS7 , and then they turned into real shows." is it? "@CAPS2 said. It's in @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS6 and @CAPS9 @CAPS10 people @CAPS2 was there and we left in an hour, ok, so do a science experiment or something," @PERSON1 said, @CAPS2 never likes @CAPS9 - @CAPS13 man, after the ad he was on @DATE1, I won't say what happened. @CAPS2 did what he did best and did a science experiment to get revenge on @CAPS9-@CAPS13 men or people he didn't like. So he waited @NUM1 minutes for the experiment to complete. Then they left, it was a three-hour drive, his favorite show was on, and he recorded it. He was patient and they got there. He had @NUM2 mins with @CAPS9-@CAPS10 people, could @PERSON1 be lying to him, he was so patient that he was tired and fell asleep and woke up guessing who. " @CAPS9-@CAPS10 folks, remember me" @CAPS2 said @CAPS9-@CAPS10 dude, @PERSON1 looked and laughed, @CAPS2 threw a candy ball at @CAPS9-@CAPS10, @DATE2, @DATE2, No more @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. @CAPS2 is patient, he waited patiently for over @NUM3 hours to see the itch, almost @DATE2 @DATE1 back @CAPS9-@CAPS10 people. Finish.
Usually I have very little patience (yes, I do know patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago I had to live with any dad in a hospitable room with mom, @CAPS1 very Bored, but somehow I managed to not cry all day.
When you have patience. I go shopping at school. There may be over a hundred people in the @PERSON1 store. It's like a duster in the sand. You can barely go on. ores. It's like a whole mall in one small store. Some will leave because of how many people are there. And then there will be more. It's me, @CAPS1 mom and @CAPS1 dad. We got to work. We may be behind @NUM1 people or more. @CAPS1 Mom is ready to explode. So @TIME1 only @TIME1 people left. @CAPS1 Mom almost fell asleep and I just stood there waiting. But the @CAPS1 army was wounded and @CAPS1 was driven back. She was ready to leave that store. @CAPS1 Dad was reading a magazine while he was waiting. Espn News to be exact. These are just the ones used by the first few people. I'm so glad we can finally buy @CAPS1 clothes. Get up with @CAPS1 clothes, checkout brakes. The lady said it would take an hour or two, so @CAPS1 mom started complaining. We queued for an hour and a half to make this happen. "@CAPS1 dad is so good about it because he loves that magizene so much I can't believe this happened I'm so disappointed I'm ready @CAPS1 mom so mom so we got @CAPS1 dad and left. @CAPS1 Dad said, "I did a great job. "I didn't get the clothes that day, but we went to the new week to get them.
I was patient when we were on the bus, we just got to school and the kids were noisy during the day. Getting off a lot when someone jumps in front? ? ? Then I went back to my seat and it was about @NUM1 - @DATE1 the kids got off. So I waited for all the kids to pass me and then I got up and walked to the door and the bus driver said "thank you for waiting". then i left
That's @DATE1, @CAPS1, my friends talking about how cool the Xbox is. They're saying, if you get Xbox Live, how are you going to play with people all over the world. They are also talking about new upcoming games called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I have searched online. It was voted for a ranking of @NUM2 stars. Now it's a good game. I had asked my mom and dad if I could get it. They both always said they would see it. Another month later, I asked my mom again and she said why didn't you wait until @CAPS6. Once I went to my dad's house and he said @CAPS6 is just around the corner. But I say everyone has it can't I get it right now. My dad said no, so I waited @NUM1 months after that, wondering if he could get an answer, or if he changed it. Again he said no. So I went to my mother's house to ask her, she said I should be able to wait, and she also said that if I ask again, I won't get it. So here comes @CAPS6, as a last gift from my mom and dad, I got an Xbox with my favorite game and I'm super happy. And know I know if you're patient and you wait long enough you'll get what you want.
I am always patient. But do you know when I'm really patient? This is when I cut my hair. Every time I go for a haircut, there are a lot of people in the @CAPS1 store. So one day people said they had to go to some party or church and needed a haircut there. So I let them cut and I have to wait and be patient. It's nice to have patience because I'm helping others, and if I need someone to be very patient with me, then I want them to be patient.
This is about when I got my patent, first I was baby sitting on my cozin. The names were @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 and they had to put their hats on because they were rearranging things upstairs so we were sitting downstairs. Nexzeke @PERSON1 and I watched a movie. I was called tices two and they didn't sit down, but in order to sit down and watch the movie, it took them a lot of time without yelling at them. That was the beginning and I wanted to play with @CAPS1 in the crib. Finally, they were almost done upstairs. The sofa and chire were moved. So there's more space upstairs, and that's when I can.
I am patient when I go to ceder point @CAPS1, I use it to play video games. When I was packing, I grabbed my psp and I put it in my bag. So I'm half bored? ? ? there so i grabbed my psp and ? ? ? So I forgot???. Because we??? My girl did, we? ? ? Entering the hotel, we are close to the park, but as soon as I get there? ? ? Long my patience. We line up and we sit with them forever, so I play with my psp. psp help me to be patient. A generation? ? ? my psp to help. It's going to be hard, but my psp test my thoughts? ? ?
Patience is usually good or bad for me. Here are a few reasons why patience can be difficult or stressful. If you are waiting for a shooting or life threatening result. One way to avoid normal patience like a boardroom is to take some notes or schoolwork or an ipod. Patience is everywhere. Such as carrides, birthday parties, holiday ads, school dismissal, restaurants, vacations or whenever you say "I can't wait", etc. Summarize some of the ways to be patient in the way I describe it.
The time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my brother at the dentist. My brother's name is @CAPS1 and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother had to have his wisdom teeth removed. My grandma and @CAPS2 waited for hours. After a while, she went to the back room with my brother. So I sat alone in the waiting room. Thank goodness I have my @CAPS3 so I watched some cartoons and listened to music. After a few minutes, I went to the bathroom. When I got out of the car, a nurse asked me to go with her and she took me to the back room with my brother and grandma. I just found out that the doctor hasn't started yet! At least I can talk to my brother. So over the course of a few days, the doctor finally showed up. After an hour or so, the operation was over. Then we had to sit back and wait for the amnesia to go away. My brother acted crazy and crazy. It's actually fun. Finally we left and I didn't lose my patience.
I don't let my pcar and mom cook me some lazuge when I'm really patient. My passing is @DATE1 and I don't feel anything. On my first birthday, my mom made my @CAPS1 cook for @CAPS2. It was all over when she cooked something for my first birthday party. My @CAPS3 mom made a @NUM1 plate of it. So good, when I said soon I meant soon, she took it out and it disappeared. I became @NUM2 years old. My mom made a big deal for my birthday party. My mom died of open heart Sergey. She was @NUM3 at the time. She has alto friends in her stove. The stove is very good. But back to what I wrote, so on @DATE2 I asked my @CAPS1. Cook me some. She told me that this is very important to me. I said @CAPS1 you want me to give you some money to cook for me. She said no, save your little money. I said but @CAPS1 can take my money and buy my lazangae and cook for me. She said girl what I said. So I quickly put the money in my pocket. Then I keep moving. When we get in the truck she now says @CAPS5 I'm going to cook it so I can get some, more, money, and when I pay the bills. On @DATE3, she made me some. The day she cooked for me was @CAPS6 @NUM4, @DATE3. I have some for my antyes, some for my siblings, some for my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8. When none of them are willing, I stand there watching them get some and when to stop getting some. Selfer when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8 get some. I didn't tell them when it was anoft because I lived in their house. My siblings live with them. lanag only lasted @NUM5 days, and it. I am happy when she cooks. I take it to school for lunch.
The one time I had the patience was at the end of my senior year when I had just signed up for a football game. I make @DATE1 wait from @DATE1. I was so excited about football when I got my football mat, I wore it about four times before the football started. @DATE1 has passed, it's @DATE2. In @DATE2, I showed cows, so @DATE2 compresses very fast. Finally @DATE1. I only made @DATE1 wait eleven days until my first practice day. When the day came, it went by very fast, 6 o'clock in the afternoon arrived quickly. Then the time for @DATE1. I loved football that year and I've been playing football ever since. @DATE1 Waiting for the football takes patience. Two months @MONTH1 doesn't seem like that long, but for a ten year old, @DATE1 is hard to wait that long.
The time I had to be patient was when my brother was going to make me a present and I didn't even have a birthday yet. This is where the whole story begins. It's been a hot @DATE1 day and I've been doing my chores including racking, mowing and more yard work. Mom and Dad and my brother Travis have been talking a lot. When I was just sitting on the stairs they would tell me to do my chores and then I could see them talking. I can't hear what they're saying, which bothers me. I finally got back to my chores and I just finished mowing the lawn witch took two hours and I went in and started watching TV and all of a sudden I heard "click, click" and then suddenly I heard my brother yelling Travis said "Hey, come back here", I walked up to our fourteen curved stairs, and all of a sudden I was being licked by a six-month-old puppy, I smiled and grabbed his collar and saw His name is Max, and he's a three-year-old happy fool now, and that's what my brothers showed me to get it all. Being and doing a lot of work around the house. I love my dog, but that's when I have to be patient
At one point I was waiting for the game and I didn't have it yet. So I asked my mom if she could buy me a new game and how much? @NUM1$ then she said you have to wait a few days @NUM2 passed then I finally asked my mom if she could buy it for me she said ok. I say thank you. Then the next morning we went to the game store and I saw the game I wanted and I told my mom we went to the counter and bought my game.
Doctor appointment. Oct @NUM1 @DATE1 My mom and I are getting ready to go to the doctor. Once we got them it was very crowded. I feel like we've been theirs for weeks, even @CAPS1 they're a lot of kids crying and playing. I'm so tired, I'm still waiting for my turn to see the doctor @NUM2 minutes and still not my turn, I'm trying to be patient but all the noise of the kids running around doesn't help tell me? ? ? ? . I walked to the register where I found the appointment I wanted until @NUM3 o'clock and only @NUM4.
One day my dad and I had a doctor's appointment at @NUM1 pm so we went there on time. Then I sat with my dad for a while. We think it will take a few more minutes. So we waited @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went to ask other doctors how long it would take. The doctor said to wait another @NUM2 minutes, so we waited another @NUM2 minutes. The doctor still hasn't come out. We waited @NUM5 minutes. My dad went to the doctor again. They said we waited a few more minutes and the doctor called us. So the doctor is @NUM7 minutes late. When we entered the room, the doctor said sorry! because he was late. That's my patience with my father.
Being patient is a tough task. One day my mom and I were at @LOCATION1 looking for a pawn shop. We were stopped at almost every red light there. No one complained even though we got to a certain red light. Just before the lights turned green, very old lady with a walker came up to us and we waited @NUM1 minutes for the old lady to pass. Still no one complained.
What comes to your mind when you hear the word patience. When there are @NUM1 people standing in front of you, I think of a person in line at the store. In grade @NUM2 my sister and I played a game of patience. It's about who can walk the longest without food, all you can drink is water, and the winner gets a whole box of Dunkin' Donuts. I have about @NUM4 bottles of water on the @NUM3 day, but my sister is still there. On the @NUM5 day I drank about @NUM6 bottles of water and all day my tummy groaned with my sister. Day @NUM7 all my sister's moaning and ranting is gone, so? ? ? Are you? ? ? They and I drink water. Day @NUM8 I ate so much food that my entire font disappeared and my sister @CAPS1 was cheering and she said "don't worry, let you eat my @NUM9 chocolate donuts" and she kept her word. In my opinion, this is patience.
One of the worst feelings in the world is that your flight has been cancelled. This happens to a lot of people, but my family has only one family. My cousins are coming to @LOCATION1 for Christmas. Cara and I text and email each other in @LOCATION1 to let us know where we're going. They've been planning this since @DATE1, but now their night is over! Where are we crazy! My cousins family had to be so patient because they didn't know if they would come to see us. My grandma keeps calling my uncle @LOCATION2. My grandma had a great idea for them! Move on to the next fight. The only problem is that the next flight is at @NUM1 and they take two hours to get here. I was waiting at the airport when they got here. When I saw my cousin she said "everyone is patient except me!" I expected the exact opposite, but, no! I thought my cousin Kahn would be a patient man, but I was wrong, but at least someone is patient.
When I'm patient it's my dad and I going to leslie, going hunting, we wake up @TIME1 @TIME3 and get there @TIME1 @TIME4. We stayed there until @TIME1 then we left. My dad shot a doe at the market while we were there @TIME1 @NUM1. He shorted another @TIME1 on @NUM2 in @TIME2 so we left two big ones in the back of my dad's truck. I was very patient during that time.
I was patient when I went to the dentist once. I had to be patient when I went to the dentist because when we got them we had a check up and there were a lot of people there so we had to wait a long time. While I was waiting, I was sitting on the ground, literally boarding. I kept asking my mom if it was my turn soon and she kept saying she didn't know. Finally the doctor called my name. So I went in and then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor and then when she was done I had to wait for my dentist to come in because he was working with another patient but then he finally came, Then I'm done! That's when I have to be very patient.
Patience Someone has patience with me when I don't understand something. Someone is a teacher. The teacher didn't complain to help me. with the students in the room. When the teachers helped me, they sat there quietly doing their homework. The teacher understands that I don't understand @CAPS1 to do the job. That was in math class. We are tired of positive and negative integers. My question is, ''@CAPS1 are you from last to greatest? ''. She replied, "Do you want me to show you?" I said, "Please @CAPS2". So she helped me for about @NUM1 minutes. During that time, my entire class sat there working. That's when people were patient with me.
Where do I start, never. When you have patience. I always push people to do something and get angry because they didn't do it fast enough or fast enough for me. I just get attitude. That's why I can't be patient, and now you know why. Finish. Teaching about the way people come, ie? ? ? .
Melt @CAPS1! I have experienced this @CAPS2 scenario when I was in grade @NUM1 at cross creeds christm school. That's @DATE1 and we live right around the corner. @CAPS3 @NUM2 minutes my patient almost got in the fact that my mother wasn't there, @CAPS3 @NUM3 minutes later I lost my temper and cried, my patient was like a ballot, as I slowly popped and Lower became more angry and. Angry about the fasting that my mom wasn't there yet. This mast will @CAPS4 happen to me again. I let Jung choose to be mad at something stupid. Learning from my words I give up as @CAPS4 to keep trying.
I'm going to tell you a time when I showed patience. When my family and my mom's boyfriend went on vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. It was packed with people when we got there. So we lined up for our first ride. We're excited for @PERSON2 to say @NUM1 teen minet wait. At first, the line moves very fast. Suddenly, it moved like a sloth. The weather was hot and humid, which was fantastic. We've checked @NUM2 minet's time. It feels like @NUM3 hours. I'm almost out of paper. Then we go into the shade, which is cool and beautiful. In the end, we were the next ones out of the woods, and it was fine. So happy for @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. My mom boyfriend timed it was only @NUM4 seconds long. We waited @NUM5 hours and @NUM4 seconds. That's the one time I should be patient.
Patience is what you need in your daily life. Being patient means you are understanding and forgiving. Most people don't have much, but others have. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not many. I have five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I'm not going to lie, but sometimes I'm annoyed @CAPS1. My little sister and little brother hate @CAPS1. But; my brother is the most hated of them all @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one who freaks out about any little thing we say or do. But this time, I don't know what happened to him. It will be fun. Once we were sitting at @CAPS2's house, my big bottle was a patient of @CAPS1, and @CAPS4 usually had his fists ready when we were surprised by him. So my sister, brother and I have been fighting and disappearing with my brother. We would tell him to shut up and even hit him in the morning. However, @CAPS4 will sit there like nothing. @CAPS4 usually beats my siting, if we usually fight, then I'll fit into it, but this time @CAPS4 doesn't care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I seriously started worrying because it wasn't like him. So I got up, slid my fingers off his check and hit him in the face, making bb blush, wearing a four finger mask @CAPS4 Been a @CAPS1 patient since we started annoying. But I think @CAPS2 at this point I cut off calling him a good guy. @CAPS4 stood up and got a slap in the face with his left hand wide open. Before I knew it, I was lying on the ground crying. I ran to tell Dad. Oh, did I mention I'm Daddy's little girl? I think you probably already know my brother is the one who got into trouble @CAPS4 had a lot of patience by putting up with these things during @CAPS3, well, @CAPS2 and, @CAPS4 was cracked by my dad so my fingers Done. @CAPS2 At least I never got into trouble. That's when Daddy's little daughter comes in handy!
Most of the time in the woods when I'm patient. This is when I hunt. You have to be patient with the deer. They don't always come, sometimes it can just be a fawn. Other times you can. Putting ??? when you see a buck is everything you first have to wait for it to get close enough to shoot. When it does, you have to wait to raise your gun. Then you have to wait for a shot. If you get it, you have to wait patiently for it to die. If you don't find it right away, don't give up. That's when I'm patient.
Once my volleyball team went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was one of the last to drop off, which means I was one of the last to place an order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered. I also talked to my friends while we waited. Next thing I figured out, what am I going to eat, (@CAPS1 cheese, burger, @CAPS2 fry and a big drink). "@CAPS3 @CAPS4, @CAPS3 @CAPS4" my eyes get wet as I look at the clock "@CAPS7, @NUM1" the lady said. "@CAPS8 @MONTH1 I take your order," she said. I told her what I wanted, she wrote it down on her register, and I started waiting. After a few minutes, I received my order. Finally after waiting patiently, I got my food. That's when I wait patiently at @ORGANIZATION1's? ? ?
People with patients are great teachers, my mom is one of the great leaders, she has a lot of patients, she has a family, she has a lot of responsibilities. She doesn't get mad and broke when we ask for things over and over, she just smiles and says no or you @MONTH1, or when she comes home from a long day at work. She never complained, she just kept smiling and did the rest of the adventure day. When she woke up in the morning to drop us off to school, she had a big smile on her face and she never complained. My mom was a very patient woman and an amazing teacher and leader. I thank her for everything she did for me, my brother and my father.
When I have to be patient is when I want a psp. So for a while I desperately wanted a psp so I asked my parents and they said I have to wait until @CAPS1. But I really wanted it but I decided to wait a long time and I finally got a psp.
I remember having to use my @CAPS10 sister's old phone. @CAPS1 Pearl. @CAPS2 is really slow @CAPS2 dropped, I'm @CAPS3 horrible. @CAPS10 Birthday is coming up and I really need one. I asked @CAPS10 mom @CAPS4 I'm getting one for @CAPS10's birthday. She said, "@CAPS5. Be patient," I really wanted to know, so I kept asking her and she said probably not. But I didn't give up. I'm really patient until @CAPS10's birthday. When I woke up, I saw the gifts on the kitchen table! @CAPS10 The family watched me open them. I turned on @CAPS2 when I had one left. I am a huge box! I opened @CAPS2 to find another box. One after another, another. Finally @CAPS2 is the smallest one. I wrote @CAPS2 and the side of the box says, iphone on @CAPS2! ! I have an iPhone @NUM1! I am very happy! “@CAPS9 what patience gets.” @CAPS10 mom laughed.
Patience Once I was patient, I was really patient. When I went to bed, I was invited to sleep. So when I get there, I can't identify when I go to the tower
What is patience? Patience means waiting @MONTH1 takes a long time but you understand and wait and not something rude. An example is when you are waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is that your parents can't afford it right now. When you understand the struggles of money and you don't start every day with mom begging for toys, you'll have patience. If you do, then you're impatient and your mom will say "stop your patience. Before you get rude and keep begging what you want others to think, understand why it might take longer than you want, and be patient.
I am writing a story about patience. Patience can be said like I'm waiting for you to finish what you've done. Things like o's like @CAPS1 have been waiting for the kids to be quiet. Even when she was pissed off and they couldn't, she was still patient with us instead of saying get out of my class and give us another chance. Because she wants us to study hard and stay in class.
I know someone who is more patient than me! That person is my sister. My sister is the most patient person you will ever meet. I am impatient. First of all, when I'm going somewhere, my sister just sits there. I would say can we leave now. My sister is always patient! So I think she is very patient.
@DATE1 One rainy afternoon, my brother's friend's mom called me and needed me to babysit. She and my mom are going soon and won't be back until 9pm @CAPS1 so she needs me here. So my mom moved me there, dropped me off at 7pm, and after a briefing on what to do if there was an emergency, I passed. I wrestled with the kids and watched @CAPS1.v as they left. We ran around and talked to each other (mostly them against me) and I turned them upside down and put them on the bed when I was slightly thirsty, covering them twice each time. After brushing my teeth and going to bed, a went there twice to read my book. I really sigh, or I turned on @CAPS1. v need to be patient to be afraid because my mm got me back.
Everyone has time in their lives and they have to be patient. The time when I was patient was when I was helping my brother learn to tie his shoelaces. I know this sounds easy, but it's not. My brother tried again and again to tie his shoes but couldn't. So I told him to get one of his shoes and I'd teach him. When we started, I thought this would be over in about five minutes, but no! He can't make bunny ears. So we tried and tried. He would get so close to tying the knot and then he would get so excited he would pull the knot as hard as he could and the laces would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use the strappy shoes, but no, he was determined to tie his shoes. After playing for more than an hour, I finally got it! He didn't tie them up, but enough to get them. I said well done and started walking towards the kitchen. When he asked about double knots. So of course I went over and told him to just go over the two bunny ears and circle around, but he didn't get it. I have to show him how to do this a billion times! But he still didn't understand. We played for half an hour? ? ? for double? ? ? I went to the kitchen to get the juice box. When it came back, my brother was smiling and proudly holding up his shoes.
I was very patient when I had to do a project about birds that included a life size model. On the model, I have to glue parts every day. But the glue takes @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of seven. I work harder than @ORGANIZATION1, but I've been blocking my awesome creations. The wings would snap and I had to patiently glue them back. I finally got it done, although it took longer than I would have liked. I used my painting, my heart, and my stability, and finally succeeded!
The one time I had patience was when I was with my mom and she decided to "let's do some cooks" so we had all the cooks ready. They look good even if they are not cooked. my mom just? ? ? Go to the oven and buy @NUM1 miners! I don't want to wait that long for my cookies. My mounts were wasted when they started to take on big, dark brown, round, soft shapes and I want them now. The timer went off over there @CAPS1, grabbed a hot pad and almost took them out of the oven! Just as I was about to buy one, my mom snapped "they need to calm down". She set a timer for @NUM2 mines! I don't think I can wait that long. My magnt was watered in small places. I'm dying, I want them so much! I thought the smell would kill me! Each mine is like an hour. Then the timer went off and I rushed over and grabbed a plate that threw @NUM3 biggest cooks while I burned my hand. But I don't care, I took a bite out of a cooking pot and I'm running out of water. My guests finally paid off and the chefs I got rated me so highly.
School. At school you have to be patient. By that day you will run out of patience. You will try to be tolerant of your patients. It will be fun most of the time. Maye If you agree with it, you will be calm and patient. But patience is something I do? ? ? Lunch and bathroom. Every day seeing a guy who has to put up with needing to go to the bathroom I have to wait @CAPS1 I'm starting to get hungry. I need lunch, I have to wait. Once I eat, I have to go to the gym patiently. I have to be patient every day of the week. I need to put up with it every week. Bye bye.
One time I was patient was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Guess @CAPS3 of @NUM1! ) @CAPS4 is @DATE1. When we parked at the ticket booth, the guy in the kiosk said, "Please sell a ticket." @CAPS5 We stopped to find a parking space. I ran to the gate as we went out. But that's when @CAPS8 sister forgot her towel. @CAPS5 I ran back to the truck and got @CAPS4. Then we put on our bathrobes. Then we went to the water's edge. The first ride I did was "@CAPS6 in @CAPS7!" @MONTH1 I mind you @CAPS4 is horrible. But I said "anyone wanna go with me?" @CAPS8 dad and @CAPS8 mom working friends say yes! @CAPS5 We're in line. This line is like @NUM2 to @NUM3 people. @CAPS5 Waiting time is about @NUM4 hours! But I have no complaints at all. But then we heard creepy screams from the ride. Then a man, woman and @NUM4 kids were thrown into the pool. Then we got their tubes and went up the stairs. We walked to the huge opening and you could see the @NUM6 foot drop and then the pink and yellow funnel. After about @NUM7 minutes, we arrived at the port where you got on the subway. @CAPS5 We are down. @CAPS8 Mommy friend (@PERSON1) is going backwards. I say "yes" and you go down. Hara! @CAPS5 We started going down, and then we went down (well, we were in free fall), but we were like @NUM8 mph. @CAPS4 is horrible. Then we sat down. Then I fell into the pool and came out. I scan @CAPS8 Mom, two sisters. They laughed at @PERSON1 because she was crying. Then she said she was not feeling well. @CAPS5 She walked over to the truck and took a nap. Then I rode the rest of @TIME1. That's when I'm patient.
When I have the patience is when I go to the mall. "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" I said to anyone behind me that my mom came to the mall and bought some @DATE1 clothes. That mall was overcrowded. No one can get into where I've become so patient. There was an understanding that it was this white family passing by and they all bumped into me. I waited very patiently. When it finally came our time, I was about to leave everyone. That's when I'm patient. I am very proud of myself for persevering. @CAPS3.
A mother bird is laying eggs. She laid @NUM1 blue, perfect eggs. Days passed and the eggs did not hatch. The mother bird was angry. She talks to Daddy Bird and he says, "@CAPS1 be patient". As the weeks passed, the mother bird got worse. Again, Papa Bird says to be patient. In her spare time, Mother Bird will keep herself busy by fiddling with her wings, shopping, cooking, and cleaning, but nothing will take her attention away from the eggs. Several months have passed. Several years have passed. Decades, centuries, millennia have passed! But the mother bird was very patient. Finally one day, the egg cracked, and she was very happy. Almost immediately, @NUM2's oldest bird took off in flight. The third asked, "@CAPS2 I can't fly yet," and Mom said, "@CAPS1 Be patient."
@CAPS1 So happy to get my first ipad. However, there was a long queue. @CAPS1, my mom keeps telling him to be patient. @CAPS1, I just stood there silently. Then, as we got closer, I couldn't wait. Finally, we reached the beginning of the line. When, I climbed up, Dad said, "What do you want?" @CAPS1 I told him I wanted big. So we put a lot of cool songs in there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day. Then I said "stop listing this music" @CAPS1 and I put it down for about @NUM1 hours. Then, it's time for my dinner. Afterwards, we went for a drive in my dad's new car. Finally, we returned home. I put away everything I bought from the store. Then I watched TV and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That's when I'm patient.
When I'm patient, we're heading towards @CAPS1 o'clock: with @LOCATION1 her parents, her brother and me. We drive there. It took us @NUM1 hours to get there. @LOCATION1 and I were very patient, we waited to get there, we exited quickly. When we got there, we all waited in line to ride a bunch of roller coasters. We all queued for about @NUM2 hours because it was a very busy day. @LOCATION1, I want to ride the highest roller coaster. It's called @CAPS2 @CAPS2 is @NUM1 @NUM4 it's the highest roller coaster. I have participated and so have all the others. To get on that ride, it needs to wait @NUM5 hours, it's redundant, we have to be very patient. But when we got to the front, the wait was worth it!
Clicked, '"Ok cool granny, thanks." I said 'welcome'. @CAPS1 said. "When are they coming?" I said. "I don't know." @CAPS2 You don't know what @CAPS3 is talking about, you probably don't, @CAPS3 is talking about the shoes I just ordered online. It's called @CAPS4 there. Omg I'm going crazy over these things. I waited @NUM1 days and every day I ask my mom, are they still there? Are they still there? But every time I do, they are not there. I started to get angry. So in the end I rode my bike and wiped it out of my mind and I saw a @ORGANIZATION1 truck and I thought yes he might be going to my house in my shoes so I ran home and wait, wait But still no shoes. So the next day I checked my shoes online and it said @PERSON1. Michigan. I'm flipping, which means they're coming. So again @CAPS3 wait, wait, my mom decides we're going somewhere. So I got in the car and left and I thought I heard the truck but no, so we finally got back to my house and I looked to the left and yeah! Are they sitting in front of me? ? In a rough brown box. I ran over to pick it up, rushed in and ripped it open, and inside lay the best shoe known to man. I tried them on (@CAPS6) and they were great. I thank my grandmother that all my patients have flown away. I feel extremely happy.
At Cedar Point @LOCATION1, I had to be patient. My @CAPS1, my sister and a friend spent the night at Cedar Point. My @CAPS1 lives in an RV while my @CAPS1, my sister and I are on roller coasters at night. About six hours later, except for @NUM1 or @NUM2 roller coasters, my sister and I went, by the way, my @CAPS1 is not like a roller coaster, it's old, so it's really just my sister and I. So playing After so much, my sister and my @CAPS1 are going back to the motor home, but I want to keep going? ? ? Before going back, so I asked if I could ask her to say yes. I told my @CAPS1 I hope to be back in half an hour. The roller coaster is the second largest roller coaster in the park. When I was waiting in line, I thought it would take a long time. I have @CAPS2, so as you can imagine, I could barely stand still, I had to work really hard, but eventually I got in the car and it was fine. By the way, the ride is amazing.
@PERSON1. I'm in love with that guy! I swear to middle school @CAPS1 when you have to be the most patient of your life! Seconds go by like your classes feel like they last centuries, which can sometimes be fine, as in social studies. Social studies is the only class I take with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him and stare at his perfect head. @DATE2 @CAPS1 Girls' Choice Dance, I decided to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies, I wrote him a note. "@PERSON1, I really like you, wondering if you'd like to go to the Women's Choice Prom with me? From @ORGANIZATION1." I held back, I couldn't have given him myself, so I made a plan. I tell @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to @CAPS3 @PERSON3 (who is @CAPS1 @PERSON1's friend) to @CAPS3 @CAPS2, (@PERSON1's good friend) to @CAPS3 @PERSON1 I like him. Rumors spread fast in middle school, so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2, but now he knows, it's time for @DATE1 and social research. Patience @CAPS1 My nature reminds myself not to go too fast. Well, I certainly didn't because the bell rang before I gave him the note. I patiently waited and waited until finally I leaned over and handed my notes to @PERSON1. He opened it, and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little patient seeing @CAPS1 @DATE2 today and dancing @CAPS1 tonight. In my locker, @CAPS1 has four, and down from the door of @PERSON1, I put a note. It says "@CAPS3 I'm your phone number and I'll call you @NUM1.". Omg! Boys are so confused, I @CAPS3 him my number and waited by the phone. I think he is testing my patience. I waited hours for my phone to be willing to ring. I want to crash, give up, and a willpower will come back, @CAPS3 I'm finally worth it. The phone never seemed to ring, so when it finally did, I thought I was imagining it. All my patience paid off when I answered! He said a word. Yes!
Have you ever wanted to do something and your parents told you "@CAPS1 to be patient? Recently @CAPS2 was patient. My family bought a new microwave and it was too big for our counter so we couldn't Don't put it above the stove. Well, there wasn't enough room above the stove, so my parents decided to redo the whole kitchen. My stepmother took everything out of the kitchen and put it in the dining room, and now we can barely Moving around the dining room. My family has been eating in our living room lately. (@CAPS3) I really don't like eating in our living room, @CAPS1 looks disgusting. But we also have the option of eating outside on the porch. So it's a good thing. I don't know how much longer I can hold on. But @CAPS2 @CAPS1 has to be patient. Finally now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put our new microwave in place, paint, put We put our stove back in. After he did that, my stepmom put all our seasonings and stuff back in and how did we get back to normal. After being patient, it did pay off. Now you know to always keep patient.
It's a warm sunny @DATE1 day! ! ! We decided we could go to every one of my father's family farms in Genesee County. We went to my dad's house to pick up my stepbrother, stepsister, brother, stepmother and my dad. We start our journey to the Genesee County Farm. We started walking around, waiting to see if it would rain. If it's going to rain, it's going to be a lot of money. We walked to the ticket booth to see if we could come back with the same wristbands when it rained tomorrow. They said no, so we decided to stand there and wait for a while before it started raining. We had to sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. At the same time, the barn began to flood. Then we got a call that a tornado had just hit a few miles away. Finally, the rain stopped and we all went back outside. We waited for the rides to start again. Once they finally started to recover, the rain started again. So we all ran to the car. We were all soaked. We decided to stop trying at the show and do something else. So instead, we all went out for toco bells and hamburgers.
One day, my grandfather and I went fishing, and grandfather always said that waiting is important. When we got to our fishing area, I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, "It's going to take a long time to catch some fish." I told him to catch a turtle and that was the last . When something is pulling on my rod, I want to pull it in, and pulling my line is a small white bass. The next thing to pull on my rod was a large white bass. I was pissed because no turtles bit my line. Next to my line was a @NUM1" white bass, the biggest fish I've ever caught, but it wasn't a turtle. After catching that fish, I said it was time to take a break. I was eating a sandwich while my grandfather was fishing around for fish. I was eating a sandwich and my fishing rod was pulling. I had to grab my fishing rod and? ? ? In my fish, but it's not a fish, it's a little turtle.
In the filthy and muddy science classroom of @PERSON2 at @CAPS1 Middle School, a boy named @CAPS2 and another boy named @CAPS3 are cleaning up their previous @CAPS7 mess from a mudball fight. For years, @PERSON2 has been trying to @CAPS6 patients on twins, and @CAPS6 patients on twins, trying to figure out what can calm them down. @CAPS7 does have @CAPS4... @CAPS5 @PERSON2. When @CAPS7 gets mad, she often wonders what they think. When teaching them science, @CAPS7 never understood. When @CAPS7 does something wrong, @CAPS7 doesn't know it's wrong. @CAPS7 has advanced @CAPS8's @CAPS8 in her class with little understanding. But as the principal put it, "@CAPS6 patients, @PERSON1; @CAPS7 will learn." @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 Months have passed, and @PERSON1 has come to trust her husband more and more. Be patient with @CAPS7 when they do something wrong and not get mad at them, their grades soon start to pick up, and by the end of the year, @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 are @CAPS11-+ students. @CAPS7 has passed @PERSON1's course. On the last day of school, @PERSON1 went to her husband's office. She @CAPS12 said his advice worked and he was a great principal. All @PERSON3 replies are "@CAPS12 you are!"
I am patient. As much as I hate patience, I can usually live with it. Like when I was at @NUM1 my mom had to go out of town for a meeting because there was too much snow and no school, so she took me to my dad's house. She forgot he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It's too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of Autozone. So I'm back in this little office (what I added @MONTH1 never changed, not even @NUM4 years later.) I'm going to have to be patient. Really patient. My mom brought this doodle thing so I could draw and it only kept me busy for an hour. Then I just had to walk around doing nothing. Until I found out that @NUM5 employees were doing inventory. Hehe, they have these carts with top and bottom sides. I drilled to the bottom surface and held on. They shoved me into the store unknowingly! I did this for about @NUM5 hours and still have almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old picture book in the girl's bathroom. If it were me now, I would @CAPS1 touch it. But I did it. I'm just @NUM1! I don't really remember what I did after that, but I know it was boring because it was implanted in my brain. Ever have a time when patience is fun?
Patience is very difficult. I go to the store with my mom and of course @CAPS1 is always there. "Come on Mom, do we really need these" @CAPS1 continued shopping. Grrr I'm pissed. I almost want to pass a fit. Finally, we lined up. When we got in the car, my mom looked at me and said give me your phone. "@CAPS2 why"? The way you responded in that store is terrible right now, I don't, I'll always be patient with my mom.
Every year I visit my father. He lives at @LOCATION1 so we stopped at the border. The border adopts @CAPS1! So my family has to be patient with them. On our way @LOCATION1 the border was packed once. Our family has to be patient or there will be some bickering. With four kids, this is bound to happen. After an hour, every patient ran out, so my dad kept repeating being patient, being patient over and over. We finally passed the boarders everyone cheered. So being patient is not the easiest thing to do. We all need to learn more about how to keep it.
Are you a patient person? Well, I am not! Well, I can be patient, I just don't want to. A few years ago, I had a Gordon Setter puppy at home. Since they are rare in @LOCATION1, we have to leave @LOCATION2 all the time. We bred her a few years later and ended up with seven very cute puppies. These puppies crawl and bark within a few weeks. My dog had a rough time when they annoyed her, but she persevered. Two special puppies are in trouble! Dealing with them requires patience. The puppies were jumping around in our pond, swimming through deep water and another climbing the wire fence, which was tough to deal with. We keep following them @NUM1! They will bark if you get them out of the water or from the top of a fence. The people who climbed the fence left our house first. I am very depressed. When two puppies were left (water dog and his sister), they ran around the house like crazy. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they turned into cute puppies. I don't want to get rid of them, but we have to. Our puppy showed me that no matter how hard the work, patience always pays off.
"@CAPS1" The doorbell finally rang, time for lunch. It feels like math class never ends. I hurried for lunch without even stopping in front of the locker. When I got there, there was a line for lunch that seemed to line up for a mile. I know I have to be patient. I was in a long queue. I stood there waiting. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood it was a very busy lunch day, so I just waited. After a few minutes, I was at the front of the line. All of a sudden, seven girls let them in front of the line because of their friends. Although it made me angry, I didn't complain and stayed patient. I got my lunch quickly. Anyway, that's when I have patience. I understand, no complaints.
My family and I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 during @DATE1 between 4th and 5th grade! The rides at @CAPS4 have lines, but none of them have lines that long, @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This line is huge! @CAPS5 thought @CAPS5 would never make it when my brothers, their best friend and I approached @CAPS2 @CAPS3. My dad said to wait, but @CAPS5 missed the point. When @CAPS5 was halfway through, one of the employees shouted, "@NUM1 minutes!" @CAPS5 @CAPS4 got even more excited. Finally, @CAPS5 came out on top! @CAPS4 @CAPS5 must wait for the current trial to end! But then the speaker started saying, "@CAPS4 rides must stop until told to continue. Thunderstorms have come due to safety concerns, @CAPS5 must." @CAPS5 made @CAPS4 consider leaving, but felt @CAPS5 shouldn't . @CAPS5 talking to some of the other kids @CAPS5 I know in line. @CAPS5 plays rock, paper, scissors and more, @CAPS5 waits under the gazebo above the line. After the storm passed, they kept us going! Riding is exciting! There's wind in my hair, little mist in the rain, and my dad's thank you for being consistent.
When I'm patient it's like when I have a dog. I went to a jazz festival with my mom, sister and her friends. We passed by the last rescue and we went to see the puppy. My mom didn't want another dog, but when she saw our future dog boxer, she gave up. His fur is grey with some black spots and a black line at the front. In the center? ? ? He's a grown-up short-haired blue therapist duo. We asked the lady if we could get him but she said they were going to exercise and we could buy him there. We got in the car, and then? ? ? arrive? ? ? . We signed the form and played with him in the store. but? ? ? Down town with him, we bought some ice cream and headed home.
I am patient when I have pink eyes. I'm patient as my family goes on vacation to @CAPS1. The first night we got there, my eyes started to itch and turn red. So we decided to take me to the doctor's office the next morning and there was no one around but we found urgent care. So we went there. We are waiting in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called @ORGANIZATION1. So we entered the room. We told her we needed to give me eye drops. She said okay, I'll be right back. Then me and my mom and I kept waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour has passed and we are still waiting. I'm really getting impatient. Finally she came back and told us she was working for another patient and again told us she would be back right away and told us the doctor would be there soon. We said yes. Another two hours have passed and we are still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he would bring my prescription. And yes, he did come back. Then my family and I left and went back to the hotel to pack up and head to the campsite. So this wasted NUM1 hours of my vacation. That's when I have patience.
I remember one time I was very patient. It was at my Cousins home. But it's boring. At that time, I was also very sad and lonely. So I'm going to tell you. Not long ago, I was at my cusins home. Everyone except me. There weren't enough four riders, so I was the only one left out. I feel very lonely. I can't believe how boring I am. All I can do is be jealous. Everyone had a great time except me. Everyone screamed with joy until they would cry because they had a great time. Then my dad??? a corner of me. I smiled and tried to look like I was happy then he asked me if I wanted to go I said yes! So I jumped on four without tomorrow. I know it can be just a little thanks to my dad and then take off. I can't imagine how much fun this is. I feel the breeze blowing across my face and my shirt fluttering on my back, which is awesome. " I hope the day never ends" I squealed happily. I had a great time that day. I've never had so much fun in my life. A lot can happen when you are patient. Even if I was bored at first it was worth it in the end, that's when I had the patience.
Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! @PERSON3 is hurt! "I yelled. "@CAPS1? how? ""@CAPS2 bleeds on the corner of the freeway because the fence @PERSON1 is with him. ” @CAPS3 replied “Dad! Call @PERSON4 @CAPS4! Nana shouted "@CAPS5 let @PERSON1 in!" shouted Nana. "@LOCATION1, @CAPS6 we @CAPS7 Leo!" "@LOCATION1, @CAPS6, Nana and Pops took @PERSON3 (@PERSON3 is a horse) to the car dock to give him a look. After hours trying to keep him warm @PERSON4 arrived. They let @PERSON3 Conversation. Then started dressing him. They tried to get him to stand up, but @CAPS11 won't. @PERSON1 and I were in the house waiting to see if @CAPS11 survived. @PERSON1 decided she was going to help pass the time. They and @PERSON3 for his mom @CAPS8. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she put down the table. @CAPS8 kicked @PERSON1 into a tree. The next day @PERSON2 and I pitched a tent in the backyard. So horses can Cool down. Nana called the vet to see what @CAPS1 they could do. They got @NUM1 mins later they said they'd stitch him up. See what else they could do @CAPS1. They stitched him up 3 hours. They said to watch him to see if their sutures would have a cut. They also said they would check him on the next @DATE2. @DATE2 came and they took him to the statuses and Taking care of him for a while @CAPS11 is finally under control. This is how I showed patience in @DATE1.
I have endured it many times in my life. But I think this one will most interest you. Finally we go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a large indoor water park located in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I've wanted to go here for years. When we got there my first thought was "heaven", little did I know it was the biggest line I've ever seen. These lines are not just for rides, but for everything. After two days of fun, this is our last day at @CAPS1. So I want to ride all the rides again. My mom told me to put on my swimsuit so we could go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park, the shortest line I saw was probably an hour. I'm so disappointed I can only keep going like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to leave "heaven". We left @NUM2 thinking we would be home around @NUM3. We are on our way home. I'm bored and feel like @NUM4 but it's really only an hour. It took us a long time to get home because the snow was so bad. I asked my mom when we were going home and she said be patient. So I just take it as it is. " @CAPS3 we're home". I said run in. In the back of my mind, I thought it was the longest ride ever. I looked at the clock and it was @NUM5. @NUM6 is longer than we thought. But I have to go to bed right away (but no video games). That's when I showed my patience.
I believe patience is a good quality in a person. Patience is good because you have to wait and not get angry with frustration. For example, if you are in ????? there will be a lot of people waiting in line? ? ? , if you're patient, you'll wait, but if you're not, you'll probably get off the line and leave. When you're patient, people might be right now? Impatient people get angry quickly and can't wait. While waiting for things? ? ? , which is not good. My conclusion is that I believe patience is very important in life.
I've been patient but now my friends and I are saving up to meet @PERSON1! One ticket is @MONEY1, that's a lot of patience! So imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! It's hard to be patient, especially when you're going to meet a celebrity you're most obsessed with! I have been very patient in this process of saving money. No matter how difficult it is, I can do it patiently. My friends have been patient and still are. I mean, if you're going to meet your favorite celebrity, can you be patient? Well, it's not easy, first of all it takes a lot of patience to do the chores and take care of your animals, plus how much money you have. It really sets you back when people lend you money. But like said, no matter how much we have to save @MONEY1 plus tat to meet him, we will be patient throughout the process of saving. It's fun because you can take some lessons and you can see and learn how to be patient. General patience is everywhere and you use it for many different things in your life.
I have a great friend, she's @CAPS4's best friend, we've known each other since @NUM1 grade, then in @NUM2 grade she said she said she had to move to @LOCATION1. So she moved and she called me twice a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until the day came, she called @NUM3 because there was someone at home. A @CAPS4 mom friend called me and I told @CAPS1 (@CAPS4 best friend) to wait for someone to call me and she said ok so I left the phone on while she was still calling Got the @CAPS4 bed. I went to the living room and @CAPS4 mom's friend said can you get me a glass of water and five other @CAPS4 mom's friends said something. I'll go get them water. After that @CAPS4 mom said to take out the trash so I went and put on the @CAPS4 scarf and took the trash out like @NUM4 mins and I made her wait. @CAPS4's best friend was her when I took out the trash and she said @CAPS3 can you hang out with me for a while, I forgot everything about my @CAPS4 friends on the phone. I was out for about @NUM5 minutes. Then said I had to go back. I came in and sat on the couch, @CAPS4 mom's friends chatting at home, I sat together instead of talking, laughing, playing, watching TV for two and a half hours and telling myself what I forgot while watching TV . I know I forgot something but I don't know what so I got up and walked around and told myself what I forgot when I got to the room I was talking to @CAPS1 I saw the phone on the bed and I picked it up and said @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 I forgot about her. I said hi just to see if she was still there, even though I had a feeling she wasn't there. She told me you made me wait the longest time ever. I told her wow, you are so patient, I would never wait that long. Come on she, you are @CAPS4's best friend. I'll be waiting for you forever, so we keep talking.
Are you patient? I know it's hard for me to be patient! I'm usually impatient because I really like doing things on the spot and I really don't like waiting. I can bear it! I can be patient when I wait a short time. Usually I like to be in a hurry, not in my work but socially, I am in a hurry! Patience means waiting, usually without complaining or complaining. An example of patience is when you go to a party at @TIME1 and it's @NUM1 and you have to wait a long time! Usually time seems to go by so slowly! Patience is a very important quality. That's why I work hard to be patient. You should too!
Last year, @DATE1 was my birthday, so I told my @CAPS1 what I wanted my @DATE3, and I said "@CAPS1 I want a @CAPS2" (@CAPS3 radio @CAPS4). So @DATE2, we went out at 3am to get my @ORGANIZATION1, we better get it. So we walk to the store and we open the door and there must be more than @DATE4 people in the store. So we went to the scene of the game. I she and they are two texts and they are five of the part so we grabbed one of the two. But when we got in line, the store was already half full. And then we waited forever in that stupid line, it was like hours for us to get to the front of the line. We got home at @TIME1. This story is not about patience as I want. So I waited patiently for two and a half hours to buy my @CAPS2 and whether you waited patiently or not, you will get better consideration and treatment than you expected.
One day my dad and I decided to go fishing. He spoke for another five minutes, so I sat in the car. Finally I came out to sleep with him and it said @NUM1 minutes.
I have patience when I am at home watching my little brother buy groceries for my mom and my brother is crying because @CAPS2 is sleepy and hungry so I put him on the bed and I have to be patient because @CAPS2 is very Oops, my mom was wearing a robe for a long time, she had to do other things like buying clothes, @CAPS1, shoes, when my brother woke up @CAPS2 was crying, I couldn't stop him crying when my mom stopped , @CAPS2 stopped crying, @CAPS2 started laughing, that's when I had the patience!
I won @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I am in @CAPS4 and @CAPS4 very @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 show my patience not @CAPS8 @CAPS9 i @CAPS10 so i got @CAPS12 line seuot in @CAPS13 in @CAPS11 in eveone.
I'm writing about a time when someone I know is very patient. He has to be patient with one thing: @CAPS1. When I was very young, I nearly drowned once in a hotel swimming pool. I have been afraid of swimming ever since. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim in the pool at his trailer park. However, he will have to wait patiently for @CAPS1 to enter the deep end of the pool. He wants @CAPS1 to go to the deepest part of the pool, but I'm afraid I'll drown. So he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 to the bottom somehow. We got out of the pool and went to the deepest point. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he should have realized I wouldn't just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into deep water, but all I had to do was hold on to the edge to stop swimming or something. So after that, I just went out and he started to get a little frustrated. He is patient though and continues to work with @CAPS1. After a few hours, he pretended to give up @CAPS1. I told him that if he stayed, I would go to the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn't that bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in deep water. This is how my friends' hard work and patience paid off for @CAPS1 and him.
That was @DATE1 and I @PERSON1 applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I have applied on @DATE2 and patiently awaiting a letter from @ORGANIZATION2 to @CAPS1 @PERSON1. Since @DATE1, I've checked my mailbox every day. Every day as I run down the driveway, I wish that day was the day that letter came. I'm scared because @NUM1 in @DATE1 has passed and still no letter. It's like waiting for that moment at the climax of a movie when you think the protagonist will act. @CAPS4 is the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and I'm having lunch. I thought to myself "@CAPS2 is a must day." I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mailbox and hitting the door. She sees me every day when I meet her smiling postman. Every day she sees my smile go away as I check an email address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looked at me and said "@CAPS4 is that day." Patience is a hard thing to get, but I had a fair amount of it on @DATE1.
I was patient one time when I really wanted a game called x-men @CAPS3 wolver and my mom said I had to do it until @CAPS1 wandered down the road. I can understand why she said that, because we were short on cash at the time, so we had to stretch out the rest of the time a bit. Weeks passed and I completely forgot about the game, then on @CAPS1 day my sister and I were going downstairs very fast, and then when we started giving gifts, I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go get it, I open it, it's x-men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and drag other games I want to offer I go to my room grab my @CAPS5 and headphone pop x-me @CAPS3 and play it all day
One day I had to be patient because I asked my mom if I could go ice skating but she told me to be patient so we waited until she said yes. After waiting, we were pissed because my mom had to go and get money for my sister. So be patient next, but if you're not patient, you won't get your way. Like one day my sister Haven and I wanted to go to the movies with our friends so we had to be patient for an hour why we had to wait until Mom got off work because she could give Haven @MONEY1 and me @CAPS1 @MONEY1. So you are so patient.
When my friends and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 it was very busy. We had to wait a long time, @CAPS1 my journey we? ? ? Waiting a long time to get on @CAPS1, my friend was very patient and I wasn't. I keep complaining about how long it took. @CAPS1 Eventually we got in the car and had a great time. The wait was horrible, @CAPS1 it was worth it because the ride was @ORGANIZATION2. This is the best ride in the whole world.
It's hard for me to write an experience where I have patience because I'm not a patient person, but I'll try. Can't wait to come here for the first three days of the Cedar Point tour. I did try to get it to rush through, but it didn't work. I've been out of school for @NUM1 weeks now and I've done everything I want. We always have fun (of course) when my mom, sister and friends go. Every night since then I know we're going to Cedar Point and I'll sit there thinking that one day a lot of kids will ask and complain to their moms there, "can't come again" but I never, I don't know that no one can make time go by faster. So I waited to do my chores, pack my bags and watch TV. Trust me, it's long and boring and I'd love to complain, but I don't. This happens to me every time I take a deep breath. Compared to other things, say just wait. I will also think how lucky I am to be able to go to Cedar Point. I know I'm a very impatient person and I'm working on it. That's what I'm trying to do while waiting for Cedar Point to appear. This is what the patient means to me, and what it means in my life. This is also a time of patience in my life.
Be patient. Well, when I had a little cousin from @LOCATION1, she was adopted from the draft, so I never saw her because I only saw her on the hillside and in photos. So before she sounded cute I heard her on my phone and I miss my ants and my uncle too, I haven't seen them in NUM1 years. Out @CAPS1 still waiting for them to come tomorrow or today. I was surprised.
Here's a cool @DATE2 @TIME3. The sun was just rising when I entered my blind box. It's snowing @TIME1, but only @DATE1. Then I'm at the upper penisaala of @LOCATION1 again. I'm looking for a monster ten with my brand new @NUM1 and @TIME2 guns that can kill a dear @NUM2 yard. I've been sitting for an hour and it feels like a day. I've only ever seen one square horned beast and it looks interesting, but not in the hurry you get when you see a deer. "@CAPS1, @CAPS1!" I looked in the direction the voice came from. "@CAPS1, @CAPS1!" @TIME2 shot as my adrenaline kicked in. "@CAPS1, @CAPS1!" I saw the movement put my scope on it, and I saw it. Is this a grouse? I glared at the gun to calm down and watched it eat some corn. This is @NUM3. By lunchtime, all I have is a turkey sandwich, an apple, and a bottle of water. When I saw a brown figure move, I started eating the apple slowly, looking around. I picked up the gun with the apple in my mouth. So imagine @TIME2 coming alone. He had an apple in his mouth and looked in the scope. When I looked I realized it was his big @NUM4. Huge horns, a huge body, he was probably five or six years old. I put my crosshair behind my shoulders and I turned the safety off. Slowly pull the trigger. My mind was blurry, "@CAPS4!" Perfect shot. Later @TIME2 I found him and he is big @NUM5. I had him install it and that's what he is now.
Am I patient when I have to wait in line for @NUM1 hours to ride? ? ? . Then I got on it and took off at NUM2 miles per hour. I got stuck for five minutes and then it fell off? ? ? @NUM2 mph. I got out of the car and rode it for a few miles and I faced it. drop is? ? ? . Ride time up to @NUM1 minutes? ? ? @NUM5 people. I went to the powa hour it was sence. mine? ? ? Reply is fun. I'm back @TIME1. I got up and had breakfast. Impatient on everyone the whole time.
I'm patient when it's about @NUM1 because I'm in @NUM2 grade now I'm @NUM3 now but back to what I said I said I was seven years old in @NUM2 grade and I'm standing on the lunch team these kids keep making me Queued for lunch and I just sat there waiting patiently for myself. But I'm just standing there, so while we're doing other things, I'm patient when we're standing up, I'm fine, it's ok because I still have to eat.
One day I was waiting for @CAPS1 @NUM1 to quit the game to stop while I was patient. I was watching the signs of the game until the day @CAPS1 @NUM1 came along and I said "@CAPS2 must be a good game". So instead of waiting when the game stopped, I went home and played @ORGANIZATION1 football @NUM3 on my xbox @NUM4 and then I was tired, tired, more tired, so I was on my inspiring game He slept in the chair until morning. My brother woke up and said "let's go to gamesstop and find @CAPS1". So we went to the game station and waited in a long line for about an hour and thirty minutes until it was our turn to buy @CAPS1 which was priced like @MONEY2. I had @MONEY3 and my brother had @MONEY1 and he didn't want to put any money into the game and I said "I'll pay @MONEY3 and you'll pay @MONEY1. So we brought the game and played it and told us we beat got it.
It's a way I have to be patient, we all know? ? ? Must be patient with others. ? ? ? Yes, that is my birthday. I didn't think about my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no, I didn't think about asking for money, not money in the first place. The second gift, yes, has money. And so on until I get my last gift. This is a card, so there must be money in it. I can't wait to buy something with it. Be patient, I had to wait, wait, wait. It took almost five months! Do you believe? ? ? There are so many? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , and wait that long? Well, it paid off anyway. When I finally got it, I couldn't believe it. It's the best thing in the world. That's why patience is hard to do if it's over time, but it's also a good thing because it takes a toll every time.
Tick, tick, tick, tick. Every muscle in my body was urging me to run to find my father. Tick, tick, tick, tick. But I stayed where I was, my eyes scanning the crow. Tick, tick, tick, tick. instead of me seeing him. Tick, tick, tick, tick. I ran up and gave him a big hug. The clock in my head stopped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 will tell you my patience. I think I was really patient when I came back from a trip to @LOCATION1 with my friends. I was waiting at the airport for my dad to pick me up and I was so excited! You see I've been away for two weeks and I'm really homesick. I gave everything to not go to him, but I knew I couldn't just run away, I had to be very patient. It was worth it in the end because if I went looking for him, it would be harder to find him. As you can see, I thought I was patient while waiting for Dad at the airport. Thanks for listening.
This is a story about my patience. That was @NUM1 @DATE1 and we were on a plane about to go on a cruise and when we got to the boat I was so excited I was thinking how much fun I would be thinking about what my room would be like and going to all this very Cool new place. So we got on the jetty and there was one line and I waited patiently to get on the bus, @CAPS1 there was another line to check your passport, so I waited patiently. @CAPS1 There is also a fixed line. It was to get our room key but I was patient and waited a little longer and stood there for a while and it was done, but wait you never guess, there is another line. So like all the other lines, I'm standing on my iPod and listening to music. They my dad said "ready", I said "ready" and he said "no" look at your "room and relax". I am so excited. Finally, we no longer finish lines for white. So I opened the door with my very special key and we had to wait in line and look at my room and it was amazing. But the bathroom is a bit small, but great. I'm happy to finally not use lines anymore! That's when I'm patient.
Once I was going to meet my friend who lived at the end of the street. I walked there, admiring the sight of the setting sun, young people playing casually. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me, but I didn't trust him enough to wave at me because he looked weird. Don't be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. About @NUM1 seconds later, she replied, "Oh, hi @CAPS2!" She exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to the park and waited. I sat on the swing swinging back and forth. An hour has passed. I sat there patiently. I didn't know if she would come out and decided maybe I should go home. It started to get dark. She was outside when I got up. I told her I had to go home because it was late and I could be back tomorrow. That's when I have patience.
A @CAPS1, I was very patient when our flight arrived at @CAPS2. We were going to @LOCATION1 that @CAPS1 when the @CAPS2 logo popped up on @CAPS5. I'm kind, but I say I have to be patient! Our flight is ?????? & @CAPS14. So while we were waiting, we did a lot! First let's go to the food court to listen! We went to Chile. We also had to wait for our food! There are some good hashes and they are very good! Then we went to @CAPS6 @CAPS7! At @CAPS6 @CAPS7 I got @NUM1 keychains for my friends! Then I got myself @NUM2 magicians and read @CAPS10! I got some @CAPS11 @CAPS12 too! They are very good! Next, we just walked around @CAPS13! Then we went to sit down and relax for the @CAPS14 couple. Then I fell asleep! When we woke up, we were almost ready to board @CAPS15! I'm very @CAPS16 finally getting to @LOCATION1 and enjoying all the weather in @CAPS17! I learned that patience is really important! That's when I'm really patient
be patient! Patience is a great study skill. The three steps of being patient, quiet, not complaining, and waiting if necessary. My mom and I went hunting with my stepdad @PERSON1. We must keep quiet so the deer can come. We sat there quietly. I think it's the quietest I've ever been! All of us are tired of being quiet, but we have to do it to make money. It's cold and I'm wearing warm clothes, but I can still. We have a small heater on our head. We can't complain about being cold or tired. Or just wait so we all sat there without complaining which was fine. When I was about to ask if I could go in, I came out of the woods at ten o'clock to find something to eat. We wait patiently for the executor to approach. @PERSON1 Load the gun and pull the trigger. The buck jumped up and ran. Shoot! We came out of our heads and looked for a blood test. We had to wait a while to find the deer, but it was pissed. The right way to be patient, keep your mouth shut, not win and wait. A great study skill is patience. have patience
Being patient is a very important thing for me, but one day I learned my lesson. It was @DATE1 and my mom woke me up at @NUM1 and she said we had a lot to do. When we got in the car, I had no idea I was going to have to be patient all day. First of all, on the way to the @ORGANIZATION1 market, we encountered a traffic jam for about @NUM2 minutes to an hour. When we finally got to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to queue for about @NUM3 minutes. I told my mom that I was going to leave, but she said I had to be patient and that being in the hospital was a bad thing. After leaving there we had to take my grandma to the doctor and it took them almost two hours to call her by her name. Then another @NUM4 is required to check out. After we went to buy some clothes and shoes, the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for about four hours and most of the time we were in line. Finally, we went home because it was time for Mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to try to be patient because it's part of life.
At @CAPS2 on the left, you'll have to be patient. Patience means you understand and tolerate. A patient person encounters difficulties without complaining. There is a @CAPS2 in life when I have patience. Yeah! Jager! My mom took me and my friends to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called a lot of friends and told them if they wanted to go. Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and jumped into the jars. We all looked out the window. My goodness! Look at those big roller coasters. A friend of mine shouted. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was @CAPS3. Highest and fastest coaster out there, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, and we decided to move on. Wow! The lines are huge. We all say. I shouted out, it's okay, I heard it was a great ride so be patient. In the meantime, we waited and waited until we were finally the next riders. We kept riding and then all of a sudden it started, we don't know, it only lasted for @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours, but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really think patience is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from @LOCATION1 that we should all be patient because wherever you are, you need to be patient.
I remember getting impatient once when I called and said she was going to send me @NUM1$. @CAPS1 I asked her when to send it and she said @DATE3. Today is @DATE4, which means I have @NUM2 days. @CAPS1 showed up the next day??? Truck came, I thought I had money, but it wasn't @DATE3, @CAPS1 I said: "@CAPS2." @DATE1 came, I was still waiting, so I tried Via "@CAPS3 it! So @CAPS1 is @DATE2 and they have a discount on my favorite game "Bully" The case has a yellow tag that says @NUM3, no tax at all, @CAPS1 I'm pissed, @CAPS4 back Home. My dad woke me up and said "it's @DATE3" I @CAPS1 I got up for breakfast @CAPS1 checked the mail, @CAPS1 it bills, bills, bills and "my money" I sent us a ??? .At the end I said I had money, so I bought some ice cream @CAPS1 I bought my favorite game "Bully." "That's when I had the patience.
Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and gibberish are part of patience. In order to play on any sports team, you have to be patient. I say this because you may not always get the pass or score, but you are still important to their team and your time will come. When I have the patience it's on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game that carman - the @PERSON1 Girls @CAPS1 team was against flushing. A young lady was not fouled for flushing (I didn't even see it, honestly I'm not even sure it would happen, but you can't argue with the officials) she was taking a free throw. She wants forever! I'm surprised her footage wasn't captured. What is she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didn't say anything. I'm just standing well and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) and she didn't take any of them. Anyway, I'm proud of myself, I'm very happy with myself. I just realized now that I didn't have a face, didn't say anything, didn't think anything in my mind during the time I was standing there! I'm just standing tall and thinking about my own thing for the first time, wondering if it's going to come in. Then on the second shot (you can now ban) I just assumed the box position. Sit down, but put your hands out to face the basket. I was really happy for myself, I even told the girl that it was a good shot. So patience is worth it. One, I got rebounds, my teammates got points, and I got assists. Second, I show the opposite correct way! No one is perfect, you have to wait and see who will score the next point!
This is my first game. I was ready to go in and the coach was yelling and I was right next to him. Then he said you're going to the next game. The assistant said no, I didn't say it out loud. I have no complaints throughout the process. I never said a word to anyone. I have helped others. It's still fun. At least throughout the process, I didn't complain and created value for others. I've been on the sidelines. Never entered without an ounce. I am patient. Not that I'm not angry. At least I stood there and did some exercise. I have always supported my teammates. I encourage. I help shape or form in any way. I hear them complain. But I did give support. There I was so pissed I could kill. I was ready but my coach said no. It has my time to shine. That stupid word got in my way, no. But at least I learned something.
When playing turkey you need to be very quiet and quiet and you have to have a lot of patience. If you move a muscle, all the turkeys will run away. Sometimes you'll sit for hours just waiting for a shot. I remember when I was hunting under the tree with my dad @CAPS1 about three hours and the last turkey came and unfortunately my dad scared them all away just as I was shooting but I Still have the patience to stay there for another @NUM1 hours. This is my example of patience.
One day two years ago I was going to visit @ORGANIZATION1 train @CAPS1 waited @NUM1 hours and once we got there we had to pack to the last line because my mom forgot the ticket so how did we wait we got to 21/@NUM1 Hours only started, gay told us we could tell him our names, he could find our ticks online, my mom was really pissed, but we gotta keep @ORGANIZATION1 The train was really fun. That's when I had to @CAPS2 pachiant more than @NUM3 house handle in extreme heat.
In my opinion, patience is when you wait for your turn to do something. Impatient means it's not your turn. Throughout your life, you have patience because sometimes you may just have to wait. I am patient, and I know a lot of patient people. I was trained to be patient when you do something in no rush because you will screw it up. Don't slow down because then people will think you don't know what to do. You can paste right in so you can do it right the way you want. Impatient people are not always happy.
Have you ever had patience before? I have and this story will tell you everything. On my birthday last year, my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone, but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, months passed and I still haven't heard from my uncle. I started to get frustrated with him because he promised to give me that phone. I told my mom and she said he's always been like this, to keep my patience, what if he's late. I'm thinking I'm almost a year old! Then on @DATE1, my uncle came over for my family reunion. Then he told me he knew I thought he forgot the phone. I knew he was right, but just then, a little light bulb flashed in my head, and he couldn't forget it. Soon it was time to eat and that's when he showed me the @CAPS2 touch. I was so excited I jumped up and hugged. He told me that whenever he promised me something, he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth the wait, and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is tested, keep your cool, everything will come soon. To wrap up the story, I would say that patience is important because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. @CAPS3.
You'll say you're on the board fast. Most of the time it's because when you're out of the woods there's nothing you can do but look and waist, if you make a sound you'll get nothing. Hunting is about sick people, but when that doe, stag, or whatever you're hunting is a ritual in sight, it's a huge reward. Sometimes I was impatient, and sometimes I was patient when I was young. I'm important and I get up and walk around, but as I got older I became more patient. I got my first deer and it was an eight. Hunting @MONTH1 with patients but I love it and its fun.
The one time I have patience is when I have to do some @CAPS1 and my mom is on the computer. My @CAPS1 needs a computer. She told me she only had a few minutes. So I waited, and I decided to watch an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants while I waited. When the episode ended, I went back to my computer. She's not finished yet! So I made some bagels and they were pizza on mini bagels. I ate @NUM1... wait till I get to @NUM2 and I'm starting to get full. But I keep eating. I ate and ate. I am really hungry. I was finally full so I decided to stop. I went to check if mom was finally done, but she wasn't yet. I go out and do sports with my friends. We were there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2 tired and eventually we all went home. When I walked in the door, I looked at the computer that was still in use. I went to take a shower, because taking a bath is very comfortable. I stayed there for a while because it was so warm and soothing. I'm going out. I'll go upstairs to change. I went downstairs and didn't expect my mom to be here! I went to get in the car but she came in and said it was time for bed so I got up early to do my @CAPS1. It takes a lot of patience as it is difficult to wait so long.
Once I was patient. We are a way of understanding this. We have family with us. We are all in @NUM1 cars and vans. I'm like the van @NUM2 and the car, and the @NUM3 in the car. It's like a @NUM3 hour drive. I'm in the car with my mom and @NUM1 sister. We were there for an hour. First, I was on the shrine, then I just talked to my family for an hour and I was very patient. All I can do here is make my mom wait patiently for us to get there. I'm like no, no, I want to be there @CAPS1. She loves us all day. Then we stopped to eat something. Then we are there.
I had to wait patiently once when we drove to @CAPS1. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, little sister (@NUM1 months) and my aunt. We spent about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours in the van. When we got to the hotel, it was @NUM4 locked for @CAPS2 time, and at @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am. I'm tired of being patient, I'm not a very patient person, so my mom is very proud of how I behaved when the baby was crying and stuck in one place for hours. It was difficult, but it turned out great!
It's hard to be patient. I hate waiting. For upcoming events, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort without effort. I really never have the patience. I don't know many people, neither do they. Having my mom "claim" to be patient, she's not! One of my least favorite phrases is "patient"! I get nervous and frustrated when @CAPS1 is hospitalized! When @CAPS1 is waiting to call someone, I'd love to call them a hundred times. When I want to be patented (never), when I want to be patented, when I don't know if I'm going to get impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 is done writing the page and the time hasn't come yet.
My mom started making my @DATE1 gifts when I was @NUM1. She is going to make a blanket. Sadly she didn't find the blanket. I have to be patient. I have, but not done, then? ? ? . My @DATE1 is almost @NUM2 months ago? ? ? . she? ? ? Looking for time to go? ? ? that her? ? ? Look for? ? ? in @NUM3. I've been patient and every year my @DATE1 and @CAPS1 I ask if it's done and I'm not. Yes? ? ? Can I bear it for a while? ? ?
The one time I had the patience was while fishing. Where do we fish on cold nights, where we fish, no fish. I just @CAPS1 patiently picking sunflower seeds. My dad is pissed and I'm still listening to the backeasard celtcs at @CAPS1. We only caught small fish that night, nothing to eat or raise. We set off at one o'clock in the morning to tug the boat, and I was dark and cold. I eventually had to get into the water, put the boat on and tie it up. On the way home, five miles from home, a bent tractor tire blew. I still have patience, but my father doesn't. We stopped to look at the tires. We didn't have a spare car so we drove home. This is the most patient I've ever had. For @CAPS2 this writing sample, she could have explained what a millennium is. That would make things clearer. She can also stop using me to start most of her sentences. That would be more intense. In the third sentence, she used yes instead of. This will make her sound smarter and get better grades. In the second paragraph, I didn't know she mentioned @TIME1. or @TIME1. It would make the story clearer if she said it was morning or afternoon. If she corrects all of that, this will be a good sample.
I'm sitting in the lounge area when I'm patient. I ordered my drink and Mike was the first. Then, when we got the food, they said it would take about five minutes, so I sat there, and fifteen minutes later, she came back and made the wrong food, so I lost my patient. So I relax. She came back with my meal at that time. Correct makes me happy. And I was really hungry so I ate fast so when I finished they gave me a free descont because they mixed with my meal. My mom bought me something from the store because I have such good patients. That's when I'm very patient.
We're going to @CAPS1. My cousins and I are so excited! We are waiting to ride the skyline. After we finished eating, my my cousins and mine? ? ? to the skyline. Skyline gave you all? ? ? Cedar Point. "I'm so excited," said one of my sisters. "Me too!" said another. We are heading towards it. It really took a long time. We were shocked when we saw this line! "It's going to take a long time," my sister said. I'm surprised my @NUM1 year old cousin she? ? ? ? ? ? "Wow, it looks so tall" my cousin said. "@CAPS2't worried we have @CAPS3. She'll take care of us," my sister said. Finally it's our turn. We have @NUM1 kids behind us. Want to continue being so bad. "Why @CAPS2't you keep going" my cousin said. I'm shocked my cousin has so much patience. Usually she's already starting to want to do anything first! I am proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. I hope we can come back again!
Patience is a hard thing to have, but it pays off. I had a teacher who no one remembers who gave us transcripts in band class. So a few weeks later, I made a bet with him that if he didn't bring us our transcript the next day, he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks passed, months passed, until the end. It was the end of the year. And he still hasn't. Once schools reopened and we were halfway through the school year, my band teacher walked in and gave me two packs of drool. Then I remembered the deal we made and said? Yes, just assumed to me, he told me "The second is? Be patient."
Patience is a valuable thing. Every day I go to the basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I'm doing @CAPS1 because I broke my ankle while playing football a few weeks ago. Sitting in the gym watching your friends play for an hour and a half takes patience. Every time @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play basketball. I can choose @CAPS1 to watch the game, but I have patience. So I go. It's boring to just sit there, but I did it to watch and play @CAPS2 years. You now know that patience is a virtue. Doing anything requires a lot of patience. Are you patient? Patience is not when you sit somewhere for a while and get angry with someone. This is when you are calm and waiting.
I had patience last year at @CAPS1. Some of the reasons I've been patient is to keep silent, or as you know, keep quiet. @CAPS1 It's not hard, but it's hard for you and me when you have to be patient. Pacents are the key because you will have to use it for a long time! But let's get back on track. After finishing on @CAPS1, you must wait for your classmates to finish. So, in your free time, you can read a book or check your work. Pacents are also important because when you use @CAPS1, you can't rush things. You have to take your time and know that you are timing. This is where pacemakers come in! Sometimes when you're done @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today and I say it's because of other people! If everyone in the classroom doesn't have a pacemaker, then @CAPS1 is most likely to fail. You must have a quiet and quiet room! Now, you can and will do well if everyone in the room is silent. When I'm done I have @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacemaker because I care about other people's work habits using @CAPS1. I know you don't have @CAPS1 anymore, but it's getting slow! When I get my grades in grade 7 this year, I hope I'm doing well because my classmates and I have kids! Remember that pace is the key to success!
One day at school @PERSON2 was waiting in line for his lunch when @NUM1 kids suddenly appeared in front of him. @PERSON1 Say to the kids, you know you have to go to the back of the line. "@CAPS1 We didn't. Says the kid. Minutes later, a girl named @PERSON4 (@PERSON2 loves) was walking to the back of the line, but @PERSON2 said she could cut in front of him. So she did. Once @PERSON1 Got up with @ORGANIZATION1, did they get food and they were waiting to pay, when kid @NUM2 locations away from @PERSON4 he couldn't remember his student @CAPS2 number to figure out he was a new student. So they had to Made him. A student @CAPS2 number and he paid for his food. In the end they passed @PERSON4 and had friends to sit down, but @PERSON3 had @CAPS1 to sit because his friends were outside. So @PERSON4 saw him and didn't Asked if he wanted to sit with her, so he did. Finally he finished @PERSON4 Asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to hang out between classes, he said sure, but a friend of @CAPS3 hasn't finished eating, so they can't Don't wait for her. When she's done, the outing is done and this is @PERSON1 waiting for the bell to ring to get inside. He's pissed, but he has to hang out with @PERSON4 all the time.
Last time @DATE1, when I was with my dad, I taught my brother, friends and me how to make merchandise. I really can't do it, so I tied it up first. Using all the steps my stepfather told me, and being patient with myself, I was ready in the water. Unexpectedly [literally, we were on the lake] I improved my skills like @CAPS1! No, I can do it all! When the water level was over, I took my boat to the cabin. I insisted that she cry when the bell rings. But when we got down to the lake, I practiced at the lowest point a few times and came here to decide if she would definitely try to practice. We sat there for an hour, waiting for her decision. However, in the end she decided not to try. I was proud that day because I didn't try to convince him to try. I am very patient with her. Although in my opinion she made the wrong decision, I am not proud of what I have done on this ship.
When I was @NUM1, my mom was always impatient and angry! But one day she was going to take a shower, but people moved on, she was patient for a while, and I went up. I hid when I saw her. When I peeked through, she was still standing there, almost falling asleep, still patient. Another guy walked into the bathroom and I quickly went there and said, "@CAPS1, sorry, my mom is coming, she's been waiting. So I woke up my mom "Mom, get up and take a shower!" " Then she woke up, took a shower, and came out "ahh, feeling good" so much better. " End.
My mom got pregnant with my @NUM1 sister when I was about seven. It was the night before she got her. We all fell asleep. When my mom started screaming, we all went into her room and my dad asked her what was going on and she said "she's here" baby. Then, when my dad realized, he forgot about us. So when he came home to pick us up. It was morning and they took us to a room. They got my mom ready. My little sister and I were waiting in the seat next to her. Then when they took her for an ultrasound, we had to wait. It was finally time to send her. My sister and grandma and I had to wait outside the room and we were very patient and it took over an hour to get her out. I took my little sister to clean up while they were giving my mom stitches. When we can see her through the window. I gotta see her first bath, injection When putting these patches on her I thought she was @CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room, my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 little sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was very proud of how patiently we waited for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. We all love this name. I was so @CAPS3 that day.
Patience is something many people don't have. I'm somewhere in between, sometimes I can be patient, @CAPS1 other times I'm not. Patience is understanding and tolerance. It also means you can get through tough times without complaint. Every year I'm not that patient, every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go to @LOCATION1 on Labor Day and take the bridge. The rule is, if you don't complain, you get fudge. I thought I wasn't going to get the fudge because of my muscle strain in my legs the night before the embers burned my legs. I know I have to be patient to get the fudge. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, summoned all my confidence and patience, and started striding. Every year we try to break our bridge walk time and I think my legs are slowing us down. So I told myself "be patient" over and over, and I accelerated the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes (because my legs were worn out). I knew to break the record we had to walk two miles in less than 20 minutes. We're going faster than I thought and my legs feel like @CAPS3 is about to burst! I can't do this anymore. I know I have to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs keep telling me "@CAPS2!" @CAPS3 won't stop me, @CAPS3 is: suffer and be patient. If I want fudge, I have to be patient too. So I ramped up and accelerated to the finish line, not only to get the fudge, @CAPS1 to break our record too. Thanks to patience, I got delicious fudge and we broke the record. It was a moment I will never forget because I was patient and I held on until I crossed the finish line. That's my patience and I'm glad I have patience with my legs. I'm not very patient, so thank God for your patience!
Once I was patient! Patience is tolerance and understanding. Sometimes when @CAPS6 is in a bad mood, when someone asks me a stupid question or makes me nervous, @CAPS9 be patient. I was sick and upset one day (last year) because it was going on a @DATE1 holiday and my little sister @ORGANIZATION1 wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream tins that go every 20 minutes at the ice cream shop, that It's about seven ten blocks away from @CAPS9. I was bundled in my blanket by @CAPS3 while she @CAPS9 danced @CAPS3 on my bed. "@CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I want @CAPS9 to buy ice cream. @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!!!" @CAPS5 I said in a mean voice. @ORGANIZATION1 you little hob - goblen get off my bed or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 you @CAPS9 A @CAPS10! ! ! I was young and in a bad mood and the cries sounded so stupid and lethargic. @CAPS9 There were tears in her eyes and at that moment I didn't realize she was very young (how old) and didn't quite understand that I didn't fall well. I apologized and explained that I was sick. After she ran out of the room, ten minutes later, she came back with a cup of hot tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said "I asked mom to make you tea". That's Hart warm @CAPS9 me. After I finished my drink, @ORGANIZATION1 asked me if I felt better. I said a bit and @ORGANIZATION1 put @CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I'm very patient with her and she hasn't fully understood yet. So I got @CAPS3 and took her @CAPS9 to the ice cream shop @CAPS9 to buy some ice cream. @ORGANIZATION1 Glad it makes me so happy. I'm so proud because I made me nervous on the eve of @ORGANIZATION1. I know I was impatient with @ORGANIZATION1 at the "start", but at the end I was patient.
This is @DATE1 @TIME1 and we are at @ORGANIZATION1. We all want to get on board and take care of it. We got to the boat cautiously, everything was ready, we tried to start the boat, but there was nothing. My @CAPS1 and cousin took the seat back off and dug a few times on the back where there was water from the boat way and the gondola pump had stopped working. My stepdad looked and they said to rewire. He quickly rewired the boat, but it still didn't work and all the kids were getting restless now. Every adult says we need to be patient. Everyone calmed down and walked away. Soon we heard a boat that sounded like my @CAPS1 launch and we ran there excitedly and sure enough it launched, we hoped it launched, and we went down there. Later that day, my mom said to me, "Patience is a virtue."
I have been patient because of my sister. Sometimes it's easier to be patient with her than others, but most of the time I can handle it. I think this is a good example. A chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mom's room and I saw her putting on makeup. I asked "@CAPS1 did you make @CAPS5 good at makeup?" @CAPS2 responded with "patient and years of practice". After I got my pocket money the next day, I asked my mom "@CAPS3 Mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1 later?" @CAPS2 replied "@CAPS4, @CAPS9?" I replied "@CAPS5 I can practice makeup". "@CAPS6." @CAPS2 said. When we got there, @CAPS5 had so many options to choose from! I asked my mom to help me choose the best one! After we checked out; it was time to go home and practice! Sadly, my first makeup class didn't go well, but I did ask my mom for help, and @CAPS2 said "@CAPS8, I know you'll figure it out soon!" I wondered "@CAPS9?" , @CAPS2 almost whispered, "Because anyone can pay someone else to do their makeup and hair, but few can or will spend time with patients to learn about themselves."
As my @CAPS2 and I entered the checkout at @CAPS1, @CAPS6 heard impatient moans and signs all around us. Almost every line was long and the whole store was packed. I moaned along with the others, annoyed by the long wait. My @CAPS2 continues her pleasant whistle and doesn't seem to notice. "@CAPS2 This will go on forever!" I whined. "@CAPS3 won't be so negative. Not so long." @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 grinned at my reaction. "@CAPS5 about @CAPS6 playing the game?" @CAPS6 continued an eye spy game for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line progressed slowly. After @CAPS6 finishes playing our game, @CAPS4 keeps chatting, then checks her checklist to make sure @CAPS6 has everything while I play on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 came out and I breathed a sigh of relief thinking it's a good thing @CAPS2 keeps us busy! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store, my @CAPS2 said, "@CAPS7, when you're patient, you get food!" @CAPS6 all laughed and drove home.
Every year my whole family and I go to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 beach. Everyone in my family is me, my mom and my dad, (???). My little sister, my three cousins, my aunts and uncles and my grandparents. We live together in a large hotel, usually with @NUM1 bedrooms. We only stay for two weeks throughout the year. So I have to be very patient for the remaining three hundred and fifty days. When we were there, we would fish for sharks and stingrays, hang out on the beach, and swim in the ocean or pool. So definitely worth the wait. I've always had a lot of fun and now I'm patiently waiting for next year.
I remember it all as clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago and my mom, two brothers and I went to @PERSON1 o'clock. The drive is about an hour and a half, maybe two. I'm super excited for a new ride at @CAPS1 - @CAPS5. With nothing to do, just listen to the music and stare out the window, this car ride becomes forever. Of course, once we got there, we still had to do a lot of other rides. We usually work from the front and do things in order. I don't mind that as we mostly ride big roller coasters and take in a few rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind kept getting distracted from the maverick, how crazy and funny I was at the time. Unfortunately, once we get to @CAPS5, it's hard for me to be patient as the line is almost an hour and a half. Considering this is a new ride, I guess the line is to be expected. After waiting for so long, I finally got in the car. @CAPS5 is amazingly epic. In the end, all my patience paid off and I had a great day.
I'm going to write about my sister's patient visit to the dentist. One day my mom said she was going to take my sister to the dentist. My sister is very happy. My mom had to go elsewhere too. First, we went to costland mall and bought me a dress to go home. After that, we had to go to the shoe factory to buy me shoes. Third, I go to get my hair done. Finally, we were on our way home, but I told my mom that my little sister had to go to the dentist. We had to wait @NUM1 minutes when we went to the dentist. I tell my sister @CAPS1.MG all day that you have been patient. I can't do that.
Why hasn't my uncle arrived yet? come on! I mean there are trapped stakes on my back, falop for? ? The only thing I need help with is my phone. @PERSON1 @CAPS1 Where's my uncle I'll look back soon and see what went wrong: I'm at my uncle's house waiting for him to hurry so I can go hunting. I don't wait. Open?? The door is quiet? ? Hang out with my @NUM1. Guage, then I ran to work on my tree stand. We've had this stad for a long time? ? can remember. What I see now - is a bad thing. what is the ladder? We think it will break. The top bent and broke several times in various places. We kept telling ourselves we would rebuild it, but we never actually did. So after climbing the ladder I let? Come to me and wait. Hunting takes a lot of patience, but I don't. Standing on the horizon of the tree was the biggest stag I've ever seen, and I almost said it was beautiful. Fit the stud into the barrel I'm aiming for? ? Boom my shoti zzz+++! I'm out of luck! The studs slope to one side. I reach for the gun so I can put it on? ? ?? Sow even the edge. Gun landing bend? ? I even turned around to see the studs fall off. I turn around? ? si am I facing? ? and tried to stand up but my leg was stabbed. Then a serious crash! ! ! Stud fell into my ?? stuck on my back and I tried to move but my back hurt so bad my ?? ? It started to bleed. I was lucky I didn't break my neck so my question esd I was impatient at first. But I learned my lesson and wanted and was patient enough to wait until my uncle was within shouting distance. I got into trouble and learned the hard way to be patient
So one day in fifth grade, I was running around the playground, and when "push" I pushed a round off the slide? ? ? fell my arm so it went? ? ? Or are they miserable? ? ? Went to the doctor and waited for two hours and I just sat patiently, motionless, watching other people come in and out, finally they called my name and they told me I had a broken arm and couldn't be there for us Got a cast across the road to another doctor waited @NUM1 mins, got a blue cast about a month later, I took it off and went back to the x-ray room, but then said I have to get another cast this time? ? ? Eventually took it off and that's when I was patient.
My patient time is when I go to @CAPS1.BI @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a lot of training and he was there for @NUM1 months. Finally, if they pass, they will be rewarded. So there are a lot of people. We have to dress very nicely. We had to put up with all the people who got awards we didn't even know about. Worst of all, they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like a few hours, my dad woke up! I'm so glad he won the award! Then we have to leave. That's when I had to endure.
go with! @CAPS5 Coach shouted. The @CAPS5 football team and I are sprinting to warm up for today's game. @CAPS5 day planned, first football, then @CAPS5 friends birthday party. I can hardly wait. That's when I felt raindrops on @CAPS5's head. Before I knew it, I felt another, another, another! Suddenly it started pouring rain. The @CAPS5 team and I rushed under a nearby awning. @CAPS2! The thunder almost shook the ground. Finally the referee came over and announced, "The game has been postponed." I signed my autograph on the picnic table and was sluggish. I know now that if I want to pass today, I will @CAPS7 be patient. We sat under the awning, rain on the roots and thunder crackling. "@CAPS1 Can I join the @CAPS5 party now?" I passed. @CAPS2! @CAPS2! @CAPS2! More thunder came. Play must be played without thunder for @NUM1 minutes to resume. Before I knew it, we were at @NUM2 minutes. Even the slightest thunder, we need to start with @NUM3. We are at @NUM4 minutes now. We listened until we heard @CAPS2! Frustrated from the far north, I said "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 mon!" The @CAPS5 team started a few more minutes. Finally no sign of thunder or rain after the longest @NUM1 minute of @CAPS5's life. The game is on again! The @CAPS5 team and I rushed to the field. We played the hardest in that game but sadly we lost @NUM6. We left the field in white socks, our sweatshirts spilled. with mud. We were all soaked wet. @CAPS5 Mom gave me the "@CAPS6 up" emoji and I hurried to the car. "I'll still be at the @CAPS5 party, but I'll be a few minutes late and I'll switch cars on @CAPS7." I said to @CAPS5 self. As I sprinted through the wet grass, I heard the @CAPS5 coach yelling from behind me: "@CAPS7 was having fun at your party @PERSON1, @CAPS8 was so patient!" I laughed and replied "@CAPS8 Coach!" I realized that day that patience is a great quality for @CAPS7. When you understand it and don't follow it in difficult times, a lot of people embrace it.
On the way home from the doctor? ? ? .I'm annoyed by existence? ? ? I don't want to make mom more angry. So I try to stay calm. One time I'll play on the seat. @NUM1 minutes have passed and I'm getting more and more patient. Buy I still keep +roln. As soon as I got home I went to bea to relax
I had to be patient when my dad was waiting to get money for our chiuahuce @CAPS1. That was @DATE1, my dad sold his guitar to his uncle to get money for the days he didn't have it. A day passed and still nothing. When my mom came to pick his? ? ? I went to swimming practice trying to wait patiently for my dad to get the money. Around @NUM1, my dad called and said he wouldn't get the money until @DATE2 @TIME1! I was pissed, but still trying to be patient. A few days have passed and soon it will be @DATE1 again. I am so excited. We finally got @CAPS2, I've been waiting patiently for a week and tired of it. So my patience was worth it when I was him. That's when I have to wait patiently for the good stuff. It really paid off.
Patience is what you need to accomplish anything in the world. An example is how schools use patience. One way is to understand your teachers, because they will help you teach you for life. If you don't have the patience and understanding of your teacher, your life will be nothing. Another example is your parents. You need to be lenient with them, and they will be lenient with you. If you're impatient with your parents and don't listen to them, you won't be able to learn all the life lessons they give you, and without their skills you won't get anywhere.
Once I met a girl named @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They were inseparable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 made more friends and started to become very popular. @PERSON1 calls @ORGANIZATION1 daily to see how she's doing or if she wants to hang out. @ORGANIZATION1 has been lying to @PERSON1 that she is busy, always lying and blowing her away. But one day @ORGANIZATION1 had a really bad day when she tried to tell her new friend about it and apologize for the way she acted. @ORGANIZATION1 learned that @PERSON1 is truly a true friend and has been patient with @ORGANIZATION1 during difficult times. This shows that if you are really patient, only good things will come.
Once I got into trouble with @CAPS1 on my transcript and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. So I went upstairs to read a book. After an hour, I came down and asked. How long have I been grounded? She said I don't know how many times I Sow I bug her all day. She said my patients are running out. I said can you tell me she said yes. She took out a piece of paper. I said what is that? She said I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve "Oops"! I said twelve days, that was the last, and I said yes. I think I'm going to learn a lesson today? Don't bother your mom all day, do better at school!
One nice sunny day I was out for a drive and all of a sudden my mom yelled at me that she was going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to buy my new merchandise and she said I can’t go to @CAPS5 I sit and wait, wait, waiting. Then I decided to play the console @NUM1 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) @CAPS5 I played for two hours and then I decided to watch @CAPS6 Assassin (@CAPS7). After that, I went back to playing in playstation @NUM1 (ps@NUM1.). Played for another hour. Then all of a sudden I heard beep beep @CAPS5 I looked out the window and that was mine. @CAPS1 mom. Then we discussed the new qlad and then I heard the beep and it was mine. mine. New @CAPS8! . Then I ran out to get it out and took the @NUM3 hour strait for a spin. This is how I patiently waited about @NUM4 to @NUM5 hours. I'm so proud of myself after riding the new @CAPS8.
When I make an appointment at @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, I am patient in the waiting room. Some of my teachers said to wait because the teacher was talking to other people. I've been patient when any @CAPS3 teacher says don't turn it on. When someone told me to wait. I'm also patient when I'm waiting for the bus, plane, train. When I'm bored sometimes, I wait patiently. I am so patient.
I'll tell you all about the time I had to use patience. I had to use patient while I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box @NUM1. When my friend tried to fix the x-box, he was waiting. All I did was sit in the chair and watch him. After about seven or eight hours, he finally got the x-box fixed. Once my friend and I started playing the game, it broke again. So we had to bring the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for them to see. I have to have patients because if I don't I'll be really bored. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system, they told us they had to accept it before looking at it. @CAPS1 @CAPS4 It took almost four days to fix the system and get it back to me, so I had to have patients to deliver the system. The patient is something very needed in life. Now you know that time in my life when I have to have patients.
"@CAPS1 on". my little brother said. The @CAPS2 line will be fixed forever. "@CAPS2 was our last @CAPS2 ride". We took the space mountain at @ORGANIZATION1, located at @LOCATION1. I let out a sigh as we line up on the ride, @NUM1 mins to @CAPS2 point. It was hot and it felt like I was walking with a smile. The line doesn't go any faster. My brother is very happy for some reason. No one can understand us lining up in @NUM2 weather. I waited as patiently as I could, I just hoped to queue and hope to pay myself and we could take our order. The first hour has passed and another sigh has come @NUM3 hours from @CAPS2 o'clock. We are all angry. The walking trails sounded quiet. I know everyone can hear the pin drop or someone's drop? hit the ground. Everyone is patient. In the end, it took us @NUM4 hours to continue @NUM3 rides. That was the first time I was a patient like that.
The one time I had the patience was when I got to @LOCATION1 in the car. I was in the car for eight hours, my cousin @PERSON1 was driving and my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was in the seat next to her. I'm in the backstreet with their dog @CAPS3. My cousin @PERSON1 keeps talking. I tried asking to stop and go to the bathroom to get food but they were "botton" so I waited an hour for my friend to come over so I tried to ask again and I got the same answer "botton" so when I asked my patient Time.
A sunny day after noon I was so waiting because. I'm going to see my favorite band. When I was in school! My mom picked me up from medium rare and I was so excited it was time to go. My dad dropped my brother off at my grandma's house (he was just doying so he couldn't go.) I said to my seut "mom are we there yet?" I asked "@CAPS1 we have two hours and then There's still an hour so we're going to see the place here." Mom said "@CAPS2, please give me my dvd." Me aside. So now I've been in the car for two hours. Then we went to every place my mom and dad wanted to go, not where I wanted to go. Then it's time to go check it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! I was a little sleepy when we left, but that didn't stop me. I was going to sleep when they only played two songs. I spent the whole day looking at them, and then I went. That's when I patiently see my favorite band.
I remember one time I had to be so patient, it wasn't even funny. I had to patiently get my new phone. My mom told me I was going to buy one at the beginning of the school year. I waited until the school year started, but my mom told me I had to wait another week because she didn't get paid for all the school supplies she bought. So I waited another week. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents planned a trip to @LOCATION1 that week, so I had to wait another week. The following @DATE1, when I was at my cousin's house, my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone, and I'm so glad I finally got it. So I guess when you're patient, you get cool stuff.
One Christmas about a year or two ago, we drove to my grandparents' house. They live in cold water, so it took about @NUM1 hours. All the relatives around my father were there. All the presents are under the tree and I can't wait to open them. The parents were just talking nonsense, I opened my mouth and said "Can I open the presents now?" We said we were going to open the presents, but the adults had to go first. They are the slowest gift openers ever, and I was about to rip gifts from them and open them, I didn't think that way because I'm patient. After they were done, I said, "yes" sure think my little cousins have to open the next one. Let me tell you they're not fast at all. After that, I can finally open my present. In the end, I got an x-box @NUM2 and more than @MONEY1, which was worth it. That's when I'm patient.
A patient is a very difficult thing in life. This is one of those things that people sometimes fail to do, even with small children. You can tell when someone is patient and when they are polite and wait their turn without complaining. Sometimes people don't like patience, I know I'm not a big fan of @CAPS1. Impatient people tend to @MONTH1 don't they? ? ? Call someone else. But patient people, they sometimes become irritable or quiet, and even if they can talk, they don't talk much? ? ? Speak when people bother them. They definitely don't yell like everyone else. It's good to have patience because you'll grow up? ? ? (Partially unclear) Good family good friends and a ??? . So all in all, this is why patience is good.
When you have patience. It's when I read the story of the book that I won a book. I was at the bookstore and I wanted to read a book called tayler swift in @LOCATION1 when I was a schoolgirl and my mom said if you have patience it's ok, I'm glad because she knows I like it tayler swift's book and her life. I stared at it and read it as soon as I got it. My mom said thank you for your patience I welcome you I said thank you for buying it. I told my mom if we could go to the bookstore, she said no today, I kept asking, she said no, I kept asking, she said maybe. So I listened to the radio with the car and when are we going to the mall and there is a bookstore in the mall and I asked if I could look around and my mom said yes and she said find a book you don't like I found it and she said. This is when I have patience. One thing I've learned is if you want something, be patient and don't keep asking.
When you have patience. I am very patient when I go hunting. I know there comes a moment when the last of my life may come out of shouting range. If there is, I will be ready. The first time I shot a deer was with my mouth. I remember sitting there waiting as patiently as possible for a deer to come into range. Then I heard leaves crunching. Where is the deer I want to shout? ? How do you pull it back. I can feel the gliding arrows shoot out of my bow more than when I shoot. Then the arrow hits the deer with a bang, and the deer takes off. I want to be on my tree ready to blame my deer. My dad and I softened it up and it was there. I was so excited, everyone was yelling. Good to know that all my patients and hard work have paid off. Thanks for reading my story. Hope you like it.
Patience takes a lot of patience. One time my sister wanted to hate me but I didn't let her come to me @CAPS1 I have patience @CAPS2 I got it so I was watching TV She was standing on mission @CAPS3 Can you walk away in front of the TV? she moved she sat next to me and kept in touch with me it didn't bother me at all she asked me over and over again "@CAPS4 i am @CAPS5 you" i said '@CAPS6' i'm going to do it against me i say so you don't bother my face @CAPS2 i'm really pissed so she tried her best to rip up my homework so i said i don't care what clever comments she has i keep watching tv so i'm patient with her she said i'm going crazy so i Ignore her she got mad and kept saying did you hear me I just went outside and said to myself I can't let her come to me @CAPS1 we'll end up fighting I go back to the house and sit down and tell her you can't make me mad , so you probably won't stop, so she says girl whatever, I'm ready to say something, but I'm not going to feed her anything and leave.
I write when someone is patient. My mom was patient when she got the money that day. She wanted it to come, but it did, so she was angry for a minute, but the next day it came. I said I told your mother it was coming today. When money is a bee, do I get it? ? ? You thought she was. That day was when I wasn't doing it anywhere. And patiently didn't call people and ask them where her money is and things, the next day there was nobody at her house, then I arrived and then we wanted @MONTH1 their money and got every??? We? ? ? The mall I was raided made me and my siblings happy.
I remember when I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my stepgrandmother and go fishing for @CAPS1. I didn't really do it because I'm a very impatient person. The creek where we were going fishing was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and walked into the "backyard." I threw my fishing lips into the water and waited. After about @NUM1 minutes or nothing (except my sister grabbing most of the stuff.) it finally started to unravel. Excited, I hid in my seat and knocked it over to grab the real thing. I twisted and twisted the handle for what seemed like forever, and I picked it up. The fish was tiny compared to the fish my sister caught seconds later. My step-grandmother threw the fish back. After another @NUM1 minutes, I got depressed and went for a swim. After swimming for an hour, I got back on my rod and decided to be more patient. I wait until my line starts to move and then I stand up and then twist the reel faster? ? I caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited a full hour before my line moved. Then I caught another fish. Delighted, I put down my rod and told my step-grandmother. My patience allowed me to catch the biggest questions of the day and learn something new.
Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up waiting and that patient. As an example of patience, let's say you queue @NUM1 hours to get a ticket to your favorite band. Now waiting in line for @NUM1 hours is patiently getting tickets. Go out and complain or something. Being patient is showing respect for yourself and others around you. But I also think everyone can use a little patience. I think people should think more about patience. If everyone in the world is impatient, the world will be a mess. Example: @CAPS1 will also wait for these. Everyone will wait first. It might just be crazy. So I'm glad there's patience in the world and people have patience.
I am patient when I go to the doctor. My mom and I have been waiting for almost an hour to call me. Twenty minutes later, the nurse called me. She said sorry for your waiting. thank you for your patience. After that, my mom took me to grab a bite to eat, so we waited for @NUM1 minitus and later gave us drive-by food. Sorry, thank you for your patience.
This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I didn't have @NUM1 to write at the time, and my mom didn't complain about waiting for her to be patient. Patience doesn't mean you're begging all the time. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad says he'll give you some pizza, be patient with that pizza. When you are patient, people will be patient with you. For example, if you are watching TV and don't want to get up, but people will patiently wait for you to get up. Patience doesn't mean you keep asking. For example, I asked my mom for candy at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, don't know if I'll have the patience to wait for her answer, I'll get candy, but I don't. This is my story and what patience means to me.
A very patient person I know is my old teacher @PERSON1. He's a very patient guy, even though we made him nervous. We don't understand him explaining a million times he's still patient. Even though we have an attitude towards @PERSON1, he is still a patient guy. I think @PERSON1 is determined to be patient with us because he has to pray because he is always patient with us. @PERSON1 is the most patient teacher and person I have ever met? ? ?
Be patient, what is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear this word? wait? I know it's the main word on my mind. This is a story of when I was very patient. Every kid is afraid to test it's @DATE1 and we have to be completely silent. It's hard enough to keep quiet. But it's even harder when you're with your friends and your girl. We had to do meap writing and writing was the worst for me. But when I'm done, I feel very nice and quiet to other people. That's the story I had to be patient with.
Patients are a very difficult thing for me sometimes. For example, when I go to a restaurant to eat while we're waiting for food, it's easy for me to serve it. When I had a sore ankle from a football injury. Months later, it's still hurting in the same place. @CAPS1 My mom has an appointment with my doctor. When I went to the doctor, she felt like I had a lump or a fracture in my ankle and said "I don't think there's something wrong, but we can't be sure." @CAPS1 She sent my mom and me to an emergency on @NUM1 , with a note saying I need an X-ray. After about a twenty-five minute drive, we arrived. We waited in the X-ray waiting room while the kind lady checked us in. My mom texted my sister that we would be staying for a while. I had to be patient as we waited there for an entire hour! Obviously, this is a time when I have to be patient because I'm already nervous about a possible ankle fracture.
Patience is a wonderful thing. Here's an example of my patience on my birthday. My birthday is coming up and I am very happy. I always rewind my days, so I have a personal calendar to count down. After that, I made a lot of birthday lists. I went to the store to see what they had. For example, I saw these beautiful shorts with a matching belt. @My birthday NUM1 days before I will not eat. I also went to @LOCATION1 to see all the great cakes. The day came and we went to buy all the things I wanted. I conclude? ? ? I am patient.
The time when I am patient is when I have to patiently complete a difficult task without any help. Nobody comes from me. too difficult. I have an hour to finish it. I need three hours to finish. It's so hard that even a college student can't do it. @ORGANIZATION1 is the hardest competition test I've ever done.
"@CAPS1, how much longer." I complained at the airport, "@CAPS2 has been waiting for about two hours." "@CAPS3 Only a few more minutes, dear." answered my @ in a stern voice CAPS1. "@CAPS3 better just take a few minutes because I really want to go to the @CAPS5 world." I complained again. As you probably know by now, @CAPS2 is at an overcrowded airport. @CAPS2 had to wait six hours before our flight to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 very patient, I don't think I ever have. During the first hour of waiting, I was really bored. I have nothing to play except my Game Boy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy object that folds up. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That's the only pleasure I can use to keep me busy instead of falling asleep. I am bored. But luckily I found @CAPS8.V. They are at the airport. @CAPS2 goes to @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 can watch is news. I don't like watching the news at all, so I played my Game Boy. I played for about an hour. I haven't said anything to my @CAPS1 in the last two or three hours. I didn't want to disturb her, so I left her alone. The next hour passed and @CAPS2 finally boarded our plane. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS3 was a painful but unforgettable experience. When @CAPS2 boarded the plane and found our seats, my @CAPS1 said to me and my brother that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I don't understand why my @CAPS1 and dad don't '@CAPS8 like to fly somewhere again.
@CAPS11 is @DATE1. @CAPS11 is approaching @CAPS1's birthday. @PERSON1 will be six years old. He's helping his @CAPS6 make his birthday cake. After they finished mixing the cake, @CAPS1 @CAPS6 put @CAPS11 in the cake pan. She put the pan in the oven for @NUM1 hours. I can't wait to finish my sufer yammy chocolate birthday cake! @PERSON1 said. A few minutes later @PERSON1 asked if his cake was ready. '@CAPS3 @PERSON1 says @PERSON1 @CAPS6, '@CAPS4' about @NUM2 hours and @NUM3 minutes and your cake is ready" "@CAPS5, @CAPS4 will always" complain @PERSON1 "you" must Use your patience @PERSON1" she said. @CAPS6 What is patience? "@PERSON1 asks "patiently waiting for something without complaining @CAPS11" explains @PERSON1 @CAPS6. "@CAPS7 You can do something @CAPS9 and time flies faster. Likes to play games, ride horses, hang out with friends, or play with the sand. "@CAPS8," @PERSON1 said, "I'll do something else. ” @CAPS9 @PERSON1 went downstairs to play his video game. When he was done with the video game, he checked the oven to see how much time had passed. Two hours and thirty minutes left. @CAPS9 @PERSON1 decided to go out for a bike ride .He put on his helmet and got on his two-wheeler. He went for a spin on a nearby trail. He saw his friends and went on a bike ride with them. After the bike ride @PERSON1 asked if they wanted to go to the sandbox Play. They all say yes. @CAPS9 They go to the backyard to play sandbox. @PERSON1 and his friends have created this huge sand country. @CAPS11 has a big castle, @CAPS11 has a moat around @CAPS11.@ CAPS11 occupies the entire sandbox. @PERSON1 goes in and asks how much time is left in the oven. "How much time is left in the oven @CAPS6? " Ask @PERSON1" is only five minutes," his @CAPS6 said, "you should take the time to brush off all the sand. I see you and your friends are covered by @CAPS11. When you're done, you can invite them for a piece of cake. When @PERSON1 and his friends took the sand off of them, they all went in, holding a piece of cake. After everyone ate the cake, they all said, "@CAPS11 is the best cake ever!"
"@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2!" I yelled. We just got tickets to my favorite amusement park in the world; @CAPS3 @CAPS4. "@CAPS5 down, @PERSON1," my @CAPS2 told me. "I'm here," she said. I'm usually not super super, but I just love roller coasters. Removing @DATE1 and @CAPS1 to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is also good. I live at @LOCATION1 so the drive is not that short. My @CAPS2 just gave that guy our ticket. "@CAPS6 Your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4," he told us. "@CAPS9, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first?" my @CAPS2 asked me. "@CAPS10 about @CAPS11?" I asked my @CAPS2 "@CAPS12 isn't it?" she responded. By the way, if you don't know my name is @PERSON1. But it doesn't matter. Important to get @CAPS11. My @CAPS2 and I waited in line for about an hour. It seemed like it would take a while, but before I knew it, we had our seatbelts on. Now I know @CAPS11 isn't the biggest ride, but it's still big. @CAPS4 Yes, I'm a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before the first ride, and as we went uphill everything started to get smaller and I started getting more nervous. @CAPS11 is finally a big hit! After @CAPS11, we rode mantis, @ORGANIZATION1, evil @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS17, average @CAPS18, @CAPS19, @CAPS20, @CAPS21 and @CAPS22. "@CAPS23 vs @PERSON1, take the last ride," my @CAPS2 said @CAPS24 It's easy. We haven't started my favorite ride yet. "@CAPS25 continues to use the power of @CAPS26," I said. We got in line. The sign said it would take two and a half hours. @CAPS24, I've been riding and it's definitely worth it. The wait was a bit long to end. After waiting for four hours, I wanted to leave in three hours. I waited, though, even though I didn't think it was worth it. It's totally worth it. The wait was horrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I'm glad I waited for the best ride.
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Around the middle of @DATE1, my family and I are going? ? ? @Location 1. ???/ in @LOCATION1. I'm too excited? ? ? those days? ? ? and all my? ? ? (partially illegible) and accessories. I got pumped? ? ? My mom and my brother are in the morning??? My dad and I are ready. We packed everything into the old one, ? ? ? @NUM1 we can go.

I'm going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for someone to do something. An example of this could be if someone else is fixing something for you and you're really waiting for them to finish so you can move on with your life, but it's something that takes time, maybe a lot of time, But if you want to get it right, you're going to have to wait. Sometimes you are not waiting for a person, but an inanimate object, like a TV show, that cannot be rushed, although sometimes you want to be in a hurry. However, with humans, if you urge them to do something (which can happen, @MONTH1 doesn't end up working well, even breaking within about ten seconds after they do, but @MONTH1 ends up happening faster. You might also Also fighting for nature, like sunny days. When @MONTH1 has been raining for over a week. You might also be waiting for power to come back in a storm. For me it really wants power to start over in a storm, Because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also waiting for you??? Like when you are bored.
I was patient once, when I broke my thumb because I didn't complain that it didn't cry. Doesn't really do anything because I don't think it's even broken. I really didn't bother me. Then I waited to see the doctor, checked it out and the doctor didn't think it was broken because I nearly fell him, but he took an X-ray just in case. When he came back with the X-ray he said it was broken and he was very surprised, I was surprised by everyone.
My family and I went to @CAPS1 this past @DATE1. When did we go in Flagstaff? ? ? This is basically a big ski area. When we reach the top? ? ? . I'm scared of me? ? will follow. When we get to the top, I can see the flagpole or something? ? ? .I was dizzy and I didn't like the highs and I started to pass. I was happy to queue downstairs. When I come down, I fall better, and then I still like that I have to get up again. ??? I love my mom and ??? That day was the worst day of my life. I was very happy the next day. When we go to @ORGANIZATION1.
It can be hard to be patient at times, especially when you have to be lenient with small children. Well, I have to do it sometimes when I visit my little cousin @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 is eight years old and makes me nervous. She asks stupid questions and does stupid things and I don't like her at all. My mom said, "You two will be best friends when you grow up," @CAPS1, yes, I don't think so. Whenever I visit her, I just have to put up with her and be patient. Now I have to deal with her, but when we grow up we may be friends, but maybe not.
I was patient one time when we went to Green Bay, @NUM1 got into our @CAPS1 and when we finally got into @CAPS1 it was @NUM2 where the time was @NUM3 our time and I was a little upset. The next day we went to play with us, my sister was pissed, my mom wanted to buy a van, we tried a white van, my brother and dad liked the white one, but my mom and stupid sister didn't like the white Dodge van , we tried the silver van, my mum and dumb sister love it but me my brother and dad hate it oh we got the silver van, it took @NUM4 to get the du van, it's stupid to go home. @ CAPS2
Patience is the only way? ? ? ? ? ? Patience is waiting for a while because??? If you wait a long time without getting mad at reading, then you are all the patience people have. Will you have a good life if you keep this habit? ? ? ?
I first learned patience when I was little and my mom said she would play @NUM1 with me and I wanted it so badly but I had to think about it so I did it and I waited and waited and then If thought it was a whole month and nothing happened I was just pissed but I didn't do anything so we went to Walmart and she bought me a play @NUM1. I am very happy. Then I asked for an Xbox (seventh) and my mom said wait I waited @NUM3 months and still got nothing. @NUM4 months no, @NUM5 months no, I'm just pissed, but a whole year passed and I got @NUM6. I'm glad I have my own room and @CAPS1. I have an xbox @NUM7 which is great to be older.
Oh I have a great story about patience! One day, I was home to my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. My two brothers, my little sister, my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, and myself were there. My, @CAPS2 is all of a sudden ready for ice cream @CAPS4 and my siblings start yelling, I'm going, I'm going! Lathan? , my @CAPS2 asks? I replied that I am not involved in it! I know you @CAPS6 how long this will last because this is @CAPS4 getting a little weird and I'm sad, @CAPS7! queue! they are very good. So, happily, everyone was lining up and starting to choose the ice cream they wanted. We have vanilla, strawberry, mint and cookie dough ice cream options. Once someone settled down and enjoyed their ice cream cones.
I was patient when I went to the docteis? ? ? ? ? ? I have no complaints. I had to wait @NUM1 hours. Then, when I went in, I went a few ways and it took about @NUM2 hours. Then they took some tests and I finally got home. That's when I'm patient.
Once I was going hunting. We got to @NUM1 or earlier woods. When we got there, we found a place to sit on the ground. We're going to stay in the woods until dark or we'll kill our deer. We saw the dip when it was or @NUM2½ hours until dark, but when we moved the gun to shoot it, it ran. We stand still or talk and wait. Then more deer came. But they were really small, so we let them go. When they had @NUM3 minutes left until dark, the big drop came. It was too far away, so we waited for it to approach the roar of the rifle. It fell, but lay still alive. We waited @NUM4 minutes or more and it died. That was the one time I was patient.
There are many ways to be patient, such as patting in the lunch line or queuing to leave the room. This is my time to be patient. It's time to go ice skating this trip, I'm talking to some people and I want to go right away, but I'm not saying it because I know I have to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to go in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I didn't say anything. Then we walked in and skated, but there was a long line for the skaters but I didn't push or shake my way I waited patiently. Then I finished skating and left, @CAPS1, how can we be patient.
Patience, can you be patient? Some are, some are, some are not. Sometimes I can't. Well, heard a story about patience. Once on the school lunch line, it was a long time. It will move. I'm so hungry for lunch, I'm impatient. But for some reason, my friend was patient. I said to her, why are you so patient? Because everyone will be able to get something to eat, she said. I said yes, that's true. So I tried to be patient, and before I knew it, I was sitting next to my friends chatting and eating my food.
I'm bored" I'm bored, but I know it's going to take a toll. Am I flying around??? It cost/heavers. After that, I go to the bathroom, have lunch, eat more sellfon, I slept and then I @CAPS1? While we were there?????????
I was patiently waiting for my shill test in gym class today and I got a great result in @NUM1. We had @NUM3 biols in our class so when it was my town the wait was quiet and it took half a minute to complete. We wasted everything on shilling will and I was waiting to play dodgeball. It started because we didn't play dodgeball. So I pretty much waste my invitation on the shill test, which begins to test my story, and ends.
When I really wanted a @CAPS1 bike crank and I had to make money for it, I had to be patient, so I went to @CAPS2's house to pick leaves until I showed them the forklift driveway. At @CAPS3 time I have the money to buy my @CAPS1 bike. It was hard to be patient, but in the end it paid off.
A day of horrible patience "Can we leave now @CAPS1. I'm so bored I'm complaining." I waited for an answer, but I guess he just ignored me. We are here at @LOCATION1 waiting for these lazy guys to load his truck. Impatient guy. "That's it, I'm going to talk to these guys and see what the whole hijacking is. Wait here, don't touch anything," @CAPS1 said. So I sat here bored and hungry and waited for hours. Finally my @CAPS1 came back and told me it could be another @NUM1. Something impatient people resort to. We sat here and became very impatient. We decided to just go for a walk. After we were full, we went back to the truck. Urban slickers are simply stupid. A forklift driver did not manage to get his forklift stuck in the trailer. That's when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out of the car and then only heard shouts and screams. finally! After a shoutout from my @CAPS1, we're finally back on the road. I learned that day that the one thing I absolutely don't have is patience.
The time I asked @NUM1 to be patient was when I played football for the first time. I wanted to go in but I had to wait. I waited an hour to get in. The team was tied on @NUM2 and @NUM2, that was @DATE1, and we still won. The coach had an injured player, so he let me in. If I didn't have the patience, I wouldn't win the game because the coach wouldn't let me know that's when I had the patience.
Once I was patient and when I went to get my hair cut she told me to come at @TIME1. But when I get there at @TIME1, she has @NUM1 people ahead of her, but I don't care because I don't have to do nothing after that. So I just sit there patiently and my best friend is with me so I don't get bored and we just sit there chatting and texting our boyfriends. Then the lady who was going to cut my hair came to me and said I'm sorry but I told you the wrong time and I said oh it's okay I can wait. When she finished their hair, the ladies came to me and said they were sorry. So she leaves @NUM2 people behind and when she's done she'll move on like @NUM3 - @NUM4. That's when I'm patient.
For me, patience is one of the most important qualities of a person. It is very important to be patient with someone. It can make you a friend, it can make you a girl or a boyfriend, it can make you the best things in life. Once, a patient gave me a current hockey stick. About a month ago I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the rink I was playing. "Do you have @CAPS1 @PERSON1 Steam @NUM1?" I asked wondering if it was easy to get it. "@CAPS2 man, we just ran out." The @CAPS3 salesperson gave me a shrug. I know if I want that stick. I will have to search harder. When I got home, I checked the internet to see if any nearby stores had stock. No luck. I think I have to order online. I wonder. Delivery did not come quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks to arrive. All the time and effort is worth it.
I have patience until the @DATE1 holiday comes. I'll try to be my best at school until @DATE1 arrives. @CAPS1 Example, I took @NUM1 honorary charges last year. After @DATE1, if I have to reciprocate or @DATE1 patients, then I will and I will not leave @CAPS1 at the last minute. Then, I'll wait until school reopens, which will be a new year. I will also wait until @DATE1 again. But we have some breaks and days off during this period and I think we still have enough homework over the years to start our school @NUM2 days a week. Sometimes school is really fun, @CAPS1 example, I wait until field trips and school events. But we have to be careful so the principal doesn't deprive us of our privileges, @CAPS1 example, she deprives us if we behave badly or if we are detained too much. That means all my patience will be @CAPS1. It's really not fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones who cause trouble.
For a while I was patient, it doesn't happen once and it happens all the time. The time I have patience is when my mom is talking or getting her hair done at the hair salon. Today I'm going to talk about when she goes shopping. When my mom went shopping, she brought all the women in my family, my cousins, aunts and grandmothers. I either go to the mall with them, stay in the car, or stay at home. I'll talk to them about when to go to the mall. They shop for a minimum of eight hours and a maximum of ten. They just stop by not going to one mall, they go to at least two malls, three at most. They also go to a lot of malls just for simple fashion and rainbow stuff. They were going to a hundred places for at least eight hours, my feet started hurting, I was hungry and tired, but, I didn't complain because I was patient. Now we're in a mall and I go to carry bags and go to a lot of women's clothing stores like Victoria @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. Then shop for jewelry, cosmetics, fragrances and all the world-renowned women's products. Plus, I got lost because they left me. In short, I was very patient with my mother no matter what.
I write when I am patient. I had to be patient because I was going to a party, but I didn't, I got angry, I couldn't be patient. In me also impatient people. They just couldn't wait. They really couldn't wait, but I waited, waited, waited, and I was pissed, and I couldn't even wait any longer. I was actually waiting for my aunt to pick me up and she didn't have @CAPS1 I called my mom and she said she was taking me to the party I was patient and she didn't come @CAPS1 I didn't don't go to the party I was very anger. Because my mom didn't come to pick me up, @CAPS1 I called my grandma and she came in to pick me up. That was the only time I patiently studied.
Be patient when traveling. I was patient last time @DATE1 went to ???PA. I have to wait patiently for @NUM1 hours before my family and I arrive. I had to be more patient the next day as we went to an interesting park. There I had to stand in a long queue, '@CAPS1 it's really hard to be patient. @CAPS1 It's hard to get you to be patient. This is the story of when I was patient.
The clock tells me it's about three @CAPS1 clocks, but I can't sleep because my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I'm going fishing. So it's eight @CAPS1'clock my @CAPS2 should be here at seven but my grandma keeps saying he'll be here so I trust her but I'm a little worried. It's ten o'clock @CAPS1' clock knows. I was so pissed I was about to cry but my grandma said he'd be here and I said, "@CAPS4 he won't come into my room and then I realized he'd be here he'd be here. Then I heard the door open I ran in and it was him I ran in and said you came in last and we ate and then I looked out and saw the boat. That's when I should have been patient.
I remember the one time I was at @CAPS1 when I was at home was the first to get up at Christmas and I just wanted to open all my presents and presents but I had to wait until everyone was down the stairs for @CAPS2 mom to get it Cameras @CAPS2 We open gifts My siblings What's first? The oldest went first to the rules my brother made, and finally it was my turn when I was @CAPS1.
Patient to me means doing your best to wait for someone or something. I remember one time I was very patient. I went to the water park with my @ORGANIZATION1 and we wanted to get on this water slide and there was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited for @NUM1 and we ended up in second place. The kids in front of us offered to stand in front of them, but we declined. So we were waiting for the lifeguard to tell the boy to hold on because it was his first time sliding down a waterslide. But what the little boy fell from the tube hit his head and most of the people drowned because he couldn't swim. It was horrible but we went anyway and had a great time.
Crackling! I was in the seat when the rented car hit another pothole @CAPS1 "Looks like he's awake so my mom is as annoying as possible." You sleep long because he'll probably sleep until school and come back . "@CAPS2 Are we?" asked in a dull voice. "ohio" replied to my mom's friend @PERSON1. We're going to @LOCATION1 over spring break with my mom @PERSON1 and me @CAPS3 @PERSON2. We will live in gorgeous @CAPS4. While we're there, we'll visit my dad as he works at @CAPS4. It will be an unforgettable trip for me, but I know the car tour there will be the ultimate test of my patience. We need @NUM1 or @NUM2 days to reach our destination. @NUM3 days will be the hardest. This was the day we drove him through the mountains. I can usually pass the time when I'm riding in a corner, ? ? @CAPS5 ??. However, when we got to the top of @NUM3 mountain, everything got busy. First, my @CAPS3 (sitting next to me) started screaming because there weren't any guardrails and we were in the driveway near the edge. Second, my @CAPS3 started grabbing my arm like her life. Finally, and worst of all, my bladder started to rise! All of which made for an enjoyable ride through the mountains, a roller coaster ride that I will never forget. I keep thinking about myself. "I'm going crazy! Make it stop. As if to suggest, the screaming stopped, the pressure on my @CAPS3 grabbing my arm lessened and we stopped at a rest stop with a bathroom. I'm going to be insane with no patience. I'll be sitting in all the mental hospitals. I'll always remember that journey across the mountain.
Today is my first day of patience. I can not believe it. I am proud of myself. I am so patient. I was in line for ice cream and this teenage girl walked up to the counter and said "@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes and if you don't make the line move then I'm going to have to talk to the waiter. All Everyone said: "I'm sorry, but you just have to wait until everyone in front of you gets there, and you're not going to get there". "@CAPS2 Are you kidding me? ' she stopped and yelled, and that's when I knew how ridiculous I looked in the hospital, so I waited in line until I got up to the counter, and I said, "Got to deal with a lot of people like this, because you deal with it very calmly." " He said yes, there are a lot of people like this around and it's really sad. So @CAPS2 do you want to order?" I told him my order and walked home and when I walked home I was very proud , I will never be hospitalized again.
My time of patience is waiting for my gymnastics competition to start. I had to wait two hours with my team. We warm up and stretch and talk about who we think will win the team trophy. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said there was an hour left. So, we chatted a little more and practiced some floor skills. We did handstands and did what we could to kill time. After half an hour we asked our coach again and he told us it would be another half hour because they had to call in another judge. Finally an hour later, the judge got them, the coaches had a meeting, and we got up? ? meeting. That's when I'm patient.
I'll write when I'm patient. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone and she said if I was patient I could get a phone so I was patient. Time flies, family, she was heartbroken, yes I got one when I patiently got one. Are you patient with your family? Tell me, if you are, if it has an impact on your family, it might work for you. This is what happens when you have patience.
"@CAPS1! Is it coming!?" I yelled, rushing home from the bus stop. She stood in the letterbox with a thick stack of envelopes in her hand. I hope it is one of the letters. "@CAPS2 still darling," she said, "but there are bills to pay." I wanted to scream angrily, but I remember what @CAPS3 said, "Just wait long enough and you'll get what you want "Yes", I dragged my legs in, and threw myself on the sofa with a thud. This letter means a lot to me. It says which advanced courses I will take. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but only the elite can get in, which means the world to me. I'll be challenged, my parents will be proud of me, and I'll get @NUM1 dollars from my grandma. Look, you took the test at the end of school and waited for the results throughout @DATE1. Pretty good system, right? No! Soon, other things like swimming competitions, tennis, books, etc. distracted me, and I learned that being patient was helpful and that time passed faster. @CAPS3 I guess right. A @DATE2 @TIME1, on @DATE1 I was reading on the porch. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the postman. He tossed in his bag, took out the mail, put it in our mailbox, and drove away. I jumped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I skimmed through the mail until an envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it said that @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced courses: @CAPS4 LEARNING @CAPS5 @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off!
My patient time was the time I was @NUM1 on @DATE1 it was a snowy night my mom and dad bought a new car and it took a long time I was hungry mom and dad were working with the car dealership My siblings were playing @CAPS1 and when my parents finished talking to the car dealer they looked at the car they wanted and one of the workers brought me and my siblings a box of cookies and milk, While my parents were watching the cookies we were hungry again, but I showed patience. My mom and dad found the car they wanted, they chose a van with @CAPS2, they paid, and we left, my dad took us to @ORGANIZATION1.
I'm always the patient person until I sit for hours before I can oh patient person. My mom is also very patient, especially the way she works. Many of us were rude to her.
Just one day a few months ago, my brother and my mom were in line to write school supplies. We are number @NUM1, they just call @NUM2. It's near @PERCENT1 and we had to stand there. The new battery I just put in @NUM3 is dead. Took areand@NUM4 hours to get in. And then there are more lines! We barely got anything that day, but because of our patience, we did.
I don't know where we are. Then my dad told me we were in this place called buddies. I didn't get there until that day. The waitress then seated us at a round table. Then she asked if we wanted something to drink. I told our waitress I wanted a diet Pepsi. My sister drank juice. as always. My mom and dad got Mountain Dew. My brother ate Cherry Pepsi. I don't know why we all had different drinks. However, it took us @NUM1 minutes to get our drinks. My dad is not so patient. He knew that food would last forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for waiting. Then she took our order. The wait is @NUM2 minutes. My dad is very impatient. I was the only patient at our table. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. I told my dad to be patient, the food would come out quickly. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, and left. That's when I'm patient.
I'm going to write one when I have the patience. My family and I were putting up decorations for my @NUM1 @CAPS2 the other day. I am very excited and nervous. I'm almost ten, so it's important to me. We all had our cake ready, decorated with beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also has a photo of a horse running @CAPS4 and "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3". @CAPS4 it. The party starts at NUM2 am. I was wearing a pretty pink floral dress with streamers. I keep asking @CAPS4 what time it is and my mom just says be patient. I have to wait. I am a very impatient girl. I'm so excited, I can't wait. Then I remembered that I should be patient, so I did. I play games and read books while waiting for guests. Then before I knew it, the doorbell rang and my family ran in with gifts and curds. I think all the waiting really paid off. I also got some really cool gifts.
Every day at school I have to patiently get my food like pizza, for sale, sand with milk, it's always been bad, but I'll check my milk. I had to be patient to get the gun.
Little Elkhorn High School, @DATE1, @PERSON1 colbonthorne had a dull day, he hated school so much, he just wanted to go home, @CAPS1 his teacher told him to sit down, shut up, do his thing work, so he wants to kill time by flicking to erase the toy on the blackboard. After about sixty erasers, he looked at the clock, which read @TIME1. He complained to the teacher and she said ''. @PERSON1, if you're impatient, I'll send you home! ''@PERSON1 exclaimed, ''@CAPS2 @PERSON1, detained after school'' so @PERSON1 was afraid of being detained and sat down to do his work, all day, no complaints ''finally''. The teacher said to be @ORGANIZATION1.
I'm waiting. I'm looking forward to watching the silent audience. However, due to the stage lights shining on me, I really couldn't see very well. I stand next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage are our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I keep staring ahead, I wonder how I got here and why I'm here. I stared out the window of the small classroom, @PERSON1 was talking all the time. She said there was a game for the entire seventh grade. We need to pair up and write a story about whatever we want. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and were shocked, yes. Later that day, I rode my bike to @CAPS3's house, thinking about what to write about. @PERSON1 also said that whoever wins will get to enter more writing contests. Because I love writing and competing, I almost jump for excitement. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already yelling. Finally we decided to write something. It will be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the jungle. In the end, we wrote ten pages. I typed ten pages on my Acer. After all spell checking and grammar checking, we printed our story and turned it in. Results are between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me at the end of the day. So our piece was handed over to the state for another competition, and I was paired with @PERSON2 and my pairing won again! I really hope we don't tie in the national game. So here, I'm still on stage staring at the audience, and they're all thinking about how I got here. I'm tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patience, so I did. After 20 minutes of judging, the chairman stepped forward and said that @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 had won the first place. We jumped up and down and got on the trophy. @CAPS1, we've found that hard work and patience can really lead to great things.
A @CAPS1 I'm patiently waiting for the game to arrive. I waited for @NUM1 years and then @CAPS1 Finele came and I started using @CAPS1 like any other. @CAPS8 @CAPS1 just keep @CAPS4 on so @CAPS5 when I @CAPS6 @CAPS7 I just sit on the front porch and the rest of @CAPS1 @CAPS8 never shows up so I just go to @CAPS9. Next @CAPS1 I'm coming @CAPS7 I checked the mail @CAPS11 it was empty so I swooped on the coach and watched the TV I looked ahead @CAPS12 and it's a package just @CAPS13 it's my game, That's my patient's story.
Once I entered the @CAPS1 wing competition and was waiting to buy a ticket. Very long and boring. There were a lot of people in line for that game. Even though I just wanted to go in line to buy tickets, I didn't because that would be misleading. I feel this helps me develop my patients more. Also, I don't want people jumping in line in front of me. I learned that good things happen to those who wait.
Once I was so patient, I sat at home for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up to pick up my friends. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you can go further and wait for what you want.
I have patience many times. Maybe it's like waiting for a doctor's appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you can finish your homework. Maybe wait a few days for your teacher to stop instructing so you can finish your homework. @MONTH1 Wait a few days for your teacher to come and give your test. But today I'm going to talk about when I had to be patient to get my first dog. @CAPS1 was when we went looking for a dog to adopt last year. We couldn't find a suitable one. It took @CAPS1 @NUM1 weeks until we saw the cutest chichuacua. He is only one year old. We scrambled through the papers, fearful that someone else was planning to adopt him. When we opened @CAPS1 the lady said we have the back too. After finishing the paperwork, we had to wait another week because they had to fix him. My mom went shopping at the dog store and they told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We are very excited. Instead of @DATE2, we thought we could pick him up at @DATE1. On that day @DATE1 we picked him up @CAPS1 spent @NUM2 years being patient for my sister and I only spent @NUM3 years. After a year, we went back for adoption or just looking for another dog. We didn't find it, but we waited, and if you're a patient, you'll get something. We still have the patience to get another dog if our parents allow @CAPS1.
I was very patient at school a lot of the time. How long do I wait when I don't understand something and my teacher or someone else is busy. I need to help others until they are alone. In any of my classes, I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was a little behind because I had finished a project that was due the week before so when I started making my box I did my best with a demonstration from the art teacher . That's the beginning of it. So when I needed help, I asked a friend who was done if they would help me catch up and they said yes, so I got help from them. when others seek help. So when she helps. I cried and it took about a full hour, but, I cried and was patient with them. At the end of the hour, they were still not done, so she said she would help me in the next few days. I said ok and then I said, I'll see them the next day. Art @PERSON1 helped me the next day, when she was resting or doing her own thing, I did my best and patiently waited for her to help me again. @PERSON1 is almost done with her present but I'm still waiting so I've asked the others until she's done her project. Finally, when she was done, she helped me with the rest of my son. At the end of an hour, I finished it. Then we started a simple new project the next day. It's not the only time, but it's the longest time I've been patient with someone.
I can't really tell you when I'm patient because no matter how hard I try to be patient, I struggle, which seems impossible, but it's not, maybe. I just didn't try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatient I am I'll turn around and probably buy candy. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can't spend it, but I always end up finding it and spending it because it doesn't want to do that until they happen most of the time give it back to me. I was grounded but it was worth the money because I got candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom says no, I'm always sneaking around and getting into trouble. @NUM1 words.
Patience is being able to wait for something. Patience is hard for some, easy for others. For me, I can be patient. Like I was patient with this game I pre-ordered. It came out @DATE1. When I'm impatient is when I want to get on the computer. I also got my second rank with patience and that's all I have to say about patience.
When I'm patient is when I get my injections. Just me and my dad. Because I was sick, I had to go for an injection. It was still cold outside as it was on @DATE1. We went to the children of @ORGANIZATION1. In the beginning, I was at home ready to go. I put on an orange turtleneck and jeans and sneakers. I don't want to go because that's after @CAPS1 and I have a lot of new games. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information and we sat down. In the middle, we started watching TV. I'm really bored because it's just informal. They made us wait over an hour. I started to feel hungry and very depressed. They finally called our names. Finally it was time for me to shoot. The pretty lady gave me a glass of juice. Then she told me I got @NUM2 photos. My shots took a long time, I was frustrated, I shot, and before we left, they told me I would come back and shoot more. I'm still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds. All in all, I was very patient when shooting. The information I got was just as painful as my footage. They made us wait a long time. I'm sad to have to wait, but glad it's over.
When I go to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 I have experienced patients. It's a @NUM1 hour away, we're in a car, we're a little sleepy because we didn't sleep well last night, and even though I brought a book and my @ORGANIZATION1 game, we're still bored. After my @ORGANIZATION1 battery died, all I did was look at the trees. Dad was put on the road and Mom finally went to see the Traveler with the license plate. Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started falling asleep but @CAPS1 kept me awake because she just finished her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you can hear it, mom, @CAPS1 and my stomach growl, we don't stop. We must be at @LOCATION1 by @NUM2 pm as that is when the hotel reception closes. At @NUM3 we were going through the state of @LOCATION1 and then arriving at the hotel at @TIME1, we were so excited that we fell asleep within @NUM4 minutes in bed.
Patience, what does it mean? Stands for; "You are understanding and tolerant. A patient person will encounter difficulties without complaining." @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. At one point, I had a hard time being a patient person, but I didn't complain. I am so excited to go to the water park on my birthday. I want to party and keep swimming, but it's almost week NUM1. I don't want to wait any longer, but I know patience will make my experience better. I am tolerant, understanding and patient. Drag off for a week. I want to complain and rip my hair out because it's like the earth is turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times, but I know I can't! The problem was clear when the idea of going to a water park stuck in my head like glue. If I don't think about it, time will fly by again. I have to be patient because I don't want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When that day came, I was taken aback. Patience is always good!
patience. Patience is good and bad. I have good things happen to me. I @CAPS1 I have to be patient. Here are some good things that happened to me. The time I had the patience was when trying out dance teams at my dance studio. I was so nervous and had never tried anything before. I had to wait & wait & wait for my dance studio to call my mom. One day, while I was at a friend's house, my mom called me and said, "@CAPS2, you've made a dance team." I was so happy. I can't wait to learn a new dance. Then I can see everyone in my dance competition. It will be very interesting. Another time I was patient was when I broke my arm. I have to be patient. I have to be very careful with my arms. I put it in the cast and I waited to take it off. Now I don't have a cast. I'm patient and the doctor says it's healing and I don't need a cast anymore. Better things will come if you are patient.
Once I went to the @CAPS1 world and we waited about @NUM1 hours to start this stupid rudeness. I'm them because I have my @ORGANIZATION1, so I played that one, but after an hour of playing I got bored. I provoke my sisters just by watching them get angry. Then I got bored with it, so I just sat on the road.
In my own words, patience is when you have to stay calm and quiet. Not all super and annoying. Patience is just controlling yourself. And don't be rude and disrespectful to others.
One day, I was at my sister's football game. My mom dropped us off at the game because she had to go to work. When I got out of the car, she asked if I had my money with me. I said no and then she said you'd just be hungry. I say @CAPS1. @CAPS2 When the game starts. I am really hungry. @CAPS2 I checked all my packets, just @CAPS2 I happened to find @NUM1 bucks. @CAPS2 I'll go and see how long the line is. This is @CAPS2 long it's almost down the street. @CAPS2 I sat down and tried to make the line shorter. But the line has gotten longer @CAPS2 I ran on this line. I had to queue for about @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS2 When I finally got off the line, I stood at the door watching my sister cheer. @CAPS2 She came to us and asked me to say goodbye to her for some @CAPS3 chips. I said no because the line was too long. @CAPS2 She said please! @CAPS2 I requeued and it moved slower. When I came back, she said, how much of your time @CAPS2 took. I say watch the line. @CAPS2 That was one of those times when I was patient.
I think patience is like someone or someone is waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom and then another person can go to the bathroom. It's like I'm impatient because I want to go to the store now but they said please be patient. My whole family is impatient, but my friends have.
I was in @LOCATION1's car when I had the patience. It's a 1 hour drive from @DATE, but I'm being patient, I'm not complaining. Most kids would say we're still there, but I'm not. Plus, when I was hungry for dinner, I sat there and didn't complain. Finally @DATE1 we got there. That's when I have patience.
The other day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1. We got there on this big speedboat called the Jet Express. So we had to wait on the big line. The boat was late so we were told we would be late. I know I'm not dressed warm and it's cold. We were the first in line so it was a good thing but I was patient and I didn't complain or anything. When the boat finally arrived, I was relieved and my mom thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun.
When my friend got his medicine, I waited until he was ready and I sat down and waited for him. I'm putting down my phone @PERSON2 ping pong and uplift loudly. I'm looking for @PERSON1 and I'm waiting for him to finish.
One day @DATE1, my uncle took me to @CAPS1 to hit the wheel @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The line was long and we waited at least @NUM1 hours. Time passed slowly and we finally got in the car. After that, we went to the @CAPS5 thrilling @CAPS6 which took about an hour and a half.
patience. "@CAPS1" @CAPS4 growling stomach. "@CAPS2 I'm hungry" I cried so @CAPS12 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2 as @CAPS8 was on our way home. Moments later, @CAPS8 finally pulled into @ORGANIZATION2's lane. Cashier said: "Hi @MONTH1, I'm holding your @CAPS3." @CAPS4 @CAPS2 shouting "@CAPS5 I got a famous bowl and a @NUM1 piece of honey @CAPS6 wings." Lady @CAPS7 "@ MONEY2 @NUM2 first window." @CAPS8 drove to first window @CAPS4 @CAPS2 deposited a bill for the lady @MONEY1, @CAPS12 gave her @MONEY3 and said "@MONEY3 is your change, go 2nd window." @CAPS9 @CAPS8 can drive to 2nd window @CAPS8 had to wait in the car in front of us. @CAPS8 sat there for @MONEY for 1 min and they finally left. Then @CAPS8 drove to the second window and waited. @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 is still waiting. So after 1 minute @MONEY. I said "@CAPS2 @CAPS5 @CAPS8 go get some @ORGANIZATION1" @CAPS12 Calm @CAPS7 "@CAPS10, @CAPS8 will be patiently sitting here." I muttered, "But I'm starving." @CAPS8 Sitting there patiently for over an hour. I asked again "@CAPS5 @CAPS8 please leave." @CAPS12 said "@CAPS10, I paid for the food, I'm going to pick it up." @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 finally got the food two hours later. @CAPS8 got some free food after sitting there. Even though @CAPS8 got some free food, I'm still pissed @CAPS8 has been sitting there.
It's been a hot @DATE1 day and I decided to ride my dirt bike @CAPS1 but I'm wearing helmet, boots, goggles and gloves. I walked out the door, walked to my SUV, started it and took off. Like a speeding "zoom", I went up a ramp and landed, but I was about to quickly round a corner, "wam" I fell and my foot went into my leg. My dad ran over to pick me up and put me on the truck @CAPS2. When we arrived, my dad had to check in after we were seated. There were many people there, men, women, children and babies. An hour passed and we were still sitting there, then another two hours passed and they finally called my name. The nurse took my dad and I to a room and said "the doctor will be here soon". "Okay" my dad replied. An hour passed without a doctor. We were starting to be strangers to @CAPS1 and my dad turned on the TV. Then the last three hours after we entered the room, the doctor came in, it's now @NUM1 pm and we are exostid. When we came back, the doctor took me for an x-ray, and the doctor said I had broken my bone and shattered it and said to stay away from it for a week. When I got home, I lay lounging on the sofa and fell straight to sleep. That's my six hours of patient waiting in @CAPS2.
The one time I was patient was when I was waiting for a basketball game I played for the Destroyer. So in all games I always have to wait until @DATE2. So in the @DATE1 race this season, I made four. In the first @DATE2, I was about a minute in. I attended @NUM1 minutes on @DATE1. I'm happy, but I haven't started yet. Then we got into the play-offs and I only played two minutes the whole game. One time I was going to quit, but my teammates came up to me and said don't worry you will, everyone will when you start. For the next few months, I patiently waited. Then we went to the tournament and we split the team, one senior and the other young. And then I finally got into the starting lineup. I was excited, I made the playoffs and then we lost in the championship game. That's when I have patience.
Patients help you through life. If you're impatient, you won't know where to go next. @CAPS4 Uncle has to be patient with the month. He was just calling at @CAPS5. Finally someone shouted, be patient, they'll call. He told us that patience was the hardest thing for him to do. He ate, why can't they call the next day. Here and there will eventually be forgotten, he said. He said he tried to be patient. @CAPS4 is waiting for a patient? ? ? America's next @CAPS1 @CAPS2. They added him and if he got them they would call. They did it quickly because of the cell phone cups. A woman said nicely "@MONTH1 I'm talking with @CAPS3 Sanders please" @CAPS4 Uncle replied "Yep, it's him! I'm @CAPS5 for a month! The @CAPS4 family keeps telling me to be patient! So now I don't No more!" "You're in! Keep practicing! Someone will call you for details!" "@CAPS6 You're awesome!" Then he hangs up "I'm here!" @CAPS7 is the happiest of our lives day. Uncle @CAPS4 has been through a lot. What really got him on the ground was his patience. He told us that @CAPS7 is hard, but @CAPS7 works well and ends well. Here are future suggestions. Always and I mean always be patient. You won't get anywhere in your life if you're not. Patients are important in your life @CAPS8.
When I am patient is when I count. I didn't just count to ten, I counted a whole bunch of coins, including pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to count my money and it felt like an eternity. Counting a bunch of coins won't change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to do it. I still remember the moment I finished counting the money. I'm proud of myself, but I don't think I can because I admit to being a very impatient person. Patience is important because without it, nothing will be accomplished. I don't think I can count my coins anymore, but like they say, "Patience is a virtue."
Sitting in the car and waiting for @CAPS2 mom to come out and get in the car. When she got in the car, we left. On the way? ? ? For the @CAPS1 party, I was bored after about a few minutes, and when I left Midland I thought it would pass quickly, but I was wrong, it was slower than ever. I'm sick of the idea of @CAPS2, things are even worse with @CAPS2's little sisters screaming in the back. So we stopped at the gas station and the witch felt like forever. I almost never talk all the way, I've been trying to be patient, but I can't take it. After the girls screamed for about an hour, I finally calmed myself down. They finally fell asleep. I'm just sitting there looking out the window, and when we're about forty-five minutes away, it feels like we've been driving for days. When the girls finally woke up, it was about @NUM1 minutes later. They started screaming "Are we there yet" @CAPS2 Mom and Dad kept saying "@CAPS3" When we pulled into the driveway it was probably the happiest thing that happened hat day. I thought I was patient on the way there, but I might sleep on the way back. I was patient at the party until we could open the presents. I was terrified. I hope this doesn't happen next time.
It's hard to be patient. First of all it's like you're waiting? ? ? A line that may take forever. It can take a long time to be patient on this line, but if you have something to do, it might pass quickly. You can bring a book to read and read, or be patient and read.
Once, when I had the patience, I got to a place I always liked to go. This place is called @CAPS1 Point. I've been looking forward to this place and will be super excited once we get there. A small disappointment with this place is called the wait. Another word is patience. Patience is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere @CAPS1 points, like on the way there, finding a campsite, and queuing. But in the end, it's all worth it because patience is followed by a lot of fun
I remember when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 I saw a very patient little girl. When I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time to @ORGANIZATION1. It's so colorful and loud. I rode a few times and got hungry so my family and I went to get some marshmallows. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in a row like a little horn. Suddenly, I saw a group of teenagers standing right in front of the little girl. She was very patient, she just stood behind the teenagers who stood in front of her. In just a few minutes, the line grew longer. I left to ride some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people stood in front of her, but she didn't say anything. All she did was talk to herself. I can not stand it any more! I wonder how she can get them cut like this. If I were that little girl, I'd lose my patience before @CAPS1 @CAPS1. I'm amazed how patient she is. She's finally at the front of the line, @CAPS3! The closed sign came out. I couldn't believe my eyes, she wasn't even angry. I've been to the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 booths and did the same! I can't watch this anymore. I left with my family thinking about that girl. In the end I hope to have a lot of patience like her, just thinking about her amazes me!
I know when I have patience. My friend @PERSON1 is back on the football field after we got a grant from @NUM1. We're going to go out and play. It took two and a half hours before he got theirs. While he was there, we all patiently played games or did what other people wanted to do. Over time, the sun acts like a tanning shed. The grass is also dry like a cactus, but the days go on. In the end we went our own way. We know we have patience.
Once, while I was patiently waiting, my friend @PERSON1 went to the mall around @NUM1. @CAPS2 should go get a new uniform. When @CAPS2 got there, the sun was really bright in the sky, the birds were chirping, and it was as hot as a day on @DATE1. When the two of @CAPS2 were walking, there was hardly anyone there, but @CAPS2 went to a shop called ??? and it was packed, I thought I was listening to a concert. @CAPS2 Had to queue the longest, it was so long and people were almost at the door. So @CAPS2 waited and waited. Finally @CAPS2 was at the top of the line and the cashier said, "@CAPS1, you were in line for about @NUM2 hours. I'll give you a @PERCENT1 discount." @CAPS2 went shopping, @CAPS2 for patience Earn rewards.
When I go to @CAPS1 o'clock, the time I have patience is the last @DATE1. I was about to line up to ride @CAPS2. I was in line begging and then I saw the sign @CAPS3 was waiting for two hours from then on. But I'm not very close to the sign, so for me and my family and others who are in the same place as us, we may have to wait at least two and a half hours. Well, it's a hot day and I'm wearing black, which may not be the smartest @CAPS4. So I was in line for about an hour and it was just that I couldn't stand standing in that hot wheat anymore but I really wanted to catch that rope so all I could do was wait another hour and get Patent and then I was about to ride @NUM1 minutes away and then the line seemed to leave me for a good reason, I was in front and I'm glad I was patient enough to wait that long. That's a line I'm very patient with.
On @CAPS1's day, I had to sit for two hours because I had to come and remove the stitches. And a lot of people, we were there for a long time because there were only @NUM1 doctors and this lady took a long time. So it's my turn to go in, but I'm heartbroken, if hurt, but he's doing it, and it's not in vain. Then I went home.
Not long ago, my best friend @PERSON1's grandpa passed away. They are not related by blood, but they are very close. At the funeral, I saw @PERSON1, her sister @CAPS1 forced a laugh at us. @CAPS1 Leave to talk to my parents. Then, @PERSON1 starts crying, she won't see her grandpa's gravestone because they're moving to @LOCATION1. She changed the subject and recounted the good times she had with her grandpa. I smiled at @PERSON1. My parents later said we had to go to church. I hugged her and told her everything would be fine. She smiled, "A lot of the opposite." Tears welled up in @PERSON1's eyes, "I don't want to move to @LOCATION1." @CAPS2 weeks later, she did with her family.
I say your patient is. When you're in line for something, your patients are patience. Waiting for your turn is about being patient, once I was on the bench patiently waiting to play but couldn't play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 but you know what I did with patience. A lot of people are patient, but some are just rude when they don't care and start yelling. Like pop stars, a lot of singers pop stars and other celebrities think they can cut their fortunes in front of anyone, but they're not rich they'll cut pop stars and movie stars just need to be patient. Not that all pop stars and movie stars were impatient when they were little, they never did.
When my mom goes to the store, I'm patient, she'll go to the store and get a basket, she'll be in that store all day, she'll come out of that store, and the basket is full of baskets, and I'll be patient and then she'll go to a new one The store does it again
Onece, when my family goes to @LOCATION1, we all have to be patient. There is a water ride where you can sit in the log and go up the hill. You wait until you reach the top, and then you splash down the mountain. Well, that was one of everyone's favorite rides, so there was a long queue. We had to wait an hour and a half for a ride. So, in order to do something, it takes time, so you have to be patient. If you are impatient, you may want to do what you want.
Patience is the ability to tolerate, understand, and face difficulties without complaining. Patience is not something they teach you at my school. There is no book called Patience @NUM1 and no movie called Patience is the key. None of this exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a phone is a gun. I've just been assigned my first undercover assignment and it's not at all what I expected. So far, all I've done is sit on the cold bench next to the power meter at the county fair. What people really don't understand is the patience of being a spy. Of course an occasional car was blown up, the stakes weren't today, not for me. I have the clock in my hand, so 'tick, tick, tick, tick'. @CAPS3 @CAPS2, here comes the action. The subject (who I was assigned to watch was moving, oh never mind, all the subject did was a three dollar bag of popcorn. I started scribbling a design on the dirt with my feet. I was about to abort the mission. Seeing nothing As it happened I suddenly found a clue. Right in front of me in the dirt. I saw a tiny computer chip. I picked it up and sprayed the print out with my fingers. A purple fluffy cloud of steam surrounded the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud disappeared. I saw the subject's fingerprint on the chip, I pulled out the laptop while plugging in the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 is the word that stayed on the computer screen and didn't seem to go I sat there Waiting bored I remember being patient I thought to myself if I could beat a dozen armed robbers with a tablecloth I would definitely be able to sit here, be patient. Twenty minutes have passed now, but I feel like twenty hours. Computer Also on the screen it said, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 made it. "@CAPS2!" I exclaimed and people started staring, but I didn't mind. I clicked on the square on the screen that said "Open". @CAPS3 opens a small message that says "@CAPS4 I'm at an ice cream shop." I close my laptop and start walking slowly towards the ice cream truck, observing everyone and everything around me. The only ones standing by the ice cream stand are A man in a yellow shirt and a woman in a purple scarf. I got closer and I realized that the man had a gun. I took out mine, and with a few loud roars, they were both in handcuffs, they All working with prime suspects. Without patience, I will never be able to successfully complete my mission.
I remember one time I was very patient. I was patient and the doctor gave me a sucker. I was patient as the doctor was looking for a needle to stick into my arm. He told me to wait, but instead of a second, I waited for hours. Mom can't wait to take me home. I told her to be patient, time would pass faster. She said she would try, but if it didn't work, she would leave. She waited patiently and the next thing you know the doctor goes back to the room and thank you for your patience. He was still looking for the needle, then he went back to the room and said I found it. It was in another doctor's room above the vanity sink and after my injection the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and didn't leave. After he thanked me, he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. I went out with my mom and went to the store to buy something to eat.
So you want a story about being patient. So the story starts with me in the doctor's office, so I'm waiting. I'm going to sit here for hours so @NUM1 @CAPS1 I'll read something. So I'm reading and everything I'm here is screaming, so me? ? Ono yes. But not angry. I got the baby to stop crying and the mom to stop screaming, so I'm happy. My sister cheris showed up and screamed in my ear and I was really pissed off but not pissed off so I got another one? ? ? Then my mom said another hour. I was so angry, I screamed. It's true, I'm patient
I was patient when whey went to lunch, I was putting up with their patients, we had lunch, and avir @CAPS1 was patient, then we had lunch, and I didn't once my fraed was patient because we were in water fouten get some water, some grey cam to water fauten get some water. He waters the sick.
Without patience, one can easily be broken. There is no patience, one can easily be triggered by terrible things like me I have patience but sometimes I am impatient sometimes. Without patience, the whole world will get so out of hand that most business plans try to hate there? ? ? First as possible. So it's all about patience.
When I'm patient, I remember writing an article at SeaWorld when I was very young. I didn't complain because I know sometimes my sister will complain that I get those because she's in a bad mood. We queued for @NUM1 minutes for a character named @CAPS1 drop or something like that I don't remember. Then there is a line in? ? ? for? ? ? . We waited @NUM2 minutes plus the time everyone came out.
Once I had to wait patiently for a plane to come in. We got up at dawn and had to work @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours. When did my family and I get to @LOCATION1 while off at @DATE1 a few years ago. We did a lot of thinking while we were there. When we had to go home, we had to fight for the plains. We got up early so we could pack our bags and head to the airport. When we got there we had to wait patiently for us to re-rent the car and go through sicuritey. We had to arrive for the plains when we got the throw safe. We sat for over an hour before the plain came in. When the plains arrived, we had to clear the plains, pass inspection, and everyone was bored. That's when I had to endure. I waited patiently for a long time.
Not long ago, when I was traveling to Cedar Point in @LOCATION1, it took an hour and thirty to drive to @DATE1, the reason we went was because of my dad's work @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I've been out of the car? ? ? @NUM1, waiting for my suaisn family, I've been waiting until @DATE1 popped into the park and my dad pointed out the height limit (I'm only @NUM2 and "4.@NUM2" feet tall @CAPS2 I'm 'for most' Not high enough for a @CAPS4 ride, my dad sees me high enough for @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We walked around looking for a ride and more importantly he lined up. So we finally??? focus shifted from riding to lines on, my mouth almost had a "@CAPS7 luck to that ride" look, my dad looked at me instead of my sister "Where's mom and Will?" I pointed to the side the fare was of course covard. So we got in line Check in, at least @NUM4 degrees. We waited almost two hours and finally got to the front, we got our chairs, a bar came over us, I remember there was something that set a quarter on your lap and gravity Grabbed it. One minute @CAPS8 we dropped a quarter like a net not floating @C APS9! In that instant, a solid footing now and the ride is really not worth the wait now, but hey , I'm not a covard.
During @DATE1 my sister and I are going to gnate wolf loge with a cosin grace and an ancul rege. But then he had to resign because his plain was going to be late. Then he had to take his car back. Then we rented a car. Then we had to pick up my uncle @PERSON1 and we went down the road. Once, we were stopped by the police and the police gave us a speeding ticket. We're finally here and it's been the best two days of my life.
The story I'm going to tell you is the story of a boy who went fishing with his father and the boy was impatient. One day a boy went fishing with his father, they got there, but put the fish in the water and said their trip, the boy got impatient and got an amputation. He didn't find anything until he got home and his father came up to him and said, "If you find something while you're fishing, it's going to be killing instead of fishing." @CAPS1 They went out the next day because Boy is patient so he found left music i.e. @CAPS2 because he is patient. Well, look what happened to the boy he caught a fish at @CAPS2 as the patient remembers "all good things now are patience!"
My mom is in the hospital! My mom is in the hospital! She is undergoing life-threatening surgery. This is a story I used to have patience with. For two years, my mom wasn't feeling well. When she was "examined" by the doctor, it turned out she had a heart attack @NUM1 age of blocked arteries. So I had to wait for her to be "ready". It took two hours and it felt like forever! Then I saw her for five minutes and then she had to be taken to the operating room. The operation took five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school. I did my homework and read magizens. I am very worried about my mother. But then the doctor came in and said no one could see her all day! I had to wait patiently until the next day. That's when I had patients and it paid off.
There was a boy who wanted to go to the gym, so when he got there, he had to take his chance. But that's a strong basketball he wants. When he got dressed, the other boys came out first to catch the ball. Later when he came out, he saw that they had it. So when he came over, he got pissed and took it from them. After getting angry, he came over and gave it to them and said "I can wait". So when it was done he got it and he was very happy and proud that he finally got the basketball. When he got home, he told @CAPS1 mom she said she was happy because he was finally patient. He asked: "What's that?" @CAPS1 Mom said: "It's a thing when you're understanding and tolerant. The boy is happy because he used to always take things and now he can wait to take things to be happy. The boy is now living happily with his high school @CAPS1 mom.
Yesterday, I finished @CAPS1 in front of a lot of people and drew for the next @NUM1 minutes, which gave me patience. I've been patient this time because if it wasn't I could be very loud and disrupt my classmates. I started drawing or coloring like some people say, because instead of drawing smiley faces, I colored in boxes on math drawing paper to make a lime green and purple checkerboard. It took the whole time and I haven't finished it yet. I remember being patient during that time.
I had the patience to go to the doctor once because when I was very young, I was running around at the doctor with no care. I guess my mom didn't trust me this time, so she sat with me wherever I went. Mind you, there are girls around, so I was embarrassed and asked mom why are you following me and she replied because I didn't want you to run around. When I told her mom that I'm grown up now, I'm not old, I'm mature now. She said @CAPS1 go on, so I went over and sat next to some girls and talked to them. That's when we got up and started walking around talking. I felt a little tingling in my head and said "your mom is still following you so I turned around and she wasn't there. So we went to the snack bar and sat down to eat and I happened to look and my mom was sitting 3rd table far away from us. That was back to where we used to take the elevator and to my surprise she was ready. I was sitting in my mom's seat when I told the girl I would be back Next to say "Are you following me, she answered yes, I mean no. So I talked to her and we came to an understanding. Soon it was my turn to see the doctor. This is how my story ends.
I got paid on time when my brother was riding fast and he finally ran out of it and said now you can ride. Now I reply my cool,
Patience is when you are understanding and forgiving. Also someone who goes through hardships without complaining. The time I was patient was when my sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born before I could be a big sister. My little sister should be born at 20 seconds @DATE1. That day, my mom didn't even sweat. I thought she would be ready to get her bag (which she packed the night before) and get ready to have a baby. Of course I am. One week and two days later, my mother went into labor and was about to give birth to my little sister. I was patient with those nine days of waiting. My dad and brother waited patiently in the waiting room until the nurse came out and said we could come in. I almost cried when I saw my sister's face. I know I will love her and she will be as patient as I am.
I'm on the @LOCATION3 @CAPS1 Sea Cadet Team. By the time I loaded my stuff into the truck, I had waited the @NUM1 hour drive until I was in port @LOCATION2 for training. We drove a 5 person truck and we had @NUM2 people in it and I was the one stuck in the back. Some people have a boat in their sea bag and it's stable on my back I try not to complain about it, it took me all my patience to get halfway through until I had to move my boots in my bay I grabbed the inside of the bag There are boots and wisdom on the other side. When I think all is well @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 start sighing at very annoying songs, I don't think my patients can bear to stay in that torch with their sighs. Finally we are at port @LOCATION2. @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 stopped sighing, my patience finally persevered. But then came the cheats and they were @NUM3 people in @CAPS3 waiting to check I had a feeling my patience was going to explode and I was going crazy. But I didn't stay there patiently until it was my turn to check in, unfortunately the officer at the check-in counter was old and slow to understand what he was saying. I was finally checked and my patience survived! ! Then I found out that my friend's login was given to me by the bank. He can be annoying. " @CAPS4 boy, I thought, 'This is another test of my patience. My patience was tested with as Ride, clean lines, and the whole training session. But my patience was strong and I survived! ! !
@CAPS3 is about a @NUM1 hour drive from Liberty Hill and we just left home. Dad, mom, @CAPS1 and I are going to meet buddies, @CAPS3 will be a @NUM1 1/2 hour concert. When we parked in the parking lot, the guard pointed to an open parking spot for the jeep and we drove into @CAPS3. We went out to drink soda and eat sand because there was still an hour or so before the concert. After @NUM3 minutes or @NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a seat on the hill. Once we were seated, time stopped and I waited and waited until I thought @NUM5 minutes had passed. I expected buddy to be on stage anytime, but @CAPS2 never did. After @NUM6 minutes, I elbowed my dad and asked "@CAPS3 how long have we been sitting?" "About five minutes." @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I think so I tried again. "How long?" "Six now." @CAPS3 It wouldn't be surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but the noise was too loud. Minute after minute passed, and someone stepped onto the stage. "Show starts in @NUM7 minutes." @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 Heartbreaking. The wait is only half over. Finally after @NUM7 minutes of death and waiting, @CAPS2 takes the stage. @CAPS3 is the best sight in the world. @CAPS3 Worth the long, long wait, I prefer @CAPS3. We packed up and spent the rest of the night.
When I have the patience is in gymnastics. In gymnastics you have to have a variety of patience. Your mind and body have to be patient, sometimes you have to be patient with the coach, and your mind has to be patient when you want to do something but you can't. When you feel like you're ready to do a skill, your body has to be patient, but your brain is telling you to stop and be patient. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always there to help. So sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes until they can finally help you. Patience is a very important life skill that everyone needs to have.
When I was at Universal, I was waiting in a long line to get in the car, and I was very patient. It does take a while, but I never get angry or impatient. My dad and I were in line for this dragon roller coaster and we were very close to the next one before it started raining and lightning. A lot of people left, so we ended up at the top of the line. We waited another hour or two but it never stopped. We forgot my mom and brother, so we left. I have always been patient. We went to line up for one of the new rides they just got and the line was pretty long since it was new. We waited a while. We ended up getting in the car and we realized the wait was worth it so we went again.
I went to my first doctor when I was @NUM1 and it was very neurotic. I sat in the chair next to my mom, shaping, thinking, nonstop for @NUM2. I ran around and when I finally sat down, I said. "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! I can't stand anyone. So it went out the door when the nerves called you next." I was like, "That's not long, just @NUM3 and ½," @CAPS4 is just @ NUM4, we got here at @TIME1 "@CAPS5 not long," my mom said. Next time I go to the doctor, I will be extra patient.
Being patient means that you understand and tolerate a patient person having difficulties without complaining. I write when my friend @PERSON1 has patience. "@CAPS1" @PERSON1 said to @ORGANIZATION1 as he is going to spend his entire @DATE1 in the upper pininusula of @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 has been dating since the beginning of the year. She is sad @CAPS2 week is over and @CAPS4 is the start of a new school year. She has been patiently waiting for @DATE1 @CAPS3 to see him again. Finally came the first day of school and she skipped him and he @CAPS3 called him. A few weeks later she said to him are you dancing me or? He wanted to @CAPS4 for a long time. She has been patiently waiting for an answer from @CAPS4 but it never came. In the end she decided to dance him, but she never did. So @CAPS5 gabby and I did. @CAPS4, she's pissed on the outside, but inside, she's probably screaming today, she's "moved" and is now dating a boy named @PERSON2.
One day I will be super? ? ? . Everything I do is slow and I get rewarded? ? ? Slow I walk slow I speak slow. My mom was very patient with me, all she did was get me up to speed, she tried to motivate me and help me get ready for school, she brought me breakfast and put all my books in my on the back. I thank her for being so patient with me throughout the day. Someone was patient with me that day.
@CAPS4 Patience means if you order something and it takes a long time to find you. That's what kids do. I've been patient many times in my life, but when I think about patience, only one comes to mind. A @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to take pictures of our passports. @CAPS7 thinks @CAPS8 won't be a bush there. Boys @CAPS7 is wrong. @CAPS7 Get dressed up. When @CAPS7 completes, the clock reaches @NUM1. @CAPS7 got in the car, @CAPS7 is on the way. @CAPS4 and my little brother turn up the music and start singing, I @CAPS1 your @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents were angry and told us to turn off the music and stop singing. " Mom, our favorite song." @CAPS5 Our @CAPS6.PS. Said, "You've reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 is getting a little excited here." @CAPS7 entered the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 nearly fainted from the crowd. "Let's calm down, I mean how long does it take @CAPS8 when suddenly a deep voice said in my head, "@NUM2 hours later". My brother decided to bet with @CAPS4. "@CAPS8 you don't crack @ CAPS5 It's your turn to take pictures and I'll do anything for you in a week. You have your own deal. " @CAPS8 Another @NUM3 hours passed and I was about to scream. Then I fell deeper and fell asleep @CAPS5, @PERSON1 family is your next." The man with the long white beard, wearing glasses. @CAPS7 finally got in, got over it with @CAPS8. "@CAPS10, I won @CAPS11! I won the bet with a big smile on my face @CAPS12, you have to do whatever I want". I'm so glad I started doing the victory dance while the guy with the glasses and the beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a lunatic. @CAPS7 took our photo, @CAPS7 is down. Patience means waiting, waiting without whining. Everyone has to be patient in life like @CAPS4
On @DATE1 my dad, my brother and I went to @CAPS1 point. It's really hot, but we don't care if we really want to ride the Millennium Power. We found the route, but we looked at the route first and it was huge. It wobbled almost twice throughout the ride so we got to the end of the line and sat in the hot sun for half an hour until we found ourselves under the tent they pitched so the queue was cool. So we waited It got longer and longer until my brother started yelling and screaming, "I can't wait here any longer" @CAPS2 He went? ? and? ? Leave. My dad told me to wait in line while sprinting behind him. So I waited an hour and finally it was time for me to get in the car, but my dad and my brother weren't here so I decided to wait in line to get to the front of the ride. When I got in they were still not there, well, the ride took off and they weren't the best ride I've ever had.
My dad is at @ORGANIZATION1. He was away for a long time. The only time he came to see us was on @DATE1, nearing my birthday. But one year, my father didn't come home when he should have been. He wrote us a letter saying that they will keep all the soldiers for an extra six months. I was depressed the longest. But then I thought about it. Even with the delay, he returned hopeful. So instead of being disappointed, I decided to be patient. Our family sent him the care packer. Eventually he did come back. It was a tough time, but it was patient and taken into consideration.
When it comes to patience, you have to relax. When you are a doctor, you have to be patient. You will still be patient when you go to the doctor. You will be patient with someone when you get home. So remember, make sure you're patient with everything
I was on a diet around the time I was pacing. Once we went to @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2. Neither my family nor I can attend @ORGANIZATION3. But this line is clumsy. I'm the only one participating in @ORGANIZATION3. Because I'm in line for @ORGANIZATION3. My family has @CAPS1 @CAPS2 rid and @CAPS3 and even @ORGANIZATION1 in addition to riding different rides. Funny house on the same day as I was in line at the @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 fare wheel, I went to the stars of @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 and waited in line at the cashier, when I had got up to go to the cashier, my family Getting a massage. Passionate about @ORGANIZATION2.
Thunder! The bus stopped. We are finally here! I need a lot of patience to keep quiet and not yell at the world. I had to be patient the whole journey, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a group of other 5th graders. We've all been split into groups, packed and ready to stay at @ORGANIZATION1 for three days. I was excited and my friend told me to calm down and be patient. I feel a little embarrassed @CAPS4 I don't care. I finally accepted it and kept my cool. In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I'm stuck on how to make mine? ? ? @ORGANIZATION1 and a friend of mine named @PERSON1 in my group told me some thoughts, @CAPS4 I want to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I kept my cool and listened to her thoughts and I have to say, they are not bad. I thought about it? ? ? of? ? ? and use it in my pamting. ? ? ? Now we're close to @NUM1 feet tall? ? ? Ladder I have taken mine? ? ? The ascent and pull-down awesome became scary @CAPS3. I'm helping people climb the ladder right now. I'm patient @CAPS4 people, they took a long time! I was about to yell at this guy, @CAPS4 I said "be patient" to myself. @CAPS4 This kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he just sits on a big board. I asked him why he did this and I thought their responses were hilarious. They say he wants to fly to the top like @CAPS6. By the end of the three-day field trip, my patience had grown to the size of a spider monkey. Whenever my patience grows to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head tries to knock that idiot out. I've learned to be patient with someone, even if they're an idiot and not moving fast enough, I'll stay calm and make sure the spider monkey doesn't bump into people where it hurts the most.
I was watching @CAPS1 the other day. I'm bored and have nothing good. So my mom is on the computer. I told her that if I could go on, she would be fine. In @NUM1 minutes. I waited for her to finish. OK, now you can move on. thanks Mom. It's ok. I am patient. That's when I patiently turned on the computer
One time I have the patience is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 Adventure! @CAPS3 we were by the water park most of the time and it was fun. I seem to spend more time at @CAPS5 with the pool and @CAPS6 @CAPS7 - my favorite. We quickly got tired of water parks and decided @CAPS17 to go for the rides! We're trying to decide if the weather we want to continue? ? ? ? ? ? or "@CAPS8! & @CAPS9:- I decided to @CAPS5 to go on??? When we get there @CAPS5??? It's like an hour long. So i.e. comparable to long made up mils and in @CAPS11 @ After CAPS5 was lined up. Concouontly @CAPS5 rides there??? That??????? @NUM1 announces @CAPS13 we bend @CAPS17 to go and?????? for @CAPS5 thunder @ CAPS15 @CAPS16 Parks are closing "@CAPS17 Oops we had a long time at the water park @DATE1! "I'm waiting then @CAPS5 will be back next year and ask my mother soul on site, @CAPS18 you can see I've had experience with parking
The one time I had to be patient was on my birthday. One year my grandpa and grandma were late for my birthday. I had to wait a few hours. I sat down until they came. When they get here, we can eat cake. After that I open my present. It took them about @NUM1 hours to get here.
Place at Cedar Point. I'm so excited, I think I'm going to SEC , "Can we get on the dragster first?" @CAPS1 Why is it fun not to line up. This is an estimate and an hour wait time. "@CAPS2 Do you still want to ride?" Of course I did, so I knew I had to be patient to ride. It was hot as we waited and it felt like an hour as I passed @NUM1! But I know when patience takes its toll. When @NUM2 minutes passed, the car was in sight and we were in second place. Soaring! A car passed and a long blue race car stopped with my name all over it at @NUM5 and we went up the mountain like a meteorite crashing into the earth. When it was over, my patience paid off, @CAPS4 always has patience for racing at Cedar Point.
I'm writing a story about my patience, when I was in @NUM1 grade, I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1. I ordered with mom and dad and waited. The waiter said about @NUM2 minutes. Our food didn't come after @NUM2 minutes or @NUM4 or @NUM5 or @NUM6 or even @NUM7 minutes. An hour and eight minutes later, our food came. I've been waiting and I'm getting hungry. Instead of complaining or yelling, I sat in my seat and waited patiently.
When I was hurt the same day I was eating, I was patient and I was patient. I fell down the hall, I went to the office, and I waited patiently for them to call my mom. come pick me up. When my mom said she was going to take me to the @CAPS1 room. When we got there, it took me a long time to find a parking spot, and I was patient even with a broken hand. We finally found one and went in. My mom went to the font desk and told them I was there. We waited for a while and then a nurse came out and spoke in the room and she said I had to wait for a bed to open before I could take an x-ray. I saw a lady through the window, I knew it was for me, and she opened the door and asked @PERSON1. She asked us to follow her to a room where we waited about forty-five minutes and the doctor came in and took us to the X-ray room. When they were done, we went back to the room and waited for a while. Dr. Andil came in and said I didn't break anything, he gave me a brace and I went home, @CAPS2 I'm being patient with all of this.
When my birthday came, I was patient. I am waiting for my party at my dad's house @DATE1. My birthday is @NUM1 on @DATE2. I got a @CAPS1® from my dad for my birthday. When the arrival of my birthday , I was patient. I am waiting for my party at my dad's house on @DATE1 and my birthday is @NUM1 on @DATE2. I got a @CAPS1® from my dad for my birthday.
"@CAPS1 It's another @NUM1 day and I'm on my way to Cedar Point. I wonder what we'll be doing when we first get there? What will end up being my favorite ride? Maybe I can convince my mom to advance @ NUM1 days to travel?" "@CAPS2 mom" @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS3" her mother said. “@CAPS4 We @CAPS1 go???? Order now?” “@CAPS5 Honey, our tickets were purchased on @DATE1, your @CAPS1 must be patient.” “Ok, I’ll try.” "Atta Girl"! As @PERSON1 was on her way to her room, she was thinking that if she tried to take her attention away from this, she might forget. To that end, she called her friend @CAPS6 to see if she wanted to come over. @CAPS6 says @CAPS3! The "@CAPS7" doorbell rang. "@CAPS2 @CAPS6 Want to play in my room?" "Or". @CAPS10 That night @CAPS6 went home and @PERSON1 went to bed. @NUM3 days @CAPS10. Only one day left? ? ? go with! ” @CAPS10 That night @PERSON1 slept around @NUM4 for a good night’s sleep???Travel. But for @ORGANIZATION1, she woke up at @CAPS1 a few hours @CAPS10. She was so excited she couldn’t sleep! She finally fell asleep, and they left early the next morning.
Patience is useful at certain times, like waiting for a blood test or for me yours? ? ? again. Patience is useless at other times, like in the army, any army, you sometimes wait to die at the hands of the enemy. Patience is mostly good because if you rush, you could hurt someone, miss something useful, or just something you like.
I'm at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 when I'm patient, I'm waiting to get on the dragster, the line is long. We waited @NUM1 hours and we are still waiting in line. Finally we got there and they said the ride would be closed for a while and something had to be checked and it took them a full hour to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park, we were waiting for the train to come, it came, the train took @NUM2 minutes, when we got to the other side of the park, I wanted to get on the train, this is shooting the rapids line is really long, So we waited and waited and finally it was our turn, which was fun, and then when it was over we came back. On the train back to the other side. We got back to the car, then the team came back, we waited and waited, and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait that was the first time I had to endure that long and I was about to lose my mind, but we didn't. We will return this @CAPS3.
I was patient when I went for a pair and we had to wait in line for two hours. I'm just bored standing there, but I really want to go for a ride and that's what the queues are for. I'm trying to be patient with hole time so I can get my @CAPS1? ? Keep riding because I hate standing there all the time and my feet start hurting badly because I am? ? ? ? ? ? There I finally got to the front of the line to get my ticket and I was happy, that's when I was patient.
When I'm Patient: I'm patient when my family, friends, or teachers speak. I don't cut in while they're talking, I wait until I'm sure they're done talking. Another thing is politeness, I'm polite in class, at home I don't have my turn to speak. Another thing is that I'm really nice to people, I don't mean anything to anyone, I listen to what they say. When I was at school, sometimes you had to wait for your turn. Like having a drink, or having lunch, or lining up for Fire Drill. You can also be nice and patient if someone doesn't finish, you can help them and it will be very nice and patient. These are all things I do for patience.
Hi, I'm @PERSON1 and this is my time to be patient. My mom and stepdad are taking me and my stepsister to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. but! ! With a twist, we can't ask "are we there yet". So we had to wait a long time. But when we got there it was so worth the wait.
Patience is sometimes hard to come by. But that doesn't mean you should give up and keep trying, your will will succeed, rush through your life, become impatient, you'll get used to it, and you'll succeed. I'll tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience. “@CAPS1 is having a big race in the fall. All the animals in @CAPS2 are coming. It’s a phenomenal event. The tradition of @CAPS1 year is one slow animal and one around the commute first to see who Is this a champ. @CAPS5 was the fastest @CAPS2 at the time. @CAPS11 registered for @CAPS1 year and won @CAPS1 time. @CAPS15 is already registered to finish this year. @CAPS11 is very mindful of herself and has to feel for @CAPS12 Proud because @CAPS11 is slow and @CAPS11 can't be a champion. "Runners ready! ' shouted the announcer. @CAPS5 and @CAPS15 lined up. "@CAPS3 @CAPS4!" ! "@CAPS5 kicked the air forward. Because @CAPS15 waited very slowly in the back. @CAPS5 ran like @CAPS11 never won. @CAPS11 never looked back. @CAPS11 wants to win. The trophy is rightfully any of his Way. Right? I mean, @CAPS11 is the fastest animal. @CAPS15 keeps going, slowly but surely to the finish line." @CAPS6 @CAPS6. "@CAPS5 stopped and looked around. No one around." @CAPS9 "Is that noise?" @CAPS11 exclaimed. "@CAPS6" It came from his stomach. @CAPS11 is so engaged @CAPS11 doesn't realize how hungry @CAPS11 is. "@CAPS12 A handful of berries." @CAPS11 decided. @CAPS11 picked one, and then another. Finally @CAPS11 was full and a little sleepy. "I'll take a nap @CAPS12, after all @CAPS15 won't catch up anyway." @CAPS11 fell asleep. @CAPS5 wonder @CAPS11 has been eating and napping, @CAPS15 caught up? @ CAPS11 see @ CAPS5 sleeping, decided not to let him @ CAPS12 to @ CAPS11 is sick @ CAPS11 continue to slowly very slowly up the hill to the finish line. @CAPS5 Awakened by sound or cheers. @CAPS11 stood up. @CAPS15 won! @CAPS11 made it to the finish line but was late, @CAPS15 already won. @CAPS11 might win if @CAPS11 has patience.
In my 13 years of experience, I've had a lot of roller coasters, and when there's a roller coaster, it's usually a two-hour wait. In @DATE1 @NUM1 I took my best friend @PERSON1 to "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" and we just lined up for a ride called "@CAPS3". When we got to the entrance, @CAPS4 said there was a 45 minute wait, so we queued but the car was parked for over three hours. In the end, the ride was up and running, but @CAPS4 took another half hour to test, and when the test was over, @CAPS4 waited two hours in the back. We're up front, so @CAPS4 doesn't really affect us. We ended up on this path and totally worth it @CAPS4. Most of the lines later in the day were small, but that was still an hour. I just hope the next ride doesn't break down.
I remember a long time ago, I endured for a long time. I endured it for about four months. I'm waiting to get the video game system @CAPS1. I am very patient with this. So basically what happened was this new, high-tech, amazing game system came out. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1. Everyone craved it. including me. The only problem is that they are all sold out. So at Christmas, my dad told me he would buy me one. I am very happy. But we all know it will be a long time before he gets one. So I waited, waited, waited. Then one night near @TIME1, my dad woke me up. He said they sold a lot @CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to the hottest place, and queued for a long time. Finally, it's our turn. We bought @CAPS1, went home and set it up. The next day, I finally played my @CAPS1: It's a story about how patient I've always been.
My mom went to the doctor a few weeks ago before going to school? ? ? We went there like @NUM1 and didn't leave until @NUM2. So I played a game with my little sister to entertain myself. So we watch TV, we play on our iPods, we tell stories that we're bored of. So once everything got boring, we had to sit and wait for school, but I was just wondering how many? ? ? it is? ? ? Yes? ? ? We left so lie? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Until darling gets up and? ? ? Fly cut on our seats. But later found out it was someone else. ? ? ? than me and? ? ? ? ? ? Fell asleep. Then all of a sudden I felt someone shaking me and saying "lexi tayler" and my mom called over and over until we woke up, so now? ? ? Are you ready? ? ? Then go to the mall. So we went to the mall and spent the rest of the day. This is my story about me sitting patiently at the doctor? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
“@CAPS1 Can I have a puppy?” “@CAPS2” “@CAPS3 @CAPS1 “@CAPS4 in @DATE1 Please be patient. " "@CAPS5. " @CAPS6 @CAPS7 downstairs glum, she thought of a brilliant plan to make @NUM1 days go faster until @DATE1, "I'll make a @NUM1 link long paper chain." ” @CAPS8 days or @NUM1 days she ripped a link. She ripped @CAPS9 then @CAPS10 or even @CAPS11 years. Before she knew it, it was @DATE1 first. @CAPS7 jumped out of bed and ripped Dropped the last link saying: "@CAPS1 I could have a puppy, but I'm patient. " @CAPS13 Look," her @CAPS1 said. Your dad and I have been thinking, it's a big responsibility, so @CAPS4 next @DATE1. "@CAPS14 I'll be patient." "
This is the story of a vampire named @CAPS1 going to ordinary middle school. It's the first day of school and @CAPS1 is lining up for his schedule and later mix. And the line is really long. @CAPS1 was late on the first day and had to get behind the line. The people in front of him have been complaining, @CAPS1 is getting more and more ??. This will go on forever! " Complaining about the person in front." @CAPS3, shut up, man. I don't like this more than you do, but do you see me complaining? "@CAPS1 exclaimed. Everyone in the gym stopped talking and looked in his direction. Not a good sign. @CAPS1 stopped talking, just waited in line. Been listening to @NUM1 minutes on his ipod @CAPS5 After the music, he was @NUM2 people away from the front of the line. Then bad things happened. "@CAPS3 This is not my schedule! ' said a blonde. Whoever posted the schedule had to call everyone to see who had hers. So @NUM1 minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If @CAPS1 doesn't have the patience, He wouldn't be in line for @NUM4 minutes! Good thing he brought his ipod @CAPS5!
Once I patiently waited @NUM1 to @NUM2 for my brother @PERSON1 for a whole month, he is now @NUM3. @CAPS1 feels like @CAPS1 in @NUM2,000 years? ? ? I can't wait for a long time, but I have to be patient. He was scheduled for @DATE2, but he was out on @DATE1. When I came to ????. Finally at @NUM5 on @DATE1, my brother @PERSON1 was finally born? ? ? @NUM2 months. This? ? ? I used it once? ? ?
I remember when I, my brother, my father and my mother were in the snow. I want to take so many rides, but they all have huge lines. So we waited an hour for the rapter to get on, but when we got on it felt like it was longer than the queue, it felt like @NUM1 hours because ??? it was. we're gone, see? ? ? Force it to have one? ? ? ? ? ? So we waited in line much longer than the rapter, about 3-@NUM1 hours. But when we climbed the stairs, it was so much fun because we waited so long and my brother stopped because he was so??? at me. The ride was fun, but when we were done we had to leave? ? ? Just like mom. We only waited on the rides, but it was fun, and? ? ? That's when I have patience.
My friends and others showed loyalty in a drama called @CAPS1 Kids @CAPS2. They come once a year. Everyone was ready, learning their part, and we had a show in one week. We show loyalty through mutual trust. When you're on stage in front of people, you have to support each other. When someone forgets to get in on time, you help them by reminding them next time. When someone forgets their line, you say it for them. We show our loyalty to each other for @NUM1 days. The show has been great every year because of mutual support.
I broke my finger almost a week ago at @CAPS1.R and I'm patient.
I'm not a very patient person? ? ? But mine for a while? ? ? I am very patient. I'm in @NUM1 grade and doing something called ??? Mrs Bowos @NUM2 grade. Where will we go? ? ? As you probably know, @NUM2 graders are not very good readers, but there is one girl who is not good at all. does she need? ? ? Everyone @PERSON1's help will be sent to ??? Help that girl? ? ? She struggled a lot, she would never rent she would close the book as if it were on fire? ? ? . But it's patient, every time she? ? ? Every time she stops reading. I will let her move on. Every time she puts it on the floor, do I? ? ? . In the end the girl sees it doesn't accomplish anything? ? ? This, that's why she saw it. Now I'm going to be patient with her reading speed. IP She doesn't know a word, I will help her read it out. The girl got better and better at reading until she didn't need me anymore. But I pride myself on being patient once.
My take on patience is when someone is doing something. You have to wait until they are done. If you push them, they may make mistakes or do the wrong thing. Patience is a very important thing. Patience is also a very respectful thing to another person because you are not rude.
There have been many times I've been patient, but this time was not too long ago. In fact, just yesterday, I was having breakfast. I just sit there and finish, just read and draw. It's absolutely boring, lame, and seconds feel like hours. It sucks, but I'm not complaining, I'm just sitting there doing nothing. That was probably the worst moment when I wanted to talk but couldn't.
The patented time is when I'm in school, I'm in math, I'm in class so I can go to my friends @ORGANIZATION1 so I'm waiting, whatins, whatins, watins and whatins @CAPS1, the clock is not tennin, so Started doing my classwork and @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2 rang I'm a @CAPS3 agen @CAPS1 is a @CAPS5 @CAPS1 it's not a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cons we have meap so it's just a @CAPS9 @CAPS10 in all classes so we Only @CAPS11 @NUM1 mins left until the moms come out so I @CAPS12 some people want @NUM2 mins to go and then me and I dodge. That's good @NUM2 minutes to so @NUM4 minutes @NUM5 minutes @NUM6 @NUM7 @NUM8 @NUM9 @NUM10 @NUM11 @NUM12 @NUM12 now @NUM1 seconds left rims then @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS13 when
There were people queuing for hot pizza because they were hot and ready, and a lot of people were lining up and everyone was screaming and pissed because they thought pizza should be hot and ready. Everyone is throwing tanruns. The children sat quietly on their little benches and watched them lose their temper. People who work at cedses are trying because there are a lot of people there and everyone is drinking. No one showed any patience. They only care about pizza. Hungry children are more patient than angry adults. They're all complaining, and everyone says they don't want to hear from you, so you have to shut up. Once there, he waited patiently in line with his mouth shut. He was too lazy to speak. Everyone was back to normal, everyone had a smile on their face, even the little ones, everyone got their pizza quickly. Always be patient.
I asked my mother if I could have something to eat. She @CAPS12 didn't say @CAPS1 so I waited and waited and waited and then I went upstairs and waited for @CAPS2. I'm hungry and then I've been patient @CAPS3. I usually use @CAPS4 for @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, I do. Another time @CAPS9 Thanksgiving I'm patient @CAPS3 they are cooking @CAPS4 and they @CAPS12 haven't cooked @CAPS4 so we wait until @CAPS4 is @CAPS16 our stomachs are growling for @CAPS4 so I @CAPS13 a man patient @CAPS3 I waited until @CAPS4 was @CAPS16.
Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don't. It will show people your character whether you are patient or not. Sometimes it's tough, but we'll all get through it. For example, I have to be patient when I'm at a restaurant that's taking a long time to get the food in front of us. I was sitting at the table after ordering and I was really bored so I decided to color with the crayons I got. After finishing, I decided to find something else to do while I waited. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came over and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued talking and went to the bathroom. When I came back, our food was there! So, I sat down and enjoyed a delicious meal. When I'm patient, I'm well rewarded. Good things always happen to those who are patient. If you are not a patient person, then you can always try to be one. It's not hard to keep yourself busy!
When I finish my book, I use patience. We have these things called teacher talks where you can tell the teacher what you accomplished with your book. I finished the @NUM1 book titled "Sisterhood of Traveling Saints". I finished the last two books. I wrote my name on the blackboard for the teacher to teach. The teacher kept picking on others. I had to wait until I got the call. Every day I go to @NUM2 and @NUM3 hours hoping I'll be called. But it doesn't happen every day. I finished another book, so I wrote my name again. But I still didn't get the call. I call @PERSON1 @NUM4 witch means I finished reading @NUM5 book. Finally @DATE1 my name was called. A generation? ? ? Teacher of all @NUM5 books. I had to tell her about my book and I'm glad my name was called.
I am very patient at the dentist's office. I was putting on my bracts when I went to the dentist's office. As I sat there they told me they had to get my stand and wires. When they got the brackets and wires, I had to pick the color. I waited about @NUM1 minutes. No complaints. Next, they started putting the brackets on the glue. It was weird to me when they put a bracket on me, the kido tasted like heated metal "@CAPS1" I said. After they put on the brockets, they paint it. My mouth hurts like crazy! When it was all over, I noticed that it had been @NUM2 hours! I was surprised because I didn't know I sat there for @NUM2 hours, but I was very patient and waited! That's when I wait patiently at the dentist's office.
When I'm very patient is when I go to "@CAPS1" at the ceider point. I went to ceider point with my @NUM1 aunt and @NUM1 cousins. Just the older girls go because if we bring villains, we're new and we can't go into the haunted house, although we did. It was so much fun before we got in line. They are very long. I mean it took us about an hour and a half to get on the roller coaster. I had a long chat with my cousins. We're in the back of the whole section, called the "dead zone," which is scary but fun at the same time. What a strange feeling. We finally got into this place and we still had a long way to go, climbing stairs, going through fences, it was horrible. But what we're complaining about is, it's not me. Unlike my cousins, I am very patient. We finally got to the top floor, can you believe it, we have to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us busy, but not for long. Then we looked, realized how far we were, and started talking about how scary it would be to fall. Then we move on. But it wasn't long before we had people saying "Wait a minute to check and make sure the @CAPS2 coaster doesn't have any mechanical issues." That's when my cousins left. We tried to calm her down. So we all just sat and waited. Finally, the team moved forward again. Then we got to the top of the @CAPS3 roller coaster. We finally got to see the @CAPS2 roller coaster, and I think it looked like time flew by then, maybe because we were so excited. We finally got in the car and it was one of the funniest rides in the entire park called "The mauerie". I guess the wait was worth it. The ride was about NUM3 per hour, jerky, dripping and fun. We're a little bit patient, but do we have enough patients to start over, I don't think so.
The other day when I bought a dirt bike helmet online, it said three days for shipping, which is not a long time for me. Day 3 arrived and while I was waiting on the porch for my helmet to come, my mom told me my helmet was stuck on @LOCATION1 and wouldn't show up until next week. After she told me, I thought it did take some patience as I went to work with my dad the following week. At the end of the week, I was sitting on the porch waiting when the @ORGANIZATION1 truck came over to give me my brand new helmet and I almost fell asleep.
Once my friend was waiting for me and I was there for an hour and although he couldn't wait for me to get out of the bathroom, I kept waiting for me and I said thank you and he would say whenever I was surprised by her.
When it's @DATE1 @CAPS1 I can't wait for @DATE1 so I open my present. My parents gave it to my sister, my second sister and me. Give us money so we can go and buy what we like. My parents give us money. Just like my mom and dad, I remember I bought a cute cuformin boot and I can wait to open the boot on @DATE1, I'm on @CAPS2 and ask can we open a gift, it's @DATE1 @CAPS1 and My parents said no and I got angry. So the next day I woke up on @DATE1 and in the morning above @NUM1 I looked in the living room and no one got up so I had to wait until my patent woke up and I could wait, long forever, that's me waiting Insufficient time.
I think patience is waiting and not rushing. If you are patient, things will actually go faster than you think, for example if you want something you have to wait in line instead of running away to find something else and then waiting for it will always help. Be patient with what you do, even if it's waiting to run the school. If you're waiting for the same people to come and sit, be patient as it might get you out of trouble. Even if you are waiting for the turn, be patient, it's no big deal, don't rush, just be patient.
"@CAPS1 on @CAPS2, where are you," @PERSON1 said in dismay. @CAPS2 should be @CAPS1 going to his house. @PERSON1 just bought a new trampoline and they are planning to bounce all day after school. @PERSON1 started to worry but he waited. Finally his mom came to tell him that @CAPS2 wasn't coming. Just then the phone rang. @PERSON1 answered the phone and finally heard @CAPS2. "@CAPS5, @PERSON1," @CAPS2 whispered. His voice is not very good. "@CAPS2," @PERSON1 shouted into the phone, "@CAPS2, @CAPS2 where are you." "I'm at my house, you come here. @PERSON1's mom stopped at @CAPS2's house to let him out. @PERSON1 At this point, ignoring his demeanor, he opened the door and strode to @CAPS2's room. @CAPS2 was lying on the bed looking at his face looking very swollen. He turned to look at @PERSON1, stared at him, then looked again To the ceiling. @CAPS2 wasn't at school that day either. He went skiing at his house's cabin. I was impatient when I was in the air. I was overwhelmed and if I waited, none of this would have happened."
One time I was patient was at my dad's house. Our power just went out, so we wanted to wait two minutes as usual. After a few days, we had no electricity and I got sick. On the third day we called people and figured it out??? They fixed it before our power line and we got the power back.
I think patience is important for two reasons. The first is because if you are impatient, you may end up distracting others around you. For example, if you finished the @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling other people to get their heads down, it would be distracting. Now you interrupted everyone, they've lost their minds, and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking the dog and pulled my little sister down hard and my dog ran away. We had to wait patiently for him to come back. My sister kept trying to call my mom and tell her the dog ran away again, but I told her it was rude to call because it would distract her from work. Another reason patience is important is that if you are impatient, you can get hurt. Let's say you're going down stairs and your sibling is in front of you and you need to go down quickly, but they're going down the stairs very slowly, so you push them and they might get hurt. In short, patience is always needed and cannot be forgotten
The "@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1" clock is counting down "@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1" is approaching, and the clock keeps going. My heart beats like a racing engine. I can hear my heart is prosperity, is grace? ? ? My head is a mess, what am I going to do? ? ? Jump in the pool, watch, video games. So many options, what should I do "@CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS1" I can almost hear pael calling me "swim, swim swim" what should I do. I look at Mrs.sprowl and then back to the clock, then mrs.sprowl and then back to the clock and mrs.sprawl. My heart almost jumped out of my body, so much anticipation. "@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 "Almost there" I stared at the second hand "@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1" So close I said, so close with @NUM1 seconds left, I can swim." @NUM2 "I almost jumped out of my seat and yelled "@NUM3" @CAPS2, @CAPS2, @CAPS2 "We have some announcements" Mrs White said. I'm glad I ran aside and waited for my dad so I was free.
I am very patient. I'm happy outside, but inside, I wish I could get a better score
My mom was always like this when I was a kid. I'm so patient I can't do this I'm writing this about her. My mom is nice, cool, rich, and most importantly, patient. I did a lot as a kid and there were hours when my mom just calmed herself down like we didn't do anything. It's interesting how much patience she has. long, long ago. I remember wasting grape soda on her new rug! ! Wow, how scared I am...I think I peeed my pants! ! @CAPS4 I didn't hide it like the other kids when she got home, I cried to @CAPS3 I wasted pop on your rug don't be mad "she answered in her soothing motherly loving voice," @CAPS1 I rant about cleaning it up. "I handed her a dry towel and set it aside, just remember this time it was a kid I couldn't reach the sink) @CAPS4 without yelling, she went up the stairs and wet the towel herself. I Staying under the stairs watching @CAPS2 purple mess I was trying to help mom, "Sit down. " She said, holding my hand. Then my mother has got rid of the stains, I soon slept on the sofa. My mother kissed me on the cheek @ CAPS4, she did not wake her pick me up !! , the show begins. "@CAPS3 is that you? ? " I said in my morning voice. My mom is a @CAPS4 patient." @CAPS4 What's for breakfast? ? "In a high voice. I'll go." She said she'd bring out my breakfast. I love my mom.
@CAPS7 year @CAPS4 went to @ORGANIZATION1, about two weeks before school starts. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1's school just opened that day, so no waiting in line. @CAPS4 couldn't or chose a better day. And then @CAPS4 got to the trap I didn't want to go on, but @CAPS5 mom said "@CAPS1 will go wrong, @CAPS2? I said "@CAPS3 is fine, I'll keep riding" @CAPS4 is about to take off up the hill, and when @CAPS4 arrives At the top, the ride stopped. I freaked out at first, but then I got over it. So we've been there for about @NUM1 minutes or @NUM2 and @CAPS4 have to be patient. @CAPS5 Mom and Dad in there. @CAPS4 was uncomfortable on the bike seat @CAPS4. Then another @NUM3 min was pasted and now @CAPS4 has been on top for @NUM4 min. @CAPS7 yes @CAPS4 must be totally quiet and patient. Then the ride starts, @CAPS4 got down to the bottom and finished the ride. They gave us passes to cut in line on the @CAPS8 force. That's all they gave us. So @CAPS4 had a great time the rest of the day, but I was Life has learned that you have to be patient!
Once upon a time, they were a princess named @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 is invited to a royal ball where @CAPS1 is waiting for her handsome prince. When her wagon arrived, @CAPS1 followed people before getting off. Finally @CAPS1 got out of the car. @ORGANIZATION1 walks off the red carpet. With the arrival of @CAPS1, the noise grew louder and louder, and the princess finally approached the open door. The beautiful girl went to her throne and led the people of the village to dance among her. @PERSON1 sat for two hours. @CAPS1 wanders "Will he show up?" and "Will he like me?" @CAPS1 doubts her luck. The princess picked up the microphone, "@CAPS2! @CAPS2! @CAPS3 know where my prince is?" "@CAPS3?" The crowd fell silent. Finally at the last minute. '@CAPS4' An irregular voice sounded. I am the prince! " A relaxed sigh came from her." @ CAPS5 me. "I'm late ??? with a dragon and one thousand knights fighting. Come here to see my wife!" Wow! The crowd said softly. They have lived happily ever since. @CAPS6!
One time I was patient was when my mom took me to get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there, the parking lot was full, I mean the cars were so close you could barely get in and out without scratching someone else's car. My mom parked the car across the street. When we got there it stopped at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 people. People are standing close together and you can know their body temperature. The bench was full of people, and they stopped like idiots. It's hot and smells like a must. We picked a ticket with @NUM3 and they were on @NUM4. We waited two hours. My mother wants to leave. I was sleeping when they got to our number. I lost ten pounds while we were there.
I am not a very patient person. I'm always complaining and complaining. If patience means you're in a place for a full time without complaining, then I guess I'm patient some of the time, but only if a friend is there to keep me busy. Once my mom was in the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there and we hung out together. It's actually fun. We ate at the cafeteria. We stole some milk for no reason and completely forgot my mom was there. I didn't complain once. Then we were scolded and had to go back to the waiting room, but it wasn't too bad. That's one of the few patiences I have, and since I've been with someone, I don't know if it matters.
"@CAPS1!" I yelled as the ball came over the net to me. "That's @CAPS1!" @CAPS2 said. "@CAPS3 I'm already there," I replied. "@CAPS4. @CAPS3 This is @CAPS1." @CAPS13 argued. "@CAPS5 I said @CAPS1, you??? Move and let me get it then wimp @CAPS6 me. And watch the ball fall. I exclaim." @CAPS7 I guess. "@CAPS2 Apologies. This is a volleyball tryout and I have to be patient and work together." @CAPS9 is @CAPS10 @CAPS11! " Asked by the A-team coach." @CAPS12 Threesomes! "@CAPS13 said??? Mu's two best friends som and @PERSON1 are already with this new girl and she's great. "You want to partner and produce with me?" "@CAPS14 asked. "@CAPS15," I responded. We were up against @CAPS16 when it was our turn to use @CAPS11, and @PERSON1 attacked us. Katie missed the ball completely. New girl @ PERSON1 and @CAPS16 cheered. "@CAPS18! Well done ladies! One of the coaches. This is the end of the second @DATE1 tryout. Only one @DATE1 left. @CAPS3 is hard for me, I try to stay united and patient. On @DATE1 of the tryouts , we got to know our team. We all got the envelopes and opened them at the same time. Me, @CAPS16 and @PERSON1 and some other good girls made up Team A! So that's when I had to be very patient and stay together, @CAPS3 I still succeeded.
Once upon a time there was a boy named @PERSON1. Howell, he's right, he's Secretary of State, he? ? Patience so he went in and got a number and took his paper from the woman. At the front desk? ? ? and? ? ? ? ? ? and started? ? ? It came out and it was only on @NUM1 she counted slowly so he was pissed! ! Still have time? ? Pass and ??? open? ? and? ? Leave in front of him to go there? ? ? The secretary card and the lady in front of him behind the desk open and call @PERSON1, he uses ? ? ? She took the picture, he got the license and it was over
I was patient when my dog had to go to @CAPS1 because he was really sick because he had my mom's heart worm and I just thought about it for about two hours and I wasn't as patient as my mom , because I keep asking my mom what happened. We had to take longer after the surgery until we had my dog back naked for almost NUM1 hours. After @CAPS1 called us and we went to pick up my dog, the doctor told him he had to water him until he could get up and move, all was well, we played in the snow for a long time @CAPS3.
what! Oh hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I'm going to tell you how I'm waiting for @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS2 to do something sweet. Okay, I heard about this awesome but scary place called @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Me and a few of my friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are planning to be there @CAPS7 on @DATE2. So far I've been doing normal things with them. @CAPS5 get up, @CAPS5 shower, @CAPS5 get dressed, @CAPS7 go to school. Today @DATE1, @CAPS8 is going to my parents' house and @CAPS7 to check online to see when it's open. @CAPS8 found out that the new location is opening in two days. It's near the living room, on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. So @CAPS8 sneaked it and its neighborhood so @CAPS8 was read screaming like a baby when its bottle was taken. Today is the day @CAPS8 is on the road, but @CAPS8 does realize how many people will be there. There will be at least @NUM3 people waiting when @CAPS8 gets there! @CAPS8 queue, about every @NUM4 minutes the queue is reduced by @NUM5 people. Then at the end about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 waiting @CAPS8 to @NUM7. It's also just my own luck, @NUM1 people don't have enough patience to wait, but @CAPS8 respects it. Then @PERSON2 had to @CAPS7 to use the restroom so @CAPS8, cross the road so he could @CAPS7 then when @CAPS8 came back @CAPS8 ended up on top @NUM9! @CAPS8 waited for another @NUM10 and @CAPS8 is here! @PERSON2 was crying when @CAPS8 was done (he's @NUM11!) @PERSON1 peed his pants (he's @NUM12!) and @NUM13 I did nothing, @CAPS8 had a night but if @ CAPS8 is less patient, it will never happen.
Patience is a very important thing. Respect yourself if it helps you and others. If you are impatient, things will only get worse. My cousin is a big fan of @PERSON1. She wanted tickets for his concert, but when it was sold out online, she didn't know where else to get it. She didn't know where else to get them. She saw on the news that the concert was giving away tickets that morning. She wants to be first. Well, the same goes for everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to stand in line for hours to see two tickets. Finally at the front desk, she got the ticket. She was patient and didn't complain. Later that night, she pushed the fifth row seat close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1's face, showing that patience pays off in the end. Maybe if my cousin had been so patient, she would have gotten the ticket. Patients will give you @NUM2 a long way, especially if it's trying to gain respect. My cousin inspired me to be @NUM2 patient and maybe one day I'll get concert tickets.
When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 and his mom and dad. @PERSON1 suffers from depression. And he likes watching games. He likes to cheer them on when they play. He also likes to say hi to them after they're done playing. I didn't laugh at him. I think is a really cool guy. He likes to talk about 'suff like sport's are cartoon's. I didn't please him to win his talk. I did not win or win him walk funny he made eight Gua. He considers everyone to be his document. When he was in line, his movements changed a lot. The wen @DATE1 port he shouted had the ball and was getting ready to go down. When he gets angry at the spig port, there is no ball and they score. I @CAPS1 he we'll get it @CAPS2. He said yeah I'm that one now. So he likes to keep watching. But they won't let that feel up so I @CAPS1 He's going to be patient so he'll calm down. After the game, his mom took us to @LOCATION1's house. We sat in @CAPS2 and it was rude and laborious. But she wasn't angry. Even now we have to set in an hour-long traffic jam. So after all I think patience is what it is.
Are you patient? Well, I always have patience. I'm going to tell you when I was patient at school. One day I'm going to register for the school and it's very busy there. I had to wait at least ten to fifteen minutes for each line. By the time I finally got all the paperwork done, I had to take a photo of my ID. When I finished taking the photo I went to get my ID. It came out suddenly, but my eyes were closed. So I had to wait in line again to take more pictures. Then I went to get my other ID. I waited a long time, about twenty minutes. My second ID came out and it messed up. The lady told me that when I start school, I'll get it right. That was when I had patience in my life.
My patience was during the last @DATE1. My friends and I are waiting in line to get autographed by detrnit tiger @NUM1 baseman @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Was going out to meet the players? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ???????????????????????????????????????????????? and then left. This is my patient day.
I am patient when I go to the doctor. My mom and I waited a long time when I went to the doctor. It felt like a few years but it was alone for @NUM1 hours and then when the doctor told us to go back to our room and wait for a long time, we waited another half hour. I asked my mom "why is it always like this" and my mom said "because the rest of them are in front of us." "Oh" I said ok.
"@CAPS1 I was patient at the water park that day, I got @CAPS1 a water slide. But they were like @NUM1 guys in front of me. Also, I was hot, I don't know what if you don't have flip flops , I'm going to be hot. But anyway, I really want to get @CAPS1 this water slide. So I stand patiently and let @CAPS1 water slide. Then I said to myself, if or I'm going to get mad, better get mad. But it' @CAPS2 I'll be patient. I hope this ride will be fun @CAPS1.
I was patient when I was taking it last year? ? ? It's not done. I hate to be patient and get bored when I do. The patient seems to take forever. Then people start getting headaches, and then you get into trouble because your mom, dad or teacher talks too much. That's why I don't like patience.
Patience is when you can wait a long time without complaining, I don't think I have much patience. I think patience is like standing in line for hours and not caring because you are very patient, but everything requires patience gaming, driving, eating, etc, even at school requires a lot of patience.
Every school year I wait patiently for the @DATE1 vacation. It's as scary as waiting for @DATE1, but it's worth it.
Hi, I'm @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I have green eyes, blond hair, and I have a great personality. OK, so I'm going to tell you when I'm focused. OK, I think last year was @NUM1 and @DATE1. Mom and I were left to see the doctor. So we left @NUM2 after school started. So when we got there, I was just bored waiting for @NUM3 hours. I didn't know what to do, so I saw @CAPS3 fish, I watched about @NUM4 and did nothing, finally the ladies at the counter said, "@PERSON1 then I knew it was our turn. So here we go Went into the room where I was lying in bed. I fell asleep unexpectedly, but when I was sleeping they gave me a painful shot and it hurt so bad. Then I woke up and that was "I'm patient" ".
Once, when I was patient, I ended up with an @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, I asked for an @ORGANIZATION1 and my @CAPS2 said maybe. So I waited all year and I knew I was going to get one, but I kept waiting and you know I got a blue @ORGANIZATION1 and on top of @NUM1 new goues. But over time I know I'm going to get @ORGANIZATION1 and I'm going crazy. But when I finally got it, I'm glad my patience was worth it, especially since I've been waiting for my @ORGANIZATION1.
“@CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1!!” @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 runs down the stairs. "@CAPS4 gotta get this cool new book! It looks really good. Please, please, please!" @CAPS4 has to do some errands before @CAPS4 goes. " Reply to @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1." @CAPS6 You have the patience @CAPS4 to get this book. " Convince her @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 People who want this book bad answer well, they go to errands. They go to the gas station, then the post office, then the car wash, and finally the grocery store. At the grocery store @ORGANIZATION1 Helping her @CAPS1 shopping. @ORGANIZATION1 was patient all day and never complained once. "Last item on the list is pasta for dinner," @CAPS1 of @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1." @CAPS7 I can't seem to find it . " "I'll look for it." " @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1 is dying for her book. @ORGANIZATION1 looks down each aisle until she finally finds the pasta she @CAPS1 was looking for. When @ORGANIZATION1 finally finds her @CAPS1 she is checking out. When the cashier @ORGANIZATION1 and her @CAPS1 went to their car to unload after the clerk finished ringing all items. When they got to their house, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot the book until her @CAPS1 walked up to her and gave it to her Got her. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 She thanked you and realized that patience is not that hard.
I was so patient when my mom went to the doctor and she was having a baby, I had to wait @NUM1 hours in the waiting room? ? ? .
Patience, that's what my family doesn't have. This is the story. I was doing the dishes and my brother was crying because my sister @PERSON2 hit him. So it feels like @CAPS1 is crying (my little brother). @CAPS3 started crying (my little sister). So my stepfather is playing with his iphone. He'll be giving a shout out to @CAPS1 soon. You know what he does. Well, do you think it will get better? correct. I told @CAPS3 to stop crying. But @CAPS1 won't, so here I am calling @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 has to hit her and then my stepdad started going crazy because he's still crying @PERSON2 is a stair-stepping kid. When? ? ? get? ? ? calm down. Now just when I was going crazy @PERSON1 (my brother) came in and took @CAPS1 down the stairs to calm him down. Thanks @CAPS7, thanks @ORGANIZATION1. Then I asked @CAPS3 to calm down. What a great day, I think my family was really patient, not my stepfather.
We all have times when we are very patient and when we lose all patience. Well, yesterday, I was patient with my sister, @PERSON2 had a tantrum and she was nasty. I don't know what makes her so annoying. She became very mean and violent. This is the story. We walked home yesterday. Everything is going smooth. When we got home, mom told us we had to clean up. Well, our room is clean and I won't let @PERSON2 go up and clean" it. She screamed and cried. @MONTH1 I remind you, she's ten. She's rushing up the stairs, talking to her on the phone. "Friend" @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet zazin she screamed. So our sister @ORGANIZATION1 made @NUM1 say to turn it off, hang up, and clean. Then @ PERSON2 Let's listen to @PERSON1's texts. I admit @PERSON1 is not very good. So we told @PERSON2 not to answer the phone. We didn't yell, we were very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just let her Screaming alone. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she was grounded and no longer allowed to talk, text, or even at school Talking to @PERSON1. My mom also appreciates @PERSON3 and my patience. This is the story of how I am patient. I'm not the most patient person, but I have my time and so should everyone else. If you have patience, In the long run, life will be much better!
My @CAPS1 patience was last week and yesterday. My @CAPS1 was very patient with daycas, I was late for school, it was a qetider layman, but he stopped, so @CAPS1 dismissed wat, didn't walk up to him, and didn't blow the next time I was Whisper and him. @CAPS1 was patient, my @CAPS1 was waiting for me outside when I was at the basketball game, we wanted to go over time, so she just told me to get out of the building. The last time my @CAPS1 was patient was when we were in the subway and I ordered a can and it took about a minute to tell I got my food and I was too hungry to fall. So while my @CAPS1 has patience.
When we walked into the smell of mouthwash, the nose went to the front desk and we were taken aback by a small lady with a small stature, hair and glasses. "@CAPS1 sit down, writing ranill, your dentist will be with you soon." Ms. @CAPS2 kle:li. We made our way to the waiting room and my mom and brother sat in the waiting carriage while I sat in the little brown tea in the corner. My brother got some paper and crayons while my mom got a ???. But am I wrong, my mom and my brother are still doing the same thing when I look around the room and my mom and my brother are still doing the same thing? I keep asking my mom when the dentist is coming, but @CAPS4 just told me to be patient. After about twenty minutes, I was lost to @CAPS3 and I can't anymore? ? ? Not sure how my brother can sit there and color the twenty minuet. I wanted to ask my mom when the dentist was coming, but @CAPS4 would just tell me to be patient. I got up and started pacing back and forth. Five minutes later, my mom asked me to sit down and find something to do. But when I'm going crazy, there's nothing I can do that can make me happy. “@CAPS3 has an appointment for you.” @CAPS4 @CAPS2 I got up and followed her to a small room, glad the wait was over
Patience is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to wait patiently for a lot of things, like long speeches, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, what you've been waiting for just doesn't happen and you have to leave without doing what you wanted to do (this has happened to me many times). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to wait patiently for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want cake. But yes, you have to wait until your annoying sister is done blowing out the candle and making a wish. I'm part of an orchestra and we have an orchestra about every two months @ORGANIZATION1. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, they are usually in @NUM1. Last year was @NUM2. At the end of @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheesecake sampling station, along with cookies, domus and all these good cakes. But first I have to do it by playing many clips, watching beginners play and watching honid videos??? Record my face and wait for a bug so any nasty people can laugh at it and call me an "epic failure" . But I am still alive. It's not bad to play this piece, it's just a few sheets of annotated paper, it can be torture for beginners to read, but at least I don't have to play it. Video @CAPS1? It doesn't hurt at all. Who said I'd screw it up? All I had to do was sit in the back row and my mom probably couldn't even see me. My sisters might not even care. Then soon came the cheesecake, like the night @NUM3. This is the good part, but to get to the good part, I have to be patient. I'm not really looking forward to this year's @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1 because I have my last cross country race after school that day. All five middle schools have gathered in one place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2 for a large district meeting. After that meeting, my parents had to take me to @ORGANIZATION1 in high school at @TIME1. @ORGANIZATION1 closed at @NUM4 as usual, I hope I don't do any homework. But if I do, I just have to be patient. That day was like any old day. @NUM5. I have to wait until school is over, parties are over, @ORGANIZATION1 is over to go home, but I can live. My idea is to be patient through the school year without screwing up or failing.
Although you @MONTH1 don't know @CAPS1, we have patience all around us, you @MONTH1 don't even know you use your patience as a winch or write something, but you are. This is a story. When I use patience. One day, on the hotter @DATE1 day, we decided to go to the water park. We jumped in the first pool as soon as we got there and I was waiting for my dad. After playing for a while, we decided to go to a well @CAPS1 is a well in the park. @CAPS1 is too big, you have to take @NUM1 flights to get to @CAPS1, but after I go back I know @CAPS1 is worth the wait
My story is about when I (@DATE1) had patience. I'm waiting for "@CAPS1" to arrive. I'm patient as we're going to @LOCATION2. I can't wait to go, but I remember being "patient". The less I think about it, the faster time flies. Then it came and it was time to head to "@LOCATION2" when I was in the car on the road and couldn't wait! More and more roads are passed. We go from city to city; state to state. It's already day two and I still can't wait. On a long trip I woke up and fell asleep and we were already there. I had to be patient as the drive from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 was a long one. While being patient, I saw a lot and traveled across different states.
Patience is something most people don't have. In the story, patience is what I need. If I didn't have the patience for this story, I don't know what I would do. This is my story. A few years ago, I was picked up by the school. My mom is supposed to take me home, but she wants to go to the grocery store first. While we were there, she asked me if I wanted to come in. Considering all the reasons I didn't want to come in, of course I declined. I sit in the car when there are at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. I was sweating after waiting ten minutes in the car. My mom hasn't left the store yet. There were many times I wanted to be angry, but I didn't allow myself to be like this. I even saw people going in and out before my mom left the store. It took at least two hours for my mom to finally come out, I wasn't mad at her, I just understood her reason and apologized for her lateness. I'm not a patient person most of the time. In fact, I've never had the patience for this situation. I'm glad I have patience with this story.
Sometimes in the days when I have @CAPS1 patience with @CAPS2, I have to control myself so I don't get mad at someone or say something completely mean to them! It's like @DATE1 is actually going to camp at @LOCATION2. We always go for a hike of about one to two hours. When we do, we'll go to the @LOCATION1 lake, but before that, we'll do an "adventure hike," so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods, over and even across rivers. But you can do it two ways; hike five minutes straight to Lake @LOCATION1, or hike one to two hours through woods and logs. In the days when I have @CAPS1 patience with @CAPS2 and just want to go straight to @LOCATION1 lake, we always have to take a long detour! When we got to the lake everyone hated because I would just complain and complain more! (@CAPS3 I get mad at myself sometimes!) @CAPS4 After we went to @CAPS5 for a cold water swim, the way back was more fun! (@CAPS3 My dad said it cleared my mind! But it didn't!) When we got back, we were ready for dinner, but dinner wasn't ready. @CAPS4 I'm in a bad mood... again! And have to wait a while longer!
My two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted by @LOCATION3 two years ago. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years to see her picture and start doing paperwork. The people in the orphanage are not fair to them. A year later, after my aunt and uncle tried adoption, they let almost NUM1 people try adoption first. They had to walk all the way from where they lived to @LOCATION3, aka @LOCATION1, and wait three days to see her. The orphanage told them to wait another week to adopt her. In the end, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They dealt with more paperwork, said they would take care of her the whole time, and went home. After that, @PERSON1 didn't sleep at all for the first week or so. Because @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2. She sleeps during the day and wakes up at night, and they eventually teach her to sleep at night. It took a lot of patience for the girl, but she was eventually adopted.
The time I have patience is the last time @DATE1 we went to Cedar Point. When we got to Cedar Point there was a long line and when we got to the front of the line the machine broke. @CAPS1 We had to go to another ride and I can't wait @CAPS1 because I had to go to the bathroom @CAPS1 I walked out of the line and went to the bathroom. When I got back there were more people in line @CAPS1 and I just waited.
My dad @PERSON1 is patient every day. He goes to work and doesn't want to go home, but he doesn't go crazy like me because I want to leave. No, he does his job and waits until @NUM1 he can leave and go home. He always waits patiently until @NUM1. My dad has always been a patient man and respected him for that patience.
I was at the great wolf house and we couldn't go in because there was some kid poo in the pool and a good part of the pool was brown and we couldn't go in for three hours and it was boring and then we went out and there was a holeshot there .
There was one time I was patient, I've been patient many times, but the one I remember most is when I was waiting for my friends to come home from school (I missed school) and I did a lot. I played my Xbox @NUM1 and then I got on the computer. But when I saw a friend of mine go online, I saw the Xbox. He lives at @CAPS1. Moore @CAPS2. We played most of the time after he came online and then I got off and watched @CAPS3 because I was bored. There was nothing so I turned on the computer and was still bored. So I tried taking a nap, to no avail. After that, I tried to play my Xbox, but after another hour (now about @TIME1), it got boring. I played another half hour or so until I just logged back into my account while listening to the music and played some more until he came online. we played all day till night
My friend @PERSON1 was patient in the lunch line last week, he waited about @NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria before many other students lined up. He is behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 raters. @PERSON1 was patient, didn't cut in front of them and didn't follow the rules. The line was longer because there was a demo, then lunch, and the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders hadn't had lunch yet, so that's why @PERSON1 had to wait. I think he did a great job with @CAPS2 waiting. I reserved a seat next to me for @PERSON1 when many students filled the table. @PERSON1 finally had lunch and I saw him walk up to @CAPS1 and the milk cooler to grab an orange @CAPS1. I waved to him from across the room and he saw me. When he came to sit next to me, I told him he was doing well @CAPS2 patiently waiting for his lunch. I was almost out of macaroni and cheese when @PERSON1 said "@CAPS3 hold my seat for me". When we were all done, we packed up our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We're glad we didn't have to be in that loud, crowded cafe. In the gym, other kids are playing a small game of basketball. @PERSON1 grabbing basketball. I waited until @NUM2 ground up, I was patient, then the teacher told the younger students to go back to class and when I got the ball I asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to travel the world. This is one of @PERSON1's, my favorite games we play.
Prosperity! Prosperity! I know my cousins are at the door because they are all clumsy. So I ran down the stairs and opened the door, and it turned out to be them. Then, we all got in the van you all read to play my mom and we replied @CAPS1!!!" The van was noisy, but I had to be patient. After that, we got to Ohio and we stopped to buy Some food. After @NUM1 mins, we got into the van. We were all excited when we arrived??? A little, I thought it was going to be a good day, but I also knew it would take some time and patience. Next, when None of us went directly to the rapporteur when we entered the park. It was an hour and a half, right. It was going to take a lot of patients, so we waited while we got on and off, and we realized it was worth it. They we rode a lot .. but the best is the diagnostics. When we got to the van, we all said it was fun. Then I thought I was patient
One day my friend @CAPS1 and I are going to @CAPS2 to Alabama. This is the most boring thing about @CAPS3! Imagine just driving @NUM1 hours in the car, just driving and stopping to go to the toilet. To make matters worse, I have the smallest bladder I can imagine @CAPS4! But we did count the waffles, because the further south you go, the more waffle-loving people there are. I'm not kidding, at least one waffle? ? ? . Another one? ? ? We're not just going to Alabama, we're going to @CAPS5 in Alabama. So when we finally? ? ? ? ? ? Still waiting @NUM2 hours. But when we finally got there, we had a blast! I have to admit that a good thing comes from experience? ? ? The rides don't bother us? ? ? ? ? ?
I'm going to tell you a time when I was patient. My cousin is at my house and needs help with his math homework. Since no one was at home, I had to help him. We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn't know what to do. So I had to sit there and teach him what to do and then explain how I got the answer. Did I mention he has three pages to do. It took almost two hours before we did it all. That's when I have to be patient.
@CAPS2 Dad recently lost his job. It's hard. It happens to have @NUM1 since @CAPS2 dad has a job. @CAPS2 Dad has been applying for jobs all the time. But he didn't give up. He kept trying and trying. Luckily the @CAPS2 dad had a job interview at san @CAPS1 a few weeks after he was leaving. Hope he gets the job. Thank goodness @CAPS2 dad is very patient. Despite his constant rejection, he still worked very hard to find a job. @CAPS2 Dad is my role model for @CAPS2 because he has amazing patience. Thank god I have someone to take care of me and he is as patient as a @CAPS2 father. The @CAPS2 family would have survived without the patience of @CAPS2's father. Work or not, I will always love @CAPS2 dad. This is true because @CAPS2's father is very patient. For this main reason, here's why @CAPS2 dad will always be @CAPS2's hero and beloved first role model
Patience is a very difficult thing @CAPS1 Some people. Once, I was at a big party. But none of my friends or cousins were there. I've been boarding. I asked my mom if we could go home and she said "no". Then I sat down and waited a long time for @CAPS1. Then we finally went home. The next day, my mom dropped me off at my cousin's house @CAPS1 for a nap. This is because I am patient at parties. I learned that patience is not always a bad thing. When you are patient, you will receive good.
Melay is a little girl waiting for her parents in the @CAPS1 bush. @CAPS5 Not sure why @CAPS5 has to do this. Her parents have been in pain right now. " @CAPS2 must be me," @CAPS5 thought. Her sister is not as patient as @CAPS5. @CAPS5 must be doing something all the time. So @CAPS5 wasn't happy when her parents didn't come and others came. The boys came down the road @CAPS6 @CAPS14 took @NUM1 to hide. Melay was thinking, "These boys are waiting on the street. @CAPS14 gone crazy!" @CAPS3 Their parents told them to hide @CAPS2 there was always a good reason. @CAPS5 sat on @CAPS13 thinking about it when @CAPS5 heard a bang! "@CAPS4 is like that" thought @CAPS5. @CAPS5 looking at @CAPS6 her sister should be, @CAPS5 not @CAPS13. " @CAPS6 is @CAPS5?" @CAPS7 @CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 boy soldier standing and laughing. " Has @CAPS4 been mocked by @CAPS14?" @CAPS5 took a closer look and realized that @CAPS2 is her sister. "@CAPS10!" @CAPS5 shouted. "@CAPS6 are my parents, @CAPS14 should be here now," thought @CAPS5. The Boy Scouts were walking towards her. That's when @CAPS5 saw two other married and exhausted corpses. @CAPS5 found out that @CAPS2 is her parent. @CAPS5 is up and running. escape tragedy. @CAPS5 made @CAPS2 a mile before @CAPS5 had to hide. @CAPS5 Hiding in the bushes. Boy soldiers walked around looking for her. Suddenly someone shouted: "@CAPS13 @CAPS5 yes!" @CAPS14 dragged her out of the bushes and walked for what seemed like forever for @CAPS4. Finally @CAPS14 reached the build. Mele yells to herself, "@CAPS3 I'm the only one waiting. @CAPS3 I'm the only one waiting. @CAPS14 took her into a room where the boss raped her @CAPS14 quickly shot her and then put her Drag into the trash. @CAPS3 only @CAPS5 waits.
I remember this hot @DATE1 day on my way to @CAPS1/octhndontist. /Leave school because it was a lost day for the next day, I left school about forty-five minutes @CAPS2. My picks are @CAPS3 @CAPS4-30. So / @CAPS5 @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 lifteen @CAPS4 is about @CAPS4 and @CAPS3 and me. So / @CAPS11 and @CAPS4 - passed the first time, so I crossed the street and ordered @PERSON1 @CAPS14. After @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14. I bought the same gum, now @CAPS15. I'm still waiting, I go to @CAPS16 @CAPS17, front desk manager, how long will it take me to get in. Said she would check on me. She came back and she told me I could move on. I'm so glad I was so patient, and I'm breaking my teeth for being patient!
The times when I have to be patient are when I need help with my homework. My dad is smart, so whenever I need help, I usually turn to him. Well, I'm at @TIME1 and my dad is out of school at @TIME2 so if I need his help, I'm going to have to wait for myself, but I don't get it. Even before my dad gets home, I have homework that needs help in my backpack, and I want homework that doesn't need help. After I've done all my @CAPS1 homework, it's time to eat because I'm having dinner. By then I had done the work of waiting for my dad, more and really helping us as my dinner. This is the last time to wait for my dad to help understand it.
Once upon a time there was a lonely puppy. One day he mailed the letter to a random address and waited, waited, waited. A few weeks later, he got a reply from another puppy! They quickly became best friends, and the pup learned that the patient would be rewarded (ussaly). @CAPS1
On @DATE1, my friend @CAPS1 and I boarded the bus to @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I are with our church community and we are together until @NUM1 o'clock. We ride all the different rides all day and we line up for @CAPS4. The sign on the front says "Wait @NUM2 hours from this @CAPS3", but we're going to wait for it to come out. I was around @NUM3 at the time so we could ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started @NUM5pm and luckily we were standing next to the haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm we were all bored so we played different mobile games like Slideshow and Lemonade. Every five minutes or so we hear screeching screams, and we can always hear the mouth running, like a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got in the car and we all loved it. When we got out of the car, someone said "@CAPS5 continue @CAPS6" and all adults love the idea. As we walked past, I could smell sweets and taste an elephant's ear on my tongue. Little did we know we had to pass @CAPS7. Caenevil is full of evil clowns and other spooky creatures. Not a good idea considering half of us are afraid of clowns. When we got to @LOCATION1, there was a long line, but it only took forty-five minutes. The ride is over and the boy hits my head multiple times on my headrest and my head hurts. On the way to the exit, we saw more creepy directions. We found out later that we had been in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and went home. I learned that day that I was more patient than I thought.
When I'm patient is when we go on vacation. Seems like I've been waiting to go to @LOCATION1, it's actually only been a month or so. I'm excited, but I have to be very patient. Sometimes it's hard for me to be patient because I like to do things right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 is very difficult for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn't sleep at all. I was so excited the day we left, I ran around the house yelling. Finally we loaded up the car and headed out to @LOCATION1. We drove there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it's worth it, @LOCATION1 is really fun and beautiful. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had a great time. I had to be patient at @ORGANIZATION1 as we had to wait a while because of the long queue for the rides. I had so much fun at @LOCATION1!
Everyone uses patience sometimes in life. I have to use it every day. I need it to play basketball. There may be many reasons why some people need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular. My first is when people don't pay attention. This frustrates me. When team members are lazy, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. anger. She either told us to stop it or made us run a few laps in the gym. My first reason led to my second. The second thing that bothers me is that when people aren't paying attention, they get lost and have no idea what's going on. There are a lot of people that take a long time to catch up. My second leads to my third. My third is when someone is new to the team. The other day we only needed new people to join and the season is half over. _ _ _ The newest member of the team cannot be shot. She didn't go all out. Only @ NUM2 people out of @NUM3 or @NUM4 people are actually good. Check out my dissertation, all of which I have to be patient with. If I'm not, I'll be in trouble, which means my sportsmanship will be poor. I deal with it and live with it all. _ _ Over the years, I have learned to be patient. I also learned to be patient. I'm glad I know what to do now, otherwise where would I be? Probably not in any team or any club.
I remember being patient at one time, just being there waiting for the doctor to call my name was a little difficult. But I went through it. After waiting @NUM1 minutes, I'm not going to be offended that this lady hasn't called my name yet. I just turned on my @NUM2 player and listened to my music while reading a magazine. Before I knew it, @CAPS2 called my name, "@CAPS1" @CAPS2 laughed. So I got up and walked to the room @CAPS2 directed me to. As I left the doctor's office and moved on, I thought, "Maybe patience isn't that bad after all!"
Almost every time you are at the doctor or hospital, you need to be patient. When I pass the time at the doctor, all I do is play my spy. I always play with my mom. There are usually a lot of people seeing the doctor when I go. There are magazines, but I think they are boring. So I play the spy game to be patient. Otherwise I'd be very, very bored.
@NUM1. Last year, I had to go to the doctor on my birthday. So when I got home from school I left. When we got there, we had to wait in the lobby. There were crying babies everywhere and we had to go to the movies and do some shopping. @NUM2. There are many people in front of me. I started to get angry. Finally, they called my name. I'm glad I don't know what to do.
When someone was patient it was a guy named @PERSON2 driving, a little girl named @PERSON1 was walking on the sidewalk and the red light was on. She shouted "Old Man" , the old man was gone, she sent him to the store, she asked what was that, @PERSON2 selling nothing. No, you tried to hit me, you came at me, so I went. @PERSON1 said to @PERSON2 that I am relaxed or patient. @PERSON2 tell her to learn how to control the inside line.
"@CAPS1!" @CAPS2 whimpered, her voice escalating to a wail. "You can't do this to me. I'm ten!" "@CAPS2, calm down. I know you're ten and a very sensitive ten. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I told you before, I can't put you Stay home @DATE1. Your dad and I have jobs darling!" "@CAPS4 can't you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitting last year!" @CAPS2's mom sighed. "I know you like @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just doesn't fit what I'm looking for. Also, you @CAPS21 you want to be a nanny! Why not try to help at @CAPS16?" @CAPS2 with her skilled glare Her mother @CAPS21 "@CAPS7 If!". This conversation took place two weeks ago in the Fuller's kitchen. @CAPS12, @CAPS2's mother @PERSON1 is taking her to @CAPS9 County's only daycare @CAPS10 & @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name makes @CAPS2 want to gag. "@CAPS12 Remember darling, be nice and try to help. I love you!" @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building reads "@CAPS10 & @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment" @CAPS13 has that sickening feeling again. @CAPS13 Turn around to see if @CAPS13 can spot her mother's red, battered @LOCATION1 speeding up the paved road. @CAPS4 All @CAPS13 sees is dust. Great, @CAPS13 thinks @CAPS7 @CAPS13 enters through double doors with a picture of a laughing clown, "@CAPS12 why don't you play with little @PERSON4?" @PERSON2 @CAPS21, in her arms Comforting "little" @PERSON4, actually, @PERSON4 is seven and @CAPS2 thinks it's old enough to not cry when someone asks them to play "one" and when someone yells at them ten billion times. "@CAPS2 we need to talk." @CAPS21 middle-aged woman, steer clear of @PERSON4, "Honey, you have to understand that kids need patience and love. Oops, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy, you're a catcher Man!" @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 yelled regretfully. @CAPS13 smiles and goes to @PERSON4. Maybe he's still your game.
I was patient enough to get my phone. I had to be extra special so my mom could decide when I got my phone. It was @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was being patient so my mom would think it was time for me to get a new phone. When I got home, I acted like a lovable little angel. But she still didn't say it's time to pick up the phone @TIME1 @DATE3 I did the same but better. I still don't get it, I want to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day @DATE1 I made some breakfast for my mom and I am happy to get my phone today. No, she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face, she was waiting for me to yell, but I knew what she wanted to do, so I said you were welcome, even though I was feeling nervous. Next time @TIME1 I'm feeling better, I'm ready to improve my patience, so I dress professionally\casual, I make my own breakfast, I'm ready to impress, I'm walking to school . When I got home my mom got up and she said "@CAPS1 I have to take you to get something" house and I wonder if my mom said "wait @CAPS2" and I still want to know watching her enter the house . She came out and gave me the brown county where I stayed at a friend's house. I was so desperate and now my smile turned into a smirk. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I am doing my homework. @DATE5 Last day of the week. I do nothing but mop the floor. But I'm still very patient. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friend's house. @DATE4 When I got up to go to school, my mom was already up and she said "@CAPS2 you can get your phone now, I hugged her tightly and ran out the door eagerly to try it out.
While I'm patient, I'm patient with @CAPS1. I had to open presents at 9:30 in the morning and I had to wait and wait. So I watched TV for two hours. I though @CAPS2 will be hard @CAPS4 I pass @CAPS2. @CAPS1 I think the funniest @CAPS4 I lied, I think this year will be. I made breakfast in bed that day. I actually had a lot of fun. I bought some purfoom for my mom. @CAPS4 Of course she doesn't use them, I have I bought her some candles and we bought my dad a bright orange sweatshirt. We also gave him some @PERSON1.
Once my family and I were at @CAPS1 on @DATE1. My sister really wanted to play all the little kiddie rides with me, but I didn't like it. I want to go to one of the fastest and highest rides out there. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It looked really cool, so my dad and I ran to the entrance, but when we got them, the wait time on the blackboard was an hour and forty-five minutes. I really want to continue this ride, but it's really not worth standing on that line. So when the lines started moving and we were halfway through them, the sign said @NUM1 mins. I told my dad maybe we should do it another day. But my dad said we'd be in a trough soon, and he told me to just watch the people above and don't talk. We only moved a little, @NUM1 minutes, so my dad said maybe we should do it another day, and we left the line to find my mom and sister.
I was patient once when my dad said he was going to send me a letter every @DATE1 as he was staying away from me to visit him, he has been living at @LOCATION1. He told me I had to be patient because I'm not really patient tipping. I guess patience is not that hard. In order for me to be patient, I have to do something so I can rest myself by writing stars and drawing, reading, going anywhere near my mother's house and helping our animals. When he finally came, I didn't even get it. Milk @DATE2 so I had to wait a bit longer in there, I guess while sitting you just have to pay attention to the things you have to be patient with.
At one point I was patient, really patient, but kind of like that. It's @CAPS1, my mom and I go shopping for gifts. So I went to the mall with my mom and walked into Target and I already knew what I was going to buy for my brother and the new game @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 was perfect. But my mom wouldn't let me buy it so I bought him a Target gift card @MONEY1 I had to hide it for almost a month but I really want to know what my mom bought for me and my brother , but she won't stop telling me, so I'll have to be patient. I was so surprised when @CAPS1 came out because my mom bought @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 for me and my brother.
Once my friend @PERSON1 was very patient, he waited for @NUM1 months for the Xbox @NUM2 games @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. He quietly waited for the game day in and day out. But one day the game came after school.
Patient player. One time, when I was four, my sister was two, and I was playing basketball, and my sister always wanted what I had, and we were always fighting about something, so my sister came over and grabbed my ball, and when we fought When my mom told me to stand and let her hold the ball, she would walk away. So I just stood there patiently and waited. My sister was so bored she threw the ball away, she did exactly what my mom said, and then when I was playing basketball again, she ran over to catch it, so I went in and played video games.
When I have to go check my asma, or in the familiar way I'm waiting in the waiting room, if the doctor hasn't called your name, then I have a lot to do. So I kept myself busy with crossword puzzles and looked at all those great fish because they have different kinds of fish. Then I read my book most of the time because I'm both a reader and a writer but when the doctor finally came in and called my name I read my book most of the time but I was still busy with activities and then He said he was sorry for waiting for a while, he just said it was fine and he saw everything I did while I was waiting. He said I was a very patient good girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so that I could get good compliments and it was really nice to have a smile on my face. He has always given me a treat or babysitting since I saw that exact doctor with my appointment. But to me it doesn't really matter as long as I'm generally fine with treating others fairly. Because people want to be as patient as you someday.
It was really fun when my mom @PERSON1 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 Because I want a lot of things my family can't afford, my mom is very patient. I guess she's just naturally patient. I just don't know how she did it. Anyway, in the whole store, it's quite large. There are two floors high! My mom was a little mad at me because I was mad at her all the time. @CAPS1 She tried not to show how angry she was in the store even though she was really mad When we went to @ORGANIZATION1 that night, we got everything we needed. The next day, we had to put up bedside tables. @CAPS1 I really want my dad to build our new bunk bed. @CAPS1 My mom said he probably couldn't do it that day. I was almost telling my dad to make our bed. @CAPS1 It's time I was fed @CAPS1 and my mom is mad at me for wanting to sleep in bed that night.
When I had the patience it was @DATE1 and we drove to @LOCATION1. It's been a long journey. It was a long time because he had a long way to go to the nagshion of Six Flags and our hotel. I try not to complain and be patient because the ride is a full day, so that means almost a day of sitting! We got lost in @LOCATION1 for almost an hour looking up and down for our upcoming buffer. I had to search, but no space. I want to go out and run and jump, but I have to be patient. It's @NUM1 in the morning and I'm tired. We still have to find our hotel, forever! At the hotel, I was unpacking my stuff and noticed that I had almost a day of patience, although I would never be able to do that in the car. That's when I'm patient.
Not long ago I went to the pumpkin patch with my mom, sister, grandma, aunt, uncle, my @NUM1 year old niece and little cousin. When we were done, we went to a restaurant for dinner. After waiting for the waitress @NUM2 minutes, she came over and just told us she'd be "@CAPS1" with us. So we waited half an hour to put our drink order in. When we finally ordered our food, it took them an hour to bring it.
Will I be patient and wait for my little sister to arrive that morning @DATE1? I'm so excited. I'm not a very patient person, so it's hard for me to sit still when it comes to this. Waiting for my turn to hold her was difficult, but when she was in my arms, that was what my life had to be an amazing feeling. It's always hard to leave her when she calls your name, like I want to cry. I don't always go home and see a little girl say my name, but I love every minute of what I do. I always wait patiently to see her again, but if you know what I mean, it's hard.
At @CAPS1's office. I have an @CAPS2 appointment. In the @CAPS2 office, I was in the room waiting for her to come back. Then @CAPS1 asked me questions and my foster mother. Then she left, she went to another @CAPS1 and talked to him. Then they come back and say @CAPS4 you. Here are the files you need. The adoptive mother said ok @CAPS4 you. And then @CAPS1 said to me, "@CAPS4 you be patient @PERSON1. I know this very well," "@CAPS5 I'll see you next time, okay." @CAPS5 We said "bye."
A patient person is one who tolerates life. If you are impatient, you will not be able to accept it. I learned this at a very young age. There was something I wanted and I was about to drive me but just before I could walk out the door the phone rang. My @CAPS2 picked up, "@CAPS1 oh hi, @PERSON1 isn't busy, @CAPS6 isn't! No!" It went on for a long time, and every minute I got more and more impatient, I finally broke out . "@CAPS2 @CAPS3' @CAPS4 @CAPS5!" @CAPS6 said, "Wait @PERSON1, I'm on the phone, I'm not taking you now!" and walked away. That' @CAPS4 why patients matter
At @DATE1 time, my mom plans to let us go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. We're on our way to the airport, okay? Tried to work through traffic but we couldn't. So my mom started yelling and I told her to calm down and we'd make it. So finally we got to the airport and it was a lot of people so we had to rush and finally we got to the airport and I taught my mom to be patient and you'll get it. So finally we arrive at @LOCATION1.
I was patient one time, and when I was at the dentist's office, I had to pull out six teeth. While we were waiting, I kept asking my mom "when are we going and when are we going". When saying "@CAPS1", I wake up and enter the room. I asked if I would get hurt and they said you wouldn't fall. "The doctors put a tube in my mouth and said close my eyes and breathe. Didn't even know I fell asleep from the gas. I fell asleep for two hours and when I wanted to get out of the chair they said 'No, No no" so I sat and they didn't let me out until @NUM1 mins later I was dizzy and had to be in a wheelchair. Got to the front desk and they asked me to get two toys my mom gave me The wrestlers when we were leaving my mom and the doctor said they took forever and when we got in the car my mom came back in a wheelchair where did we go. While riding my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day, Because of my teeth. She said don't look in the mirror but I did and it was grass. I had to wait three hours for food and drink d so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat, I was happy. I Still have the patience as the doctor said the teeth will come in a few months but it's been 2 years and nothing so I'm disappointed but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to the bcacies and it's going to hurt.
I'm heading to the @CAPS1 office on a beautiful day @DATE1. I am not happy. I don't want my son to go there. But it does. When we went in, my mom went to the boarding aisle where I just sat down. When my mom was done, she sat next to me and we waited. We waited and waited. We waited about @NUM1 minutes until @CAPS1 called us. When we entered his office, a nurse came in and checked my temperature, temperature, eg. We waited and waited when she was done and left. We sat there for @NUM2 minutes before @CAPS1 came in. When he was done, we checked out and left, @CAPS2 didn't have to go there again.
When I was in grade with @NUM1 I had to set up a mible setup and then I went to setup the mible setup and it broke and then we went to the park and I had to drink water for the shag and after that went to the ice factory , I had to line up and then when we got there we pard them munem and axyer and we started making ice. And then that's all we did, he went back in the house that day and built the mible mirne and that art was outside the house inside the house
Neither my friends nor I want to ride a new car in the @CAPS1 font. The trip made the cat feel cold. Is this the water ride we've come to expect? If it continues for @NUM1 hours or more. After that we move on. It's interesting.
In @LOCATION2, an early @TIME1 of @LOCATION1 I finished the @ORGANIZATION1 skating competition. I'm waiting to hear if I participated in the @DATE1 part of the event. I've completed. @TIME1 was seven when we left the rink. We went for a bite to eat and then went back to the rink. My best friend @PERSON1 also played in the same event I was in. I know she will be on @DATE1, but I don't know if I will. After an endless wait, they were about to call out whoever made it. I kept saying over and over in my head that I got my number. They called @PERSON1's number. I've been waiting for my number to still be called but they never called it. I didn't succeed. I'm disappointed, but there's nothing I can do about it.
@CAPS1, @CAPS1 is a giant life past? ? When you have problems and obstacles that make you a good person. Have @CAPS1 ??? to? ? ? For work that takes a long time, you may have to wait for an example, I have to use @CAPS1 all the time. For all the active things like football, hockey and all that I do, you have to have @CAPS1. As you know, adults probably have more @CAPS1 than teenagers like me. It's like sitting in the curtains with my dad all day long! As he did, it never happened. Now, when I grow up, I wish I could have more @CAPS1 and be able to sit with my dad in front of the blind all day. I also have to say I'm getting better and better with @CAPS1 as my dad preaches and preaches to me @CAPS1, @CAPS2 hopefully when I grow up I can have some good @CAPS1 dads like me.
To be honest I'm not a very patient person, but once I really didn't know how to do it. I'm in line to buy headphones. I love those headphones, they are my favorite blue. So I waited @NUM1 minutes, then @NUM2 minutes, and I forgot the time, but I know it was a long time. Then the cashier got into trouble at the cashier. So I waited longer and longer until someone tried to fix it. Then I had to wait longer. I think I was on that line for over an hour. I really like those headphones, but as much as I want them, I can't wait. I "@CAPS1" left the store with the headphones aside. I was really angry that day. Two weeks later, we were lucky to be back with the headphones right where I left them. Yes!
One day, Mom was really patient. We talk to each other outside. My grandma and grandpa called and asked if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said "yes". So I went to pack some stuff because they had nothing. So when we jumped in the car and turned on the radio, everything was fine. It was fine for five minutes before my subs backed up traffic. I'm fine until I get a test saying my cousins are over there. I'm pissed, but my mom keeps her eyes on the road. I kept screaming that Mommy hurry up but she ignored me. It's like going from one ear to the other. Then I got a text saying football in @NUM1 minutes. He asked me when are you coming? I said "I don't know" of course my brother was already there because he spent @TIME1. This is a bad @TIME1. I also wanted to tell Mom to hurry up, but didn't listen. Then I plan to ignore her. It didn't work because she didn't speak. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I was going to bed forever but I woke up at @NUM3 at the same spot. I am destroyed. I yelled out the window and said "why". Then I went to bed again. I feel like the car is going faster when I sleep. There was no traffic at all until we turned the corner and it was blocked again and again. I asked my mother how long it had been without a reply. So I screamed again and she yelled "here". I look out the window, here we are. I have to play football. Then I heard my mother laughing in the house. I don't know why she doesn't speak. Maybe she wanted to meet her parents. I never found out. That's when my mom was patient.
A while ago my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called "@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2". I just took a good sniper stance. I have a good angle in all directions except one. The good thing about this place is that everyone walks by it walking around in the woods, @CAPS3 usually doesn't require any patience. That was the part where I was wrong. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the guys playing. I aim my weapon and fire, @CAPS4 by the rules he is now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before we saw another player approach us. Then my partner got up and fired at the other player and got hit. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, @CAPS3 I'm safe. The only problem now is that I need a new place to come @CAPS1 @CAPS6 I quickly found one. I waited another twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player, ready to shoot. When I finally got the weapon from the ground, the man was gone. This made me very clear how I was waiting for @CAPS3 and not a single person on my team. I got up and looked for candidates for my team. I'm finding my patience and getting frustrated. "@CAPS7 is anyone here?" I whispered "@CAPS8! I found you @CAPS9!" someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 jumped down the tree. He told me that he had been watching me. He was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. All the while, he waited patiently, shooting everyone one by one.
Once I got a cool @CAPS1 game and it was awesome. My mom said we'd get it on Friday. This is @DATE1 and it's important that she starts work. She came home and said we had a good time. I'm a little pissed. How bats care. But yeah we got the game on the next start day and I can't believe I have the patience
The patent person in my life is my mom. Aicason My mom is very patient because she always drives me to football games. If I need to go there, football practice at a friend's house and elsewhere. She also spends money on our football, hobbies and other things we need or sometimes want. She was never sure, was always kind when sad or angry, and spent a lot of time doing things for us. Also, whenever she's in trouble at school, she helps us with our studies, an example of most of these incidents is that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year, not counting extras like gear, uniforms, and team supplies s things. An example of where she drives us is she even takes about an hour to drive me and my brother to places like cross country, football and basketball, she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I need to She will stay with me in Corey @NUM1 hours to help with the test. Also, whenever I didn't do well in school, she just encouraged me to do better but was still a little discouraged because she wanted me to do well. She also supports me being vegetarian, even though it means making two meals. All in all, my mom is one of the most patient people I know.
The time when other people I knew were patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mother is very busy. She was president of a club called @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about a year or two. But now that she's not the president, she's less busy, but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But no matter the position, she earns more than just money. So she decided to get a job. She started looking for work online and in newspapers. She can't find a job that suits her. She never complained even though she had a hard time finding a job. She was always looking and searching. She was looking for about a year until finally she got a job at @CAPS3.CC where she now teaches computer courses for collage or seniors. If she wanted to, she'd end up with a job she didn't like.
I hate weddings. I love people getting married, but I hate those ceremonies. They are so boring. Especially @CAPS18 long weddings, people who need two hours to stand there after doing nothing, I'm not the most patient person, so that's probably why I hate long weddings. It's a long story about patience. "Do we have to go?" I moaned to @CAPS4 mom. "@CAPS1 is @PERSON1's wedding and it's a big deal." "@CAPS2." I had to surrender when I got into the car in my new @CAPS4 clothes. The wedding is all @LOCATION1. It usually only takes an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way away when he was in heavy traffic. "@CAPS3 ON!" @CAPS4 sister shouted. I just keep silent. Finally, when the traffic jam dissipated, the drama had just broken out. The road we have to go is closed. There are so many shortcuts. We just entered the town next to @LOCATION1. When we got a call from grandma @CAPS4. "@CAPS5?" @CAPS4 mom replied. "Is that you @CAPS7? The ceremony just ended," "@CAPS8. That sucks. We're at @LOCATION2, why? Did you host @CAPS9?" "@CAPS10, but I'm sure you'll be there in time," " @CAPS11. That's good. @CAPS12." "@CAPS12." @CAPS13, like on us, he arrives at the reception. Even though I hate weddings, I'm happy to be there. "@CAPS14 you have @CAPS16?" @CAPS4 mom asked as we got home. "@CAPS16? I ask." @CAPS17, I think I'm @CAPS14, and even the ride is a bit like @CAPS16. " "@CAPS18? You are often not that kind of patient. " @CAPS1" I said, I'm proud.
We had a garage sale and a mom-to-mom sale a few weeks ago. When we had to wait for people to come to our table, I had to be patient because of drive-by customers or mom-to-mom sales. During the garage sale, I had a lemonade sale. We made a lot of money between these two sales, but we still had to take something home to donate. The sale is fun, but we have to go through it all and price it. So we just sit there, but sometimes I'm happy because people buy stuff we're having fun doing mom-to-mom sales and garage sales! I think we made beautiful gods! We do sell a few things, but some of them we still pack and take home to donate. We had to do a lot of work, but I absolutely love it!
A long time ago, when I was in third grade, I had a friend @PERSON2 whose mom was in a bad mood. She never smiles, and she never smiles. Every time I see her, I smile at her and she just frowns and keeps walking. At first I didn't know she was a grumpy person, I just thought she didn't like me or something. I started laughing when @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grumpy one. He asked me what was funny and I told him I thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I saw his mom I would smile at her and she would just frown and walk away. This made my friend laugh, we tried so hard that we had trouble in class. The next day @PERSON2 and I had lunch at school and he said to me <hey, you're good at making people laugh>. I said <no, I'm not my joke is scary>. He said <@CAPS1 let them test newcomers to this school>. I said @CAPS1 so we went all over the school looking for a new student and unfortunately we couldn't find one and we ran to our class when we heard the bell. We sat in the only @PERSON2 at the back of the classroom and an empty seat between me and us. We are excited because our teacher @PERSON1 is going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 came to the front of the classroom and class today I have an announcement that a new student in our class is saying hi to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walks through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 she could sit in the back between @PERSON2 and me. She sat down and turned to greet both of us. @PERSON2 gave me a look and said to tell her the joke, @CAPS3 he gave a thumbs up. I turn to @LOCATION1 and say hi, I'm @CAPS4, do you want a joke? @ORGANIZATION1 said yes. I started <@CAPS5 knocking her saying <who was there I said <booshe said <booshe who? I said <don't cry I'm here>. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't understand, but in the middle of the movie she said "Oh, I see, she started laughing. @PERSON2 turned to me and said <I told you so>. @PERSON2 had a crazy idea, if I Overnight at his house so I can make his mom laugh, or at least make her laugh. I said <@CAPS1 sounds like a plan>. I asked mt mom if she was @CAPS1 and if I could spend the night at @PERSON2's house , she said <yes, just make sure it's @CAPS1 with his mom>. @PERSON2 asked his mom and she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2's house, the first thing we did was play Video games. At dinner time, we all sat at the table for @PERSON2, me on one side, his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell his parents the joke, I said @CAPS1. So I said to them <@CAPS5 @CAPS5> and they replied <who was there I said <boothey said <shh who? I said <don't cry I'm here>. His parents started laughing and they laughed about five Minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled that it worked, his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told us her mom passed away recently and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner, We just went to bed. When my mom came to pick me up the next morning, she asked how I was sleeping. I said I was funny and funny. She said @CAPS1, but laughter doesn't help you clean The room, all I can say is it's terrible. Fins
Softball has to be one of the greatest sports. Playing softball in college has always been my goal. I love the dirt clinging to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallon after gallon of water you splash all over trying to stay cool in the blistering @CAPS2. As much as I love softball, I think the memories you get from your time with your teammates are the most memorable things about your softball career. I've always had a lot of good memories through softball, a lot of laughter, tears and frustration, so when I get the chance to play on a top-notch team, I'm looking forward to having many more. Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is my team name and I played on this local team for almost four years. Many of these girls are like sisters to me, and they've been very nice to me during the years I've played with them. I feel like I have my own regular team and I'll play with these girls in high school and we'll get closer. As I was about to enter my fifth year, I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that I might play for a team that wasn't quite local, it was also very tempting. I'm in a big dilemma right now, either stay with the teams I know well and keep playing with them until I graduate high school; or play with the teams I know nothing about and play with girls who may not like me , play with girls who are much better than me, and look down on me. When I looked at the pros and cons of both teams, I decided no; I would stay with the team I know very well, and I would stay comfortable where I am. Softball was just around the corner and I started to reanalyze everything. Do I really want to stay comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to be a better player; maybe I can work hard and get college scouts to look at me and hopefully I can play for them later. Then I decided I would take the opportunity to work hard for this team. My stomach got a knot as my dad and I drove to the venue where I was going to try out for this team. I hope this team likes me and I do everything I can to say hello to them so I don't come across as snobby or grumpy. Time flies, and I wish it were slower; my heart feels like it's beating a million times a second. I was so nervous that my mouth started to get sticky and had a weird taste, shortly after my mouth became dry, no taste, no taste, just a sticky mess. Then the car stopped and my dad looked at me and just said "ready or not we're coming". Nerves started to take over my body, my arms were shaking uncontrollably, my every movement was guessing, and I couldn't even unbuckle my seatbelt. As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by and I saw all the girls turn their heads to see what fresh meat was coming up. My first thought was to run; that's it, I don't want to go, I'm done I want to go home I'm ready to start my year with @CAPS2, I just can't take it. Then, when I walked out onto the field, they all laughed. Each of them told me their name, favorite color, and a fun little fact about themselves. I found myself laughing the whole time I tried it, there were no awkward moments and I had a great time there. I can't wait to go back, I've made new friends now, friends I know I'll make. My year with this team has been amazing and I have developed friendships with these girls that I would never have found if I hadn't left. The girls were like family, and the coach even more so. Laughter played a huge role in my decision to join this team, if I just went for it, if I didn't have fun and laugh, I'd decide to play with @CAPS2. @CAPS2 has great memories for me and softball is all about going out and finding new friendships; so enjoy the sport and the people.
Some people like to make people laugh, I do. I would do anything to get a good laugh. I would make fun of myself, do crazy stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was young, I really didn't know how to laugh. For some odd reason, I can never tell whether people are laughing at something or laughing at it. I was a little "special" in some ways as a kid (and I still do today). As a five-year-old, I loved making people laugh, and I was so special that I would do crazier things to make fun of. Mind you, I'm a bit of a rubbish, and a really big rubbish. I am the most active five year old you will ever meet. For example, one time I hit myself on the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing in class with a pencil in hand and stabbed myself in the head with a pencil and needed stitches. One of the craziest moments was when I wanted to go outside a few days before I had to take a photo, and my mom, knowing how "special" I was (I got it from her), wouldn't allow me to do that. I was a persuasive expert at the time, convincing her to let me out. Before I got to the street, I first fell on the corner of the sidewalk, leaving a huge mark that completely ruined the photo. While this might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter, not that I'm a fool. Now that you know I love to make people laugh, I'm "special", and I'm a total idiot, I can get on with the story. Well, I'm in kindergarten and I love going to school because I can hang out with my friends and play with blocks, which may sound stupid, but I'm in kindergarten. The only thing I don't like about kindergarten is the bully. Surprisingly, I've never been bullied except in kindergarten, but this is a bad bully. He would marry me during story time and the whole deal (it was the best time because the teacher couldn't see it). I still know that bully, but he's not a bully anymore, he's a good pair of shoes now, which I think is weird. Anyway, kindergarten has been a really good year for me, except for one day (and every day I have a wedgies). That day is what the whole story is about, that's why I tell you I love to make people laugh, why I tell you I'm "special", and a spaz, everything in the story revolves around this day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. Start like any day in kindergarten. I get up, do my routine, hop in the car, and go to school. When I get to school, I pick up my daily binder and slap the education sign like a mall cop slaps the watch and report sign. I do all my work and color it (which is basically all my work). It was almost time for a break, so we ran around the playground and had a little snack. After we took the last few drops from the juice box, we entered story time. We all listen to stories in small circles (more like a deformed oval), and when I get into it and lose my vigilance, I receive a painful (for a five-year-old) marriage. As the story draws to a close, our five-year-old's attention span is fading and we're all getting excited. The story finally came to an end, we stood up, and that's where my memory started to fade. I told a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class burst into laughter, I was a "special" fool and didn't know if people were laughing at me or crying with me. I remember opening my eyes at the water cooler, trying to hide my tears. A teacher tried to help me by telling me they were watching my jokes. It took me a few minutes to stop crying, but it took me a while to realize they weren't laughing at me. To this day, I'm still reminded of that day by my classmates, and of course I can laugh now, but that was in kindergarten and I'm in ninth grade now, and it's kind of crazy for me to have people remember it. It was a negative experience at the time, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference in laughter and accept when people laugh at me (doing stupid things to make me laugh is actually my forte). So remember, "special" can sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, and what makes people laugh.
"Laughter" @CAPS1 I hang out with friends and one of the things we do best is laughing sometimes for no reason. Things we tend to laugh at are running into the trash, the laundry, maybe even the dinner we had before @TIME1. @CAPS1 I usually emphasize that one of the things I love is hanging out with my friends. They are usually good listeners. comprehensive. Although they take your attention away from things. So spend a good time with my friends whenever and wherever. @CAPS1 When I say trash I really mean trash I remember one time in the hallway at school my friend hung up on my backpack because she used to let me go in the hallway because I was walking more Hurry up, anyway, the class bell just rang, and all the students went to lunch. I was about to walk down the hallway and she said don't do it, so I did one and no one stopped! So she kind of slid into a trash can hanging on the hallway wall and she @MONTH1 dropped it, but I can't really tell? I'm still walking, the sound effects are so funny, I'm still laughing. My friend and I have an inside story? We go out to lunch together. @CAPS1 We saw a laundry buddy and I was crazy, we made up a funny joke that we should make our own aprons with lots of colors and rhinestones so that if we wanted to do all the laundry hours at the same time. There we would undress and put on what we call aprons. Washing our clothes like nothing. @CAPS1 Our clothes are done and we say we can pick a new one because all the clothes are clean. Yes, we're weird, but that's what makes us laugh more, and anything is stupid, like that story. Now it's a bit like laundry about food, but better I guess? I remember @CAPS1 I came to school the next day and I just started talking about what I had for dinner @TIME1 I think my mom asked if we wanted chicken @PERSON1 and my sister because I screamed hell yeah? So dinner was ready @CAPS1, we went to the table at the scene, we looked at it, wasn't that what we expected? It was frozen out of the box and it looked like someone ate the food instead of spitting it out? It was amazing. All these things that have been named or talked about is that my life is pretty much every day @CAPS1 no drama I love my friends I don't think I could ask for a better one because all we do is laugh and have fun in the trash Lockers and anything else, but one of the most important things with a friend of mine is @CAPS1 we got into a fight and we can't keep mad at each other, I can't right now. So at the end of the day, I asked her if we were done with each other? Than we just look at each other and laugh because that's all we can do, because the reasons are so stupid it really isn't necessary. That's how friends have fun with me and not worry about things around us. But just for fun and stupidity. Not someone else but self sometime @CAPS1, are we really stupid? We made up stories about our laundry. Talking to my friends about my life there is nothing better than laughing because deep down inside of you your friends will look back and say wow those best days were @CAPS1 - will meet in class for talking too much to trouble.
Well, let me tell a story about my getting @CAPS3 in town. When I went down town to meet some dead bodies, it was cold, dark, and creepy. So on my way there, I thought I was going a long way, so I took the bus, like is it me? I'm confused as to what to like. Then I asked someone where I was and the guy said you're in the city center and I said I know it's just okay I walked away like uh crazy. So I just called thenm to see if she was ringing and she answered. If you were me, she said I was like oh my gosh I know but never mind she was like some of you I said at the time in downtown. Then she said stupid @CAPS2 on the bus and more down so I waited like @NUM1 and the bus came and I was so happy. Then I called her on the bus to say me and she said ok @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 she said I was laughing and said ok I wouldn't. When I was there @CAPS2 they laughed at me and I was like that wasn't funny and I could be snacked or raped or maybe worse. Well that's what you @CAPS2 they say I'm like yeah yeah I know what lol. Later that night, I didn't seem to want to eat candy, so they showed me @CAPS2 to where the store was, so I was like gone, the last words I heard were @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I laughed. Well, on my way to the store, I was cold, listening to the music listed, then I @CAPS2 went to the store and looked around, and then my phone rang. Hi, I said it was the girl and she said I was just used to letting you not @CAPS3 I said I got it, I wouldn't @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @NUM2 minutes at the end I go out and look around like me? I was like oh no it wasn't like that, I just started going the way I came and didn't see the hose so I went the other way and I was like omg I'm @CAPS3 again? Yes to me. So I didn't want her to know I was @CAPS3 so I didn't call her and tried to find my way but I couldn't so I just thought, then @NUM3 minutes passed and she called. Sooo... darrio she said what i answered hannin she said you @CAPS3 eh? I laughed and no why did you say I asked her like I was looking at you and you went the wrong way and I looked back and laughed. She walked up to me and said you're @CAPS3 I said no, I was just breathing, she was like yes, alright Dario, you're smiling, I'm thinking, next time I'll let her hang out with me When I got up, I laughed. When we got to her house they laughed again and I just said ok I got @CAPS3 and we both laughed for @NUM4 mins and calmed down. Then I thought it was hot in here and then I opened the window and they said it was cold so I was fine, I closed the window and walked outside for a minute. My phone rang and I picked up that girl and said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was like shut up I'm not me on the front porch she said soo...you slow you might @CAPS2 @CAPS3 still I laughed and hung up and Went in and said, we all laughed. And then that cave night was about me getting lost and not knowing I was going, yeah, that's it.
@CAPS3 I'm going to tell @CAPS18 a little story. I remember one time @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I decided to build a snowman at @CAPS11's house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I said to him, I'm bored, what does @CAPS1 @CAPS18 want to do? ” @PERSON1 replied, “@CAPS2 to build a snowman. "@CAPS3 I agree that would be fun. @CAPS34 starts reaching for a jacket @CAPS3 gloves, but I stop him @CAPS3 saying, "@CAPS1 is @CAPS18 getting those?" ""@CAPS5 is not cold @CAPS20. "@CAPS6" in reply to @PERSON1. "@CAPS33 not saying I don't" t warn @CAPS18. "We start our snowman by building the base (the biggest part at the bottom). @CAPS3 The base is almost done in about @NUM1 minutes, but we noticed we were getting cold. "@CAPS7 should we go in?" @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS8, my @CAPS7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate." @CAPS9 We went back inside hoping for some delicious hot chocolate. I saw @CAPS11 mom @CAPS3 asking, "@CAPS10 do we have some hot chocolate?" "@CAPS11 @CAPS18 looks cold, of course I'll make some for @CAPS18." @CAPS9 @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit Downstairs anxiously waiting for our hot chocolate to warm by the heater. "@CAPS5 is ready!" @CAPS11 mom yells from above the stairs. We flew down the lobby @CAPS3 and rushed up the stairs. @CAPS3 To our surprise we found not only hot chocolate but a bag of chips from @CAPS28. "@CAPS14 Mom!" I said. "@CAPS14 @CAPS16 @CAPS17!" @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS18're welcome boy" @CAPS11 mom said. @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sat at the table @CAPS3 started drinking our hot chocolate while @CAPS11 mom put some chips on paper towels for us. I started grabbing fries and @PERSON1 grabbed one, only one. I asked him, "Did @CAPS19 @CAPS18 only catch one @PERSON1?" @CAPS20 out of the corner of his eye @CAPS34 watched as @CAPS3 slowly brought the chip to his mouth and @CAPS3 took a bite. As @CAPS34 did, I fell over @CAPS20 in the chair @CAPS11 in a burst of hysterical laughter. @CAPS11 Mom heard the thud of me hitting the floor @CAPS3 ran upstairs to find me laughing. "Is @CAPS1's @CAPS9 funny?" she asked. I said to @PERSON1 "@CAPS22 her." @PERSON1 then followed @CAPS3 to grab another chip @CAPS3 and @CAPS34 looked at her from the corner of his eye and slowly brought @CAPS5 to his mouth @CAPS3 took a bite. I started laughing again, but @CAPS11 mom didn't see the sense of humor. She just asked, "@CAPS23 is that @CAPS9 funny?" @PERSON1 replied, "I don't know, but @CAPS34 is dying laughing. I started to stop laughing @CAPS3 I'm on my feet again. Then I told @CAPS11 mom ," @CAPS5 is what @CAPS34 looks like @CAPS18, @CAPS5 just makes @CAPS18 laugh. "Then I @CAPS35 do the same thing, but with no effect on @PERSON1." Isn't @CAPS19 @CAPS5 work? "I asked." @CAPS26 Awesome I said at @CAPS3 @CAPS18're @NUM2. "@CAPS6, @CAPS28 I'll stay at @CAPS5 until I get @CAPS5 right." @CAPS9 I @CAPS35 imitated everything I saw him do, to no avail. All I did was sprinkle @CAPS11 hot chocolate on myself and it made him laugh, albeit not in the way I wanted. "@CAPS18 wants me @CAPS22 @CAPS18?" @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS31!!!! Please!" I begged. "@CAPS6, @CAPS33 Not that I didn't warn @CAPS18." @CAPS34 then went on to grab another chip @CAPS3 looked at me out of the corner of his eye and bit the chip. I started laughing uncontrollably and @CAPS3 didn't stop. After about @NUM1 minutes, I stopped laughing. "I'll do it right!" I said. @PERSON1 said, "@CAPS35 @CAPS5." I grabbed my chips @CAPS3 looked him @CAPS3 bit down, nothing. I @CAPS35 again, this time looking at him from the corner of @CAPS11's eye and nothing. I @CAPS7 said to myself, "@CAPS36 I @CAPS33 didn't get @CAPS5 this time, I'm giving up." "@CAPS6, here it goes." I grabbed a chip @CAPS3 slowly brought @CAPS5 to @ CAPS11's mouth, while squinting @CAPS11 from the corner of his eye. I bit the chip. I noticed the laughter from @CAPS34. @CAPS34 laughed! ! ! "I told @CAPS18 I'd get @CAPS5!" "@CAPS31, @CAPS31 @CAPS18 did it." @CAPS3 This was one of the many laughs I brought @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 together. "
My best friend @PERSON1 and I have been close since @NUM1. We met through @CAPS1 @CAPS2 classes at a local dance studio. We've been in close contact over the years because we've been doing similar activities. Although we are very different from each other. I am more outgoing, I like to speak my mind, I am more carefree. @CAPS4 Just the opposite. @CAPS4 is very conservative, @CAPS4 will take things too seriously. But either way, we managed to balance each other out. Finals week just ended, and @LOCATION1 and I have been planning sleepovers all week. We just need time to relax and give ourselves some time. When I got home from school, I hurriedly called her. "@CAPS3?" @CAPS4 replied. "@CAPS5, @CAPS12 time @CAPS16 Want to hang out?" I asked. "I was thinking about @NUM2?" "@CAPS6 Good!" I hung up quickly and packed my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas and blanket. I put on my shoes, turned around and walked out the door. My dad dropped me off with all my gear. I brought pajamas, pillows and extra blankets. I walked down her sidewalk to her door, knocked, and waited. Seconds later, @CAPS4 answered the question with a big smile on his face. @CAPS4 took me to her basement, @CAPS4 had all the junk food ready for us to attack. @CAPS4 went to the store and bought everything earlier that day. @CAPS4 has set it all up on her old pool table that no one uses. There are chips, cookies, soda, candy, chocolate and pizza. I put my stuff on a chair in the corner of the room and we had a big meal. Of course, we can eat all the food. We are simply not old enough. After nearly an hour of eating straight, we lay on her basement floor trying to keep calm. We started laughing at some of the silly little things in her big-screen @CAPS7 ad. Eventually, we started talking about how each of our finals was going. "I'm doing great in all my areas! I'll get all A's" boasted @PERSON1. @CAPS4 All A's every year since middle school. "I think I'm doing great @CAPS8 too, but not sure about @NUM3," I said, falling to the floor. "@CAPS8, see you tomorrow!" We finally decided to move ourselves to the couch across from the pool table so we could face @CAPS7. Already @NUM4 in @TIME1 and we're still on high sugar. We switch back and forth from watching some old horror movies to the hottest @NUM5 music videos of the week. That's been a while, and before we know it, it's @NUM2 in @TIME1. @PERSON1 and I lie on opposite ends of each other. Sometimes, one of us will grab some chips or candy from the table. We were too tired to open our eyes. No one even has enough energy to turn off the overhead lights. We fell asleep quickly. When I wake up at the next @TIME1, @PERSON1 is no longer across from me. @CAPS4 on the corner chair where I put my stuff. I looked at my watch and it was already @NUM4:30 PM. When I look back, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 seem a little unhappy. I turned under the blanket so I could face her. "@CAPS5..." I muttered as I stretched out. "@TIME1." @CAPS4 said suddenly. @CAPS4 has a folded piece of paper in his hand. "Is @CAPS12 up?" I asked, sitting on the couch. @CAPS4 crumple up that paper and throw it at me. I picked it up from my knees and unfolded. That's her transcript. I scanned the paper and checked all her grades. @CAPS4 got all the A's...and one @CAPS13. @CAPS4 earned @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper and saw her hands covering her face. I walked up to her and was kind of amused by @CAPS4's frustration. "@CAPS16 got @CAPS13...and @CAPS16 cried?" I asked. @CAPS4 quickly looked up at me. I looked at her goofily and @CAPS4 laughed. @CAPS4 feels so stupid to cry over @NUM8 @CAPS13. I also looked at and laughed. I know my grades are much worse than ours. Oops, I'm so glad I got @CAPS13. @PERSON1 and I are best friends. We even outed each other. I told her to relax and @CAPS4 told me to be more focused. @CAPS16 Can't take little things like this too seriously, it's not worth the stress. Sometimes @CAPS16 just needs to relax and stay focused. @CAPS16 has to find the perfect balance of work and play.
In any relationship, whether it's a friend boat, a love boat, or a work relationship boat, laughter is a very good thing. Either way, you need a laugh so you don't get too nervous to have fun. In your life, some people around you need a little laugh every now and then to cheer them up. People should laugh every day because it makes you happy even if you are in a bad mood. When you're trying to kill yourself, all you really want is someone to talk to you and make you smile, laugh, and giggle. It feels really good when you're laughing with a friend or significant other. You love seeing people smiling and laughing. Your friends and family also love seeing you laughing here and there every once in a while. So laugh every now and then, even if it's just for a few seconds of your life, and be happy. Laughter is a big thing in your life. Even if life gets you down and sucks, laughing and giggling is a good thing. Anyone and everyone needs to laugh so they don't become so impatient and unbearable. So please always think about the people around you, and in your life, please smile. Come on, you know you want to laugh. Hahaha. I hope to at least make you smile a little. In any relationship, having or being laughing is an important thing you need in a relationship. Always try to laugh here and there, and no matter how bad life is the moment you laugh, you'll be fine.
I believe that all laughter and sense of humor is what everyone has in common and everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is an infectious but always wonderful commodity. It is the purest joy we have and it brings humanity together. This is the beginning and end of friendship and solidarity. Laughter can ring out and uplift those who really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day better. We all know that feeling of fear and sadness. Kindness, generosity, and a good laugh are one of the few things right today. Even in poverty, depression, and depression, simple laughter can wash away a person's troubles in an instant and fill us with warmth. @PERSON1 and I have been best friends since we were ten and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other laugh when we just want to be angry or just cry. We decided to separate, we were just kind of funny, but combined our strengths we could make anyone laugh. We use each other's strengths when we're having a bad day, or we just need some cheer up. I think we wouldn't even be friends if it wasn't for the laughter. That's really what makes us best friends. We will be different people. Even when I left her we would keep joking, hurt each other's guts, and burst into tears for laughing so hard. My first impression of @PERSON1 was that she stomped over to the park near us and yelled at her sister, who I had been playing with at the time. This would be a very self-explanatory reason why I didn't like her in the first place. Luckily, after visiting @PERSON1's house with my sister @PERSON1, I discovered that we have a lot in common and we are only four months apart. That childish coaxing held our friendship together because it was a little rocky at first. Always arguing and arguing about the present, we look back and laugh at the stupidity of our adolescence. Either of us will make silly little comments about the other when neither of us wants to apologize. At one point, she went on to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of similar things and laugh happily. We were only @NUM1 years old then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and use our mockery to make the most of what we have. Laughter was definitely a Band-Aid at the beginning of our shaky friendship. @PERSON1 has a talent for making anything fun at any time. She said the wrong (but hilarious) thing, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us and it makes our friendship so strong. I wonder what humans would be like if laughter wasn't a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows it's not a good day if you're not laughing, or let alone laughing. People will be bored, just unhappy. Laughter heals people's ailments, and it makes us think maybe everything will be alright. I really believe it's healthy for you. With just one touch, laughter can give us a sense of ecstasy. When it was designed to spread the word of happiness, people took it for granted and dismissed it as false. We are so lucky to have such a naturally happy gift. Can anyone explain in detail what laughter really makes us feel like? I don't think so. It's like describing the smell of something. You just can't do it. Word does not exist. It's so sad to think of those poor poor people who have forgotten what it's like to laugh. I try to laugh every day and at least make another person laugh. What is life without diamonds in rough laughter? This is not life at all, because laughter will always be your safe haven in pursuit of happiness.
Laughter, one of life's greatest gifts. Did you laugh so hard that you cried so much? What if you can't breathe with laughter, or the sound no longer escapes your mouth? I'm the type of person who can @CAPS6 face things so stupid that when I'm done laughing, I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can @CAPS6 so hard that nothing comes up! @CAPS1 It's amazing what laughter does to the heart. The way @CAPS1 makes you feel, the way @CAPS1 makes you act. @CAPS1 is contagious, @CAPS1 happens around us every day. You're never too old to laugh, @CAPS1 happened to be among us. It doesn't matter whether you are young or old, @CAPS1. Laughter has no age limit. Once @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 I stayed up until 3 at @TIME1. We were so delirious and eccentric, we acted like lunatics. Now we have relationship types that @CAPS6 can handle almost anything. Literally just about anything... When we stay up late, we drink a lot of soda and eat sugary foods to fuel us overnight. We wrote songs, we danced around the @CAPS2 house, and @CAPS1 felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears came out of @CAPS2's eyes and @CAPS2's lungs took my breath away. @CAPS1 is funnier when @CAPS1 falls into silent laughter because that guy can't control @CAPS1 and they look hilarious as they rock back and forth with this goofy look on their faces and make no sound at all. Have you ever laughed for the rest of your life? How did you feel after that "lifetime" of laughter? @CAPS1 It almost feels as powerful as the sun warming your heart and soul. When I @CAPS6 I feel all the joy and emotion flowing through @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a bigger feeling than the warmth of laughter. @CAPS1 is great when you and @CAPS3 or a group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even if you're feeling down, you might need some cheer. You can always count on @CAPS6 to help you get the job done. No matter what mood I'm in, @CAPS5 I hear someone laughing, it's hard for @CAPS1 not to join. Laughter is contagious! @CAPS1 affects our daily lives. I bet you can't go a day without hearing someone @CAPS6 or laughing yourself. I probably @CAPS6 about five hundred times a day, @CAPS5 not much. I love hearing people @CAPS6, @CAPS1 light up @CAPS2's mood, and @CAPS2's day. I would definitely say that laughter is very important and beneficial to a relationship. I mean imagine a world without laughter. boring, right? @CAPS2 suggested, @CAPS6 like you heard the funniest thing in the world. @CAPS6 like there is no tomorrow. Who cares @CAPS5 people think it's stupid. You will feel so much better after your tear-induced, breathless, silent but very therapeutic @CAPS6. Laughter really is the shortest distance between people!
Laugher Laughter is an object of joy, fun, or jokes. Laughter is something we all do, it has great benefits in our lives, and it happens in everyday life. Without laughter, we can't express our joy, the outgoing side, we don't have a special feeling in life other than frowning, it's a fact that wrinkling is more because it uses more muscle. Laughter is an all-day thing for me, the @CAPS1 show, my friends, family and horses are the number one reason I frown down. You @MONTH1 don't think horses can smile or talk, but @CAPS2 do have their own way of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @CAPS2 are all smart, but @CAPS2 can be clumsy or stupid at times. For the most part, @CAPS2 will just make you laugh like your own little siblings. One time, I'll be forever locked in my head. It happened on the beach at @ORGANIZATION1 at noon on @DATE1. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses ready to go. We and our horses felt energized as we watched the waves lapping against the shore and the salty smell in our noses. Once we hit the sand, we ran side by side, the wind whistling past our ears like a moving train. The horse's head also pointed to the sea. When we get to the water, the horses are jumping up and down again like yearlings, @CAPS2 will walk into the water and tell us both are soaking wet, then the next wave will come up and we'll turn and try Beat the waves to the shore. After about five hours of caving, dune and starfish exploration, we were all exhausted and decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we had our dinner while watching the sun go down, ending a perfect day at the beach. We put the horse back in the trailer and before I closed the trailer door I patted the horse on the neck and as I was about to go out my horse tilted its head and gave me a nudge like he said "Thank you for the wonderful time". Driving home, I knew it was a perfect day because there was laughter, and all the time I was just laughing for joy, my face was a little sore from laughing so hard.
The story that started with two @NUM1 @DATE1 old boys named @ORGANIZATION1 could already be considered comedy. These are the names of my identical twin cousins, @ORGANIZATION1, who I can honestly admit are @NUM2 of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't the smartest person on earth, @ORGANIZATION1 From the way he names his kids it's clear his sense of humor is a little off, but he's a very hard worker. Occasionally, my mom would do him a favor and take the twins out of his hands for a while, as they might be a minority. Weekends are especially good to end them because I hate my siblings, my brother, my sister, @ORGANIZATION1 and even my mom. Tension levels in the house aren't a healthy amount, so a few @NUM1 @DATE1 seniors running around make it a little bit livelier @ORGANIZATION1 Let's laugh together as a family. When @CAPS7 is at home @ORGANIZATION1 it must be @DATE1 in @DATE2 and we are building our house when the twins come over. My mom was so mad at their crazy high energy levels that she seemed to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My stepdad @PERSON1 needs to go to @PERSON2's nails @ORGANIZATION1 child lock @ORGANIZATION1 I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would be a good idea to bring the twins just to get my mom out of the rowdy mouth for a few minutes. We loaded up the car @ORGANIZATION1 I was driving down the freeway with twins in the back seat having fun playing with ponies @ORGANIZATION1 laughing at people who stop at red lights. We all sang songs like Twinkle Little Stars, @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 until we got to @PERSON2's parking lot. @ORGANIZATION1 finds it fun to run down the island @ORGANIZATION1 hides behind items on lower shelves while @ORGANIZATION1 likes to pretend he's @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 confuses @CAPS7. Eventually the twins got so nasty that @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I caught them @ORGANIZATION1 and strapped them captive to the seat belts of @PERSON2's cart. This was helpful, but not as impartial as we had hoped. We went on an adventure to find child locks, and @ORGANIZATION1 found them on @NUM4 island. There's a big guy standing in front of our destination @ORGANIZATION1 and when I say big I don't mean muscular or tall...I mean he probably has too many @CAPS1 shows he watches every day, @ORGANIZATION1 probably has some I like too many snacks. He has long @ORGANIZATION1 sand blond hair and he wears a dark purple @CAPS2 mold shirt with @ORGANIZATION1 sandals. @ORGANIZATION1 obviously doesn't realize how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude way, especially when they can hear you. He said, "@CAPS3 cow @ORGANIZATION1 look at that lady! She's so big!" @ORGANIZATION1 laughed outrageously @ORGANIZATION1 agreed. "@CAPS4! She's as big as our whole car!" I was a little panicked @ORGANIZATION1 tried to keep them quiet, but the twins noticed @CAPS5's attention and they were more excited to see the guy on the high ladder next to me Giggling @ORGANIZATION1 laughing with them. They were quiet for a moment, then @ORGANIZATION1 gasped, @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed, "@CAPS5 she's as big as a fire truck!" The man turned around and @ORGANIZATION1 glared at me; I apologized at least @NUM5 times as the ladder moved @ORGANIZATION1 started taking the boys off the island. I was walking behind the big man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beep, like the sound of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed and @ORGANIZATION1 frantically shouted: "@CAPS6 run as fast as possible! She's supporting @ORGANIZATION1 and she'll crush you to the floor!" @CAPS7 laughed, even when they made fun of it but I'm embarrassed, I just took them to the car @ORGANIZATION1 wait @PERSON1. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to me. It took only about @NUM6 minutes for @PERSON1 to jog out the door with nails, child lock and a big smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face. I remembered what happened in the @ORGANIZATION1 store and I laughed quietly until @PERSON1 jumped on the truck and I started laughing. When I got home I told my mom what happened and she laughed @ORGANIZATION1 for a while and I laughed harder @ORGANIZATION1, longer than I used to laugh. I went to sleep with a pretty bad headache that night, but I thought it was worth laughing all day.
It's good when I meet new people because everyone needs friends, like people say friends come and go, real friends don't. I remember I met this beautiful girl with the name @PERSON1 to me she was more than a friend I knew I wanted to live with her and be with her Not to love comes from above. I remember when I first spoke to her it was like God was there telling me she was mine and I knew I could save her from love. when i looked her in the eyes for the first time it was like i felt her heart was falling apart so i told her your heart won't break in half cause i would use mine instead of i told her yours that i want that i need someone i have to succeed a mountain to show you that i am different from everyone else and that i am as faithful as everyone else. You look so amazing I won't change everything about you because I love everything about you I love your eyes I love your smile I love your personality so I told her to give me a chance I know you've been thrown a lot But don't let it fall in between, so she said yes, she was happy, like her dream came true, and her man could show her that no one was ever faithful, honest, and true like everyone else, A man who will never lie or cheat. So I told her she was my superman and she was so happy that I was in her life and she said I changed her whole life and she changed mine. My heart does not belong to you and no one else because if you are not the one who has my heart, my heart will be just a toy and stop it. I told her she'd never be so cold I'd keep using my arms and my body temperature to keep her warm day and night I told her all my wishes came true The one you did to me I'm finally no longer alone Now I get so I told her it was like she was finally my wife. I told her every girl I date is playing with my heart and they are unfaithful to me faithful, true, trusting, never lie or cheat, so I tell myself I'll keep looking for that special girl, for now I can say I found her because that girl's name is @PERSON1. I told her that she would never be sad again, nor would a million tears flow down her precious little face. I told her that I would always be one call, not two, but one. When I say she's my heaven my whole world she's so happy she finally made my dreams come true I just wanna be me and you no one else believes in me I believe in you our love will never go away it never will Fall our love will live forever Our love will stand Tell it to rise to the sky Tell the sun not to shine. I'm crazy about her, she's crazy about me, she has the key to my heart, only she can open it, I finally know what love feels like. She turned all my bad days into good ones I'll never break her heart and she won't break mine in the sky. To me you will never leave, you will always be in my heart To me, you are not only a friend, but a friend, you are my angel, my girl, my beauty, my wife, me Everything until the end of the world You are not just my friend, everything I need, I am so glad I found your true story forever
People always say that laughing is an important part of a relationship. is this real? In my opinion, I'm not so sure, but my grandmother said that laughter is always a big part of a relationship. You feel good when you make your best friend, parent, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It's the best feeling ever because you know how to smile at that person. Have you ever walked around the store and found two couples laughing and having a good time? I have, sometimes I feel like I'm in the same place. My grandmother always told me stories of her and my grandpa's youth. She always said "laughter plays a big role in our relationship". When they first met, she was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2. Everyone says they will never last, but the only way they can find out is to wait and believe. Every time she heard his name, she wanted to sing. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. Every time she gets a chance to hang out with him, she feels like all her problems will go away. Every time she thinks of him, she smiles. That's how happy she felt for him. Can we call it love? I said yes, sometimes I wish I was in love like a grandmother. She seems happy every time it talks about him, but I still don't know if laughing is what @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. Every time my grandmother says, "@CAPS1 doesn't have the smartest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knows how to put a smile on my face", I see her smile very brightly. Because she said @CAPS1 is not that smart but @CAPS1 knows how to joke and make her laugh. She once asked me a question "@CAPS2, when you see two couples laughing and having a good time, do you think of them?". The first thing that pops into your mind is that they know how to have fun and don't let anything get in the way of how they laugh and have a good time. My grandmother said the thing that got her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you don't know how to make the other person laugh, you don't know if you can have a good time with that person. When my grandparents were angry with each other, it never lasted long because my grandpa always knew how to make her laugh. If they didn't know how to make each other laugh, maybe they wouldn't be together. I understand now that my grandmother was in love with my grandfather because @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship, you always have to know how to smile at the other person, because if you don't, you're pretty sure things won't work out. My grandmother was right that laughter did play a big role in their relationship. They always know how to make everything better by joking or doing something funny. I will never be mad at my grandparents because they know a lot of tricks to make me laugh. That's what @CAPS2 keeps our family connected, and so do other families. I finally understand that laughter is an important part of a relationship.
"Laughter is the best medicine." Almost everyone has heard this phrase. But it's true @CAPS20! Some days all I can think about is how bad life is for @CAPS23, or at least it seems so. The days when you think everything is wrong and nothing can make it worse...that @CAPS20, one of @CAPS14's best friends will make me laugh. I'm going to laugh so hard I'm on the verge of @CAPS19 @CAPS14 pants and @CAPS14 eye drops. I'll laugh to the point where I can't make a sound, @CAPS14 cramps on both sides and I fall to the ground. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think, even when I'm in a coma, they'll say something so funny that I'll be sitting upright on my hospital bed, @CAPS21 laughing, and sometimes from me laughing out of his belly. @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I feel more silly than usual at this particular time. This tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was different from other times. We staggered to @CAPS1' @CAPS20 house because of how much fun it all was, we were blushing and giddy. You know what it's like when you and your best friend @CAPS9 @CAPS21 @CAPS13 tickle each other? When you start to calm down, you look at your friend and @CAPS21 and you see her nervous look trying not to laugh, you lose it again. If you've ever been lucky enough to experience these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I worked out a whole new set of abs that day, if that gives you an idea of how hard we were laughing. Anyway, we stumbled into her house trying to get serious, because we really had to do at least some homework. Of course we were all hungry after laughing, so @CAPS1 told @ORGANIZATION1 and me we can get some cereal. @CAPS21 Regular milk and cereal, right? @CAPS20 @CAPS22 @CAPS4'n @CAPS5 nothing special (except it' @CAPS20 is delicious). But that day, everything was unusual, especially the milk. This is the best milk I've ever had, I @CAPS6, @CAPS6, @CAPS6, milk so it must mean something. "@CAPS7 This milk is so good! @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8!" @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed. I swear she was choking on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. "@CAPS9 are you kidding me? What kind of milk do you buy?!" I blurted out. For some reason, milk is really special and it blows @CAPS14's mind. "@CAPS10, I don't know @CAPS17. Two percent?" @CAPS1 looked at us in disbelief, raising curious eyebrows at our inquiry. The look on her face made us all burst out laughing. Now, every time one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it happened with @CAPS21. @TIME1, it happened. @CAPS1 peed her pants, not @CAPS21 a little. It's the '@CAPS17 @CAPS21 idle threat rushing out, "@CAPS12' mgoingtopee!" screaming. @CAPS13 No. She actually pissed herself and I still @CAPS16' @CAPS17 I even remember saying something I said made her laugh so hard. All I know is that suddenly (frightened me half to death), she shouted, "@CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8 I @CAPS16' @CAPS17 @CAPS18 @CAPS19! There' @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24!" I turn around and see @CAPS1, blushing and mouth open, leaning against the counter. She looks like that damn @CAPS26 @CAPS27 from @LOCATION1, all bent over like her. Her eyes were tightly closed, the corners of her eyes wrinkled, and a few tears came as she tried to hold back her (apparently) crippled laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I laughed at her completely bluntly. Pointing to laugh @CAPS14 Shaking her shoulders and laughing will only make her laugh harder. Still smiling, she ran down the hall like a penguin to the bathroom where @DATE1 was. @CAPS1 burst through the bathroom door in soggy jeans and red tears on his face, looking a little confused and amused by what happened to @CAPS21. Naturally, @ORGANIZATION1 laughed when she saw her, she was in a ridiculous state of insanity. @CAPS17 anyone? We @CAPS16 always laugh at each other and ourselves, that's why I love @CAPS14 friends. '@CAPS20 is great when you have @CAPS16 people who laugh at everything but don't laugh. @CAPS1 is actually a walking self-promotion as she laughs at every joke and @ORGANIZATION1' @CAPS20 is so smart when she thinks of them. Personally, I love to laugh, especially with @CAPS14's best friend (and mostly).
Once I was skating with my friends and I was going crazy with the relay and I wanted to stop skating. His mom tried to convince me to keep skating. Laughing and saying I'll never skate better, she says I'm better than some people she knows. It made me feel so much better than before, and I started skating every day since. I still laugh when I think about that day. Skating can be fun in many ways. One can skate for fun and compactness. There are different ways of skating, and people have different ways of skating. There are many different kinds of skateboards and they ride them differently. Some skaters I would laugh at the way they skate.
"Laughter" Good relationships are built on trust, right? That's what I've heard all my life, but as I grew up and really started to think for myself, I came up with my own guide to survival, a good relationship for anyone, if you will. Of course trust is important, but @CAPS2 is not the only key factor, I learned that laughter is just as important not only to start a relationship but to energize @CAPS2. One person in my life helped me really understand this and be able to build this relationship with them. My mom and I have such a deep bond and way of understanding each other that other girls I know don't always have that relationship with their mom, and I'm lucky. Of course we have tough times like any family, but over time we have been able to laugh at @CAPS2 and start a new life. @CAPS5 helped me realize, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS1 A good relationship with my mom is very important to me, but we don't always go so well. From about ten to thirteen, I kind of didn't want to express my emotions, I just wanted to be calm. Then seeing that my mom is a strong and beautiful person, I have to admit I was a little worried that @CAPS5 would think I was disappointed. I guess I'm afraid to show her who I really am. Whenever @CAPS5 jokes with me, I take @CAPS2 seriously, and whenever we fight over little things, I think @CAPS5 will hate me forever. I know now that I was stupid to think that, but I'm really glad we went through this. I think that's part of what makes us stronger, like there's no rainbow without rain, or no happy ending if all is well in your life. Little did I know that the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner, my mom told me @CAPS2 was my dishwashing night, not like usual I completely forgot, then went to my room to listen to music and ended up falling asleep. My mom came to my room with depression and depression. @CAPS5 said, "@PERSON1, why are you ignoring me? Washing the dishes now." I jumped out of bed without a word and walked towards the kitchen. @CAPS5 followed me into the bright little room, "@PERSON1? Are you okay, @CAPS2 is okay you forgot. I'm not mad." @CAPS5 exclaimed. Again, not a word escaped my mouth. I was afraid to say anything, and when I turned to find her not there, my only sound was a sigh of relief. When I finished my plate, @CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried looking at her face, @CAPS5 looked worried. @CAPS5 explained to me her relationship with her mom, @CAPS5 would love to be with me. @CAPS5 tell me how they'll be together @CAPS3 on stupid things, and how they'll promise each other that when they fight, they'll stop, take a deep breath, and @CAPS3. "@CAPS3? What? Why did you guys do that?" I questioned. @CAPS5 replied, "@CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad mood or bad day, as grandma used to say." @CAPS5 helped me experience this by teasing and joking. For the first time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and fell asleep, I knew things were going to be different from now on, and it was. We have now made this commitment to each other and we are now able to have wonderful smiling memories together. Now I'm fifteen and honestly my mom will always be my best and most sincere friend. Our bond, the way we get through tough times, and the way we can @CAPS3 get rid of all the stress in life makes me feel like I can get through anything. I really understood what the saying "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" means.
laughter. What story would you like to hear about laughter? Well, my life is full of laughter and smiles. Crazy I know! If it weren't for the laugh, I wouldn't have the six-pack I have today. Have you ever wondered when one person can make another laugh, and they usually become very close friends, even best friends? My boyfriend is my best friend. This time my boyfriend and I laughed so hard. My boyfriend is my life. I was with him almost every day and he was amazing. I'm fine with him and we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best friend anyone could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, and a lot can happen in a year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even break free from the ones you just formed. Me and @PERSON1 we are always laughing at each other and at other things. We always have a good time together. @DATE1 @TIME1 it's late, he's taking me home as usual. There was a field with very tall grass, and we were walking beside it. Suddenly, he acted like he was being pulled into the grass. So guess what I did, I screamed as loudly as I could! Then he started calling me by name in a creepy voice and told me to come to the grass. Out of curiosity about what just happened, I started walking towards the tall grass. When I got to where he got into the grass, he told me "@CAPS1 I lost my shoes and I can't seem to find them anywhere!" @PERSON1 and I started looking around for his shoes. It was dark and we couldn't see anything, so we looked around for his shoes with our hands, "Found it!" I said. After finding the shoes, we realized that two hours had passed. We were so tired, laying on the grass to rest and rest and we all started laughing at how ridiculous it was for us to spend two hours on what was considered a little joke! marvelous. When we finally got up, our tummy hurts badly and it hurts. I've never laughed like this in my life. Every time I'm with @PERSON1 is the best time. We always seem to find ways to make each other laugh. You might find it hard to laugh without a best friend, or even a friend. With friends, you always have someone who can laugh and who can laugh with you. That's why I cherish my best friend @PERSON1 and all the joy and laughter times we've had together because you never know when the last time you saw that person. I try to make myself happy and always make people laugh because laughter is the best form of exercise.
Laughter is a big part of my relationship. I feel more connected to one person if we laugh together. Laughing makes you feel great. You may be in a stage of depression, and a friend or family member may come up to you to reassure you and make you laugh. If I had a relationship without laughter, I would leave that person as soon as possible. Some people think of relationships as just money and/or appearance. People now and days don't last that long in a relationship. In ancient times, people died together, and there were graves when they died. My boyfriend's name is @PERSON1. We've been out for four years. He is very humorous and I love his jokes. Sometimes he wasn't even going to make a joke, but he did. When we first went out, I was throwing a birthday party and me, @PERSON1 and a friend of his walked into the woods to hide from everyone else. When others came to us, we jumped out to scare them. Where did they get mad at us, but when night fell we all laughed together. My mom and dad really rarely laugh together. They just go to @ORGANIZATION1 together and go home together. My dad likes to make jokes from time to time, but my mom is the kind of person who likes to laugh at people being hurt. My grandma is so funny. She tries to make people laugh and hurt themselves so she can have fun with it. All my friends are funny. My best friend @LOCATION1 is the funniest girl I know. She likes to dance funny dances and laugh at people she doesn't like. When she was working, she would try to find something to make a joke so she could bring it to me and almost make me pee my pants. @LOCATION1 has a very bad relationship. She likes to laugh, but her boyfriend hates jokes. She tried to persevere, but things got worse and worse. The only thing he would do is sit on the bed or the couch and play video games or watch wrestling. He will let @LOCATION1 clean his room and wash the dishes. He has a one-year-old sister, and when he plays video games in the room, he makes her watch her, clean her, and feed her. @LOCATION1 got tired so she packed up and left. She went to her sister's house. Now she has a funny boyfriend and they always laugh together. There can be a laughable relationship with animals and humans. An animal is something that cannot talk back or make fun of you. Animals are like humans, but they can't speak and have fur. My cat is the king of my house. His name is @CAPS1. He likes to follow me around my house. I love to sit on the floor and watch him wrestle with all the other cats. Every time I walked into the kitchen, he was always with me, packing food. After eating, he gets an erg energy and runs around the house. It makes me laugh. He would stop in front of me, stare at me, and if I moved, he would run away. Cats are cute, but not all cats have the ability to see into your soul like mine. @CAPS1 has big eyes, meows sweetly and keeps on calling. The funniest thing about him is how fat he is. He is a fat cat, but he is only one year old. So when I saw him running around, I laughed. So does my horse. His name is @CAPS2 and he is four years old. He's a crazy horse, but at the same time he's funny. He was trying to play with my other horses and he was injured because he bit them so they kicked him back. He has blue eyes so I bought him for my purposes. Some people think horses are just a bill, but I think they are my family.
Everyone loves to laugh. There was laughter everywhere. Laughter comes from joy, and joy comes from joy in life. I have had many joys in my life. Since I am having fun, I tend to laugh a lot throughout the day. One topic that made me laugh was my niece. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the cutest little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Because she's so young, she doesn't have any concerns or worries about the world. She knew everything would be taken care of. In this situation, she was full of joy and happiness, which caused her to laugh. When I'm with her, everything that happens is laughter and play. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar that sings a silly little song when you put shapes into the correct slots. The song made her laugh and dance uncontrollably. This in turn makes me laugh. It quickly turned into a huge laugh. These are the greatest moments. Recently, we added another family member. @PERSON1, my nephew and brother @CAPS2. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughed even harder. She thought it was the funniest thing when he started laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see, the laughter is happy and funny. Laughter begins with a smile, and a smile comes from happiness. Lots of things make me laugh out loud. My nieces and nephews are just one example. What makes you laugh?
Why does laughter bring people so close? Is it because the laughter is about trusting each other, or just because you know each other. There are many kinds of laughs, like a joke, or someone doing something very embarrassing. The story I'm about to tell is how such a bad day of hunting turned into the funniest moment ever. It all started @TIME1 when I woke up and I forgot to put wet clothes from the washer into the dryer. Now I have to rummage through all the clothes in my room to find camouflage that isn't dirty, or something I can wear. By this time, anyone would be in a bad mood and try to rush out the door. When my buddy @PERSON1 showed up and was ready to go, I didn't. I'm rushing, you're bound to forget something while you're rushing, and I left my gun in the house. After five miles, I noticed that I had forgotten my gun, so we turned around and went back to get it. Now we're not only late, we're scrambling to the cottage for breakfast, and @PERSON1 has eggs so we can make omelets. As we were going down we hit a bump in the road, I mean everything hit the ceiling of the truck and then hit the floor. In the process of doing this, all the eggs in the egg carton broke, so now we have no eggs, and no eggs means no breakfast. We're running late with about thirty minutes to the shoot so @PERSON1 and I can meet up with our other friends @PERSON3 and @PERSON2. Finally, we reached the blind spot before sunrise, and when we were ready, a group of 20 mallards unexpectedly dropped and took off before we had time to shoot. Now that everyone thinks they're fine, we have a chance to save ourselves from the dreaded @TIME1. Only to find out that those ducks were the only ducks we saw all day. Around twelve, we gave up and went back to the cabin, but on the way up the hill we were trapped in two inches of water by the truck. I remember thinking, "@CAPS1 this isn't really happening to us". So @PERSON3, @PERSON2 and I got out of the car to push and @PERSON1 stayed in the car and drove. They made several attempts to push the truck out, and finally on the sixth attempt we pushed the truck hard out of the mud. Now the fun part is that when we broke the truck free, @PERSON1 was on the throttle, causing the truck tires to spin and mud everywhere. When I saw mud everywhere, I jumped behind @PERSON2 and used him as a fender. At this point @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 are an inch thick layer of mud from @CAPS2 head to toe. You can't help but laugh, it's the funniest thing ever. @PERSON1 has watched it all through his rearview mirror and once he was no longer stuck in the truck he fell off the truck because he laughed so hard. Even @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 laughed. So you never know what's planned for the day when nothing happens or bad luck, and in that case, it's one of the most memorable things I can remember happening during duck season.
"@CAPS1 trying to figure something out! I'm so bored!" @CAPS2 explained, and we all relaxed next, his dark blue @CAPS3 parked gracefully outside my door. @ORGANIZATION1 is young and as little boys we need to do something. The gears started turning in my head! When I thought of a very interesting bulletproof program. "@CAPS4 I get it!" I yelled. "@CAPS1 here, I'm really disappointed @CAPS21," @CAPS6 responded quickly. “@CAPS7 because @CAPS2 has a car so he can drive into town and buy some cheap saran rap and then @CAPS15 go back to the four-way intersection near me and tie the rap to two trees across the street so the car will pass It!" I explained quickly, breathlessly. When I realized that the idea was golden, my friends were all standing and laughing from all directions. "I'll drive to get it, but does anyone have the money to spend too much!" @CAPS2 popped up and @LOCATION2, @CAPS6 and I handed him the single bill. "Enough! Give me a few minutes and then we can meet at the intersection near @CAPS10," @CAPS2 said as he swept everyone off his car and started walking out of my neighborhood. "@CAPS12 Text me when you're coming back!" I screamed at @CAPS2 as his poorly maintained engine roared in the @TIME1 sky. Minutes passed and the rest of us were just sitting on the curb, chatting, and waiting for @CAPS2. The bell rings my custom ringtone for incoming text. My eyes quickly scanned the contents of my phone and concluded that @CAPS2 is ready to use saran rap at a four-way intersection. "@CAPS15 on @CAPS1 @CAPS4 go! @CAPS2 is ready, so @CAPS1 do this" I muttered as I grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit near my house. @CAPS6 follows, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 follow. I shouted again to step up the pass. @CAPS2's headlights lit up the air at @ORGANIZATION1 as he flashed a signal to show us where he was. All four of us trotted down the driveway of a house for sale near the exit near me, where @CAPS2 parked. "@CAPS17 you @CAPS4 long enough," @CAPS2 explained. "Okay, we're all here! So @CAPS1 go to the intersection and set it up!" @PERSON1 explained that the starting point was too far away, about 50 yards from the intersection. When we got to the intersection, there were no cars! We all @CAPS17 took this opportunity, @NUM1 and @PERSON1 watch out for the cars! "I started the process while shouting @CAPS2. I quickly turned on the saran rap and ran across the street, undoing the rap as I walked. Soon when @CAPS2 and I were both on the opposite side of the street, we both started on Banging the saran around the tree we had picked out. Once I pulled and checked it and found it was perfect, I rushed to a short fence, which is a block on the side of a boarder intersection. I guess this is where all my friends are A place to hide." Haha, this is perfect! I make sure everything feels good! "I explained that we were all watching the delicate rap, not running from either side of the two-way street. "@CAPS21 We have to wait," @PERSON2 said, as anticipation fell into place. Four heads shaking Up and down as we check if the car is on the road. Since it's about @NUM2 pm, most of the good folks at @LOCATION1 are sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car comes out of @CAPS21, speeding, and only @NUM3 Yards of mischief. "@CAPS22," I shouted, and the car continued to get closer and closer. Boom! The car accelerated through saran rap, then slammed to the brakes. The laughter erupted into chaos as the inspected target was fully inspected .But the angry male driver heard our laughter and decided to get out of his car and chase us! "@CAPS23 get up," I screamed! We all @CAPS23 when the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late Late to @CAPS6! Angry people caught him because the rest of us were chasing it for my house. As soon as we got to my house, we all started asking ourselves what happened @CAPS6! Suddenly ran out of @CAPS21, @CAPS6 ran over and we started laughing again when he @CAPS22 got to us! @CAPS6 was dripping soda all over the left side! @CAPS6 will never tell us what happened to @ORGANIZATION1, although we can guess Arrived! With @CAPS25 and the long @ORGANIZATION1 ringing, we all called out and sacked my house. But there was no shortage of laughs from @ORGANIZATION1 as we all fell asleep!
Fun flight. This is @DATE1 for this @DATE2, after a long @DATE1 and some crying @CAPS3 many goodbyes, I'm finally at the airport, waiting for my flight to @LOCATION1. I've been to that airport many times... I love @LOCATION2 but always happy to go on vacation @CAPS3 I @CAPS1 and my parents are very frequent. Today is different, this is not a holiday. It will be a whole year. @CAPS3 My parents won't be there. Just thinking about staying away from them @CAPS3 all my friends at @LOCATION2 for so long has made my stomach ache. Especially since at @NUM1, I'm going to meet my boarding parents @CAPS3 I've never met before, wondering if they're normal people or a pair of total weirdos. Once on a plane, I was sitting with a young girl studying architecture @CAPS3 at @LOCATION2 to go home for the winter.. when I just left it. @CAPS2 asked "@CAPS1 do you speak English" @CAPS3 I said "I try" @CAPS2 laughed, @CAPS2 looks good with a big smile, @CAPS2 is beautiful too. We started talking @CAPS3 @CAPS2 how nervous I feel @CAPS3 anxious. @CAPS2 asked if I was okay @CAPS3 I told her I was going to be a stage student for next year @CAPS3 I had concerns about it like meeting people or missing home. @CAPS2 told me "you'll be fine, don't worry.. I wish I had this chance at your age" @CAPS3 then changed the subject. After a long conversation @CAPS2 started reading the magazine @CAPS3 I put my music on. Screaming d so hard when we were about to get @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 made me jump and we laughed for a long time @CAPS3 @CAPS2 can't even talk to me @CAPS3 explain why @CAPS2 screams because everyone Watching us @CAPS3 it made it even more fun @CAPS3 was so embarrassed that @CAPS2 couldn't stop laughing. Then @CAPS2 told me that the guy in her magazine photo went to high school with her a few years ago @CAPS3 They were together for a while, but after graduation they didn't know anything about each other. He's now working at a bank @CAPS3 making a lot of money, really making money... @CAPS2 is talking frantically to himself @CAPS3 asking why @CAPS2 stopped talking to him. Great time with her, even though I never saw her again made me really happy @CAPS3, I was more confident when we got off the plane @CAPS3 almost forgot all my previous nervousness. After @NUM2 months everything is perfect @CAPS3 I'm sure even just a few laughs @CAPS3 won't be a hat plane for long and when I go back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS3 will be thinking of @CAPS4 and I will be thinking of She, @CAPS3 I would count that moment as my first good @CAPS5 experience.
In the many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and comfort. There was no laughter despite one person I had a relationship with, it was boring and sad. I would spend a lot of time getting him to giggle or laugh a little. He's a mild-mannered guy who would never hurt a fly, but even when he's happy, he can't laugh. I would ask over and over again "Are you sure you're happy because you don't look like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is frowning" I tell him with a sour face and he replies "Yeah @CAPS1 I'm happy, but I don't laugh doesn't mean I'm unhappy, how can I be unhappy except with a smirk on your face?" With that reply, I just shrugged and started over. "Then why can't you laugh?" he replied in a sleepy voice, because he was tired of the same topic every day. "It's not that I can't laugh, it's that I choose not to laugh" and I say "Well, why the hell are you doing that?" He sighed, really tired of the subject. "Well, if you don't stop this," he said in a soft but nervous voice, "I'm going to have to stop being so nice to you, and I'll probably not talk to you for the rest of the year" but of course He's just kidding, he'll never be nice to me, and he's my best friend, he can't help but talk to me. This topic was dropped and never brought up again until @DATE1 I saw him. @DATE2 was cold when I walked out of the house for school one morning. I saw a moving truck outside his house and knew right away that he wasn't lying to me, but instead told me he was moving. I'm starting to think it's because I always ask him why he's not smiling, but that's a stupid reason to leave. I went to his house and didn't care if I was late or never at school @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. As soon as I got to his porch, he went to the door and I blocked the door so he couldn't go any further, making sure he had to answer me if he wanted to get that box of clothes to the truck. I asked him and he said, "My dad got a promotion at work and now we have to move to New York". I started crying when he told me about it, I was about eight and he was twelve. I knew I wasn't going to see him again, so I made sure that before I left school, we would hang out before he left. In the park that night, he willingly told me without me asking him. "@CAPS1, I know you've been wondering why I don't laugh" he said and continued, "Like I said not that I can't laugh, it's that I don't want to...I just... When I was young I was made fun of for my smile." I don't understand, why would anyone make fun of him? So I asked "why? Why would anyone make fun of you, your nice guy" and he replied "because it didn't look good until my new teeth came over my old ones". Again I was still confused, his teeth were fine to me, so again I asked "then why don't you smile, now your teeth look fine to me" and he said "I would, but I don't know where After being teased so much for years I just didn't think it was necessary, okay now...I can smile and honestly I thought" I said "really!?" Too excited. "Yeah, the only reason is you, you're the only one that makes me want to laugh, because of your smile, you're always so happy. I just can't admit it to myself well, because you're a girl, come to me Saying I want a girl makes me want to laugh, and being the only friend I have younger than me makes me feel a little weak." I didn't understand that at the time, but now that I'm older, I understand, I Glad I had a night to see his smile and a lot of phone calls to hear him laugh. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and frankly, it's absolutely true, because after that night, our friendship went a step further, just a phone call @DATE2 and a little laugh.
You don't really need a reason to laugh these days. Laughter just emanated from some, as often as breathing air. I believe everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they like to be around. One of my favorite people to hang out with is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter the situation, as long as we're around each other, we end up having fun. Laughter can completely change a bad day. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened a few weeks ago. A "friend" of mine tried to make a cruel joke on me and ended up making a bigger mistake than she thought. Once I found out that someone I once trusted was trying to annoy me, my emotions were overwhelmed. At one point, I actually considered attacking this girl in the middle of everyone at school. Thankfully, I used better judgment to run away from her and hide instead of hurting her. Halfway through the course time, I was still frustrated and not ready to face her. So I was hiding there until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 came to comfort me after learning what happened. She kept talking to me until I calmed down and the tears stopped. She makes me feel better. She was just by my side and being able to reminisce about the happy times we had together and the laughter we shared seemed to make all my problems go away. Eventually, she convinced me to go and talk to my "friend" who ended up feeling ashamed of his actions. We were able to make amends and return to some kind of normal life. To this day, and probably for the rest of my life, I believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky because I've found the best person in my life to share all my laughter. Everyone must have one.
Friends aren't always who we want them to be, they're not always easy to find, but friendship can be just with smiles and laughter. I mean, what friendship is without those moments when you pee with laughter. When you're laughing until you can't breathe, you'll feel like you've just done a hundred crunches. Of course you @MONTH1 met a friend like this, @MONTH1 when you least expected it. I didn't expect new friendships, but in a new town and new people, I met friends I now call best friends. It's @NUM1 year and I'm new to @ORGANIZATION1. In the classroom, everyone was staring at me like I was some kind of criminal, and when I passed their desk, everyone was talking about me behind my back, or so I thought. My class teacher @PERSON2 @CAPS1 My so called schedule. Issue 6, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1's class. What? @CAPS2, what is that. I didn't really know what @CAPS2 was until I walked into that class. I turned the rusted doorknob to the gym where I was supposed to be in class. I walked in and there I found out what @CAPS2 is. It was a single wheel bike. Wow! I laughed and thought how I didn't know. I looked around and saw that I was the only sixth grader around. I sat down and looked around trying to figure out if I was really the only sixth grader there when a girl who looked my age walked in. She sat down and I wondered if she was fine so I could go and talk to her, but I was embarrassed. @PERSON1 asked everyone to split into pairs and I asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started using unicycles and our partners had to help us get on and ride until we could ride without assistance. After class, I told her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me hers was @CAPS3. I'm super excited to go to class next time because I actually have a "friend" now, at least someone I talk to. I went to class and she was absent, so I was a lonely person during that time. I have to partner with another girl named Savannah Witch, she's a total teenage girl. She doesn't want to ride @CAPS2, she just wants to talk. I'm tired of her at the end of the day and I haven't practiced my unicycle. I really hope @CAPS3 will show up in class the next day and she does. This time we had to do a routine with our partner for a song we wanted, so we were excited. When suddenly we both fell, we started practicing and trying to come up with something. We stared at each other and started laughing, I couldn't breathe, she was almost peeing. It was one of the best times I had that year and I felt like she and I could be best friends. We are very close friends now, it's just the laughter at that moment that made our hearts stick. We love to laugh, and we believe that the more you laugh, the younger you look, and I think that's true. Everyone has their own story of how they met someone and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship there is a smile or laughter. A moment of laughter, you laugh so hard, you fart and milk comes out of your friend's nose. It's a wonderful time, you never forget it, it's so simple yet so special, it really marks your heart and how you feel about that person. It turned my friendship with the person I met Barley into what is now inseparable and amazing.
It was a normally bright and warm @DATE1 day into my 5th grade. My sister and I spend all day playing with other neighbors of the same age. One of the neighbors happened to be a boy. We can't find anything to do. It's too hot outside to walk around in the sun, so we decided it would be cool to play in the shade with a new slingshot made by @CAPS1. He made it out of an old swing seat and I think my neighbors would love it. We all went into the garage to get it. My sister offered to help me take it off because she was tall and hung high, but I declined. It's my idea to show him, so I'll be the one to get it. As I focused, stretched and reached for it, I noticed that everyone around me was giggling. When I started to wonder what they were all laughing at, my focus grew weaker and weaker. I stood there confused for a minute before I found out what was going on. My sister pulled down my pants in front of our boy neighbors. I picked up my pants from the floor, looked at my sister, and started hitting her with my loose fists. I ran straight back to my room and cried all the way there. After a while, my sister came in and tried to bribe me from under the covers with the last two fruit characters. She sat on my bed and waited for half an hour and I didn't budge. She didn't say anything, but I could feel her eyes pierce me through the sheets. Later that night, I finally came out. My sister keeps apologizing, but it doesn't matter to me because I'm mad at her, that's all that matters. The whole day went by the next day and nothing changed. She's still apologizing and I'm still ignoring it. My @CAPS1 came up to me and told me she was also very sorry and upset because I didn't speak to her. I thought to myself, "how could she be upset..." but I realized I wasn't treating her right, even though I wasn't happy with her. After hearing what my @CAPS1 said, I don't think it's worth it. For the first time in days, I went to talk to my sister. She told me she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking for a while, I came to the conclusion that I was angry because she did this in front of our friends. We joke like this all the time, but never in front of anyone outside our family. I was terrified that this would scare our neighbor friend away, but he came back to play in a few days, so I have nothing to be offended about. As embarrassing as I am, I admit it was funny. We had a good laugh and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling on the past will get you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh it off. Since then, every time it was mentioned, we laughed so hard that tears came down. I wouldn't think it was a good thing when it happened, but I do now. This is another memory that my sister and I share and can recall. The more ridiculous memories you share, the closer it will bring you to someone.
Making someone laugh is the best feeling for their soul and it is one step closer to inner happiness. People might say that when they feel good in the body, that is when they know they are doing something right. I agree with this because it happened to me; I was frustrated with something I didn't even remember, but when I felt the need to help someone do something I knew deep down, I did it in that moment Something very special. It's amazing how you make people laugh and you feel happy no matter where you are. The person with the greatest sense of humor in my life is my mother. She always needs something fun. People love to laugh so much that if they drink some kind of energy drink they don't want to stop laughing. I've heard people say that laughter is healthy for the soul, and it also makes the soul and body last longer. Laughter is a way of expressing yourself without words. This can be a great way to start a conversation with a person. Positive thinking leads to making the right choices, especially if happiness guides you to move on with your life. By making others laugh, the embarrassment disappears. It is better to laugh than to be sad. Everyone is addicted to what they need to depend on. My mom's addiction is laughing. Whenever I'm around, she laughs at work, especially the house. Although, sometimes whenever something goes wrong, she gets frustrated. I hate seeing her like this because it frustrates me. When she is sad, if nothing in the world can make her happy. If a person is depressed, that feeling is passed on to those closest to them. Eventually, I got tired of seeing a mom like this, and in this case I couldn't help but get up and start doing ridiculous things to cheer her up. Some of the things that popped into my head was that I could start dancing fun or telling little lies that might have happened at school and I thought it would cheer her up. When I get a chance to make someone laugh, I like to put a smile on their face. My mom meant the world to me as I meant the world to her. We help each other in any way we can. This day she came home from get off work and my dad was sitting at the table reading the newspaper and my mom came in and noticed that my dad hadn't cooked yet and she started getting mad at him. She thought he was stupid for not cooking dinner for us. She was mad at him for a while, so she started cooking us dinner, but she did it wrong. She was mixing the spices in the wrong pot and I was going to let her know she was doing it wrong, but my dad stopped me lest I get more angry. She finally finished cooking and served us our plate, but we didn't want to eat it because she made the food angrily and made it smell funky. My dad forced us to eat it because he thought eating these foods would make her happy but he was wrong and it only made her feel worse because my youngest brother didn't like it. I felt bad so I had to do something fun to get her in the mood not to get mad at my dad. I turned on @CAPS1 and changed @CAPS2 to music @CAPS2 and started dancing like I had ants in my pants. Her lungs were about to burst because she laughed so hard, she ended up in a good mood for the rest of the time. Wherever I go, I can see people smiling and laughing about something and it just makes me curious about the funny things that are being said. I think making a person feel good about themselves is a good thing because it brings a positive feeling to the room. I love seeing people happy because it always makes me happy. A better way to be happy when you smile is to get one step closer to smiling. My mom and I love walking so we don't feel separated and close to each other, and every time we walk we see different people and we always get a smile from them. That's the best feeling in the world, to feel happy is to be free from all your problems.
"Laughter is the key to the soul." @CAPS1, you're having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, and laughter always makes it better. One day I was sitting in @CAPS2 class and was mortally bored. Then, a shy, quiet child, suddenly laughed! @CAPS3 can't stop! Like @CAPS3 on "laughing gas". @CAPS3 laughed so hard @CAPS3 couldn't breathe. Now that makes me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laughs. Soon the whole class was laughing! So even though some of the @CAPS2 class might be bored, or have a bad day, the laughter spread throughout the room and made today a better day. The laughter spread like wildfire, making everyone happier. When you are happier, you are healthier. So there has to be laughter in the @CAPS2 relationship for it to work. When you ask someone if they like their boyfriend or girlfriend there, if it's a @CAPS2 relationship, they'll almost always say, "@CAPS3/She makes me laugh." @CAPS5 When you're not laughing in a relationship , you end up with more arguments, more disagreements, and more disappointments. The more you laugh, the better you can live and enjoy life more. Did you laugh today?
They are many joys in life, some more relevant than others, some so obvious that you would be foolish not to pay attention to them. Have you ever just sat on the porch or stared out the window just to watch the sunrise, as you sit there thinking about your life and its unusual qualities, all the good memories, all the laughter you've shared, all the all the grief, all the pain, all the love and hate. It's not surprising that almost everyone does this, they want to know if they can change things, how are they going to do it, or they're going to do it the way they started, enriching their life is complete, they are complete, no any regrets. For all the tears I've shed and all the pain I've been through, there's always a laughter to cover up the sadness. There was a time when I sat down and catered to my life and although I didn't live long and my real experience was yet to come, I went through a lot in my short experience, but it didn't bother me because I've accepted that in It happened in my time period and I learned a lot from it. I've learned that no matter how hard you try, you can't be completely honest about your life, their life is always going to be unexpected or unexpected, all you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. It's not hard to be happy, just keep an open mind and a light heart and soon you'll find yourself laughing with the rest of the world and enjoying your brief time on this amazing planet we call @LOCATION1 so listen to you Your mother and father, or even the most respected people in your life. There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals, but the most important thing I can think of is not just one thing, it's a collection of things like love, laughter, New beginnings and old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is walk on it), the ruthlessness of the universe, and the idea that @MONTH1 there are other planets out there that could support life, maybe even intelligent life. It's easy to find something to live for, and even easier to find something to die for, hopefully you'll find something to live for. I remember it was tough, I thought I would never be happy, I didn't feel like I fit in with the world and its many confusing aspects. I've reached the end of the road, or so I thought, but something happened when I was sitting on the edge of an old road. I looked up at the stars and thought, what would I miss if I ended my path now, what name would I dare to name my child if I ever had the chance. If I marry who? Get married, will our love last like morning or fade. So I finally decided that if I ended it so soon, I wouldn't go through too much. After that fateful night, my life slowly shaped into a better person, wanted a bright future, told my children a romantic new but burning love story, and hoped with devotion, trust and respect can last. But that's not all I want to risk. I want to find inner peace in a place where silence is scarce, and I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals, rather than pushing them aside or abusing their natural right to be with us on this @LOCATION1, I think Solve the pollution problem that we humans generate more than help. I think I'll do it in my small way, because in our very large home, there's just one person and one little thing, but as long as I'm small, what I do or say makes a difference. So if I want to look back and laugh, I have done what I consider myself to be, making this planet a shared and healthy one.
A true story of how two close friends became friends through laughter. One year they were a boy named @PERSON1 who wanted to insert something fun on @DATE1 and just stayed in his room all day playing video games. So he heard about a show called "@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1" from a friend and found out if he could join and help the show, but in the end he got involved and offered as much backstage as possible help. @PERSON1 found out that he really liked the drama and made a lot of friends. When @PERSON1 was having fun, they were a girl named @ORGANIZATION1, she didn't talk to @PERSON1 at all, but she liked him, and she didn't tell a lot of people. @ORGANIZATION1 also make as many friends as possible while on the show and spend as much time with them as possible. Towards the end of the show @PERSON1 stares at @PERSON2 who is @ORGANIZATION1's brother, stares at her a little more, finds out from her brother that she likes @PERSON1 but @PERSON1 already knows her from the way she behaves around @PERSON1 It looks like he really likes him. @PERSON1 joined another game called "@CAPS2 in @LOCATION1" after finishing "@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1" because he had so much fun in the first game. @PERSON1 finds out that he already knows most people doing their first game. So he stared at other people @PERSON1 didn't know yet. This is when @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 stare at each other and talk to each other, they both find they enjoy each other's laughter and they become different close friends. They become such close friends and change quickly because @PERSON1 likes to make friends easy to change and @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't have many friends or close friends, or maybe @ORGANIZATION1 likes him a lot. @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't have many friends because the kids at school would make fun of her for being so smart and then she went home for her education and lost some of her only friends. @PERSON1 soon found out in their friendship that @ORGANIZATION1 was afraid that @PERSON1 didn't want to be her friend because she had lost all her friends. Towards the end of the play @PERSON1 had noticed that @ORGANIZATION1 liked @PERSON1 before they were friends, he asked her if she liked him, she said no at first, but then she felt so bad confided in him and told him how she was Love the truth about him and how she thinks it would be best if they were just friends. Both knew that because of their age difference, they could only be friends. @PERSON1 is @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 is @NUM2. So they both know that, because of their age, this will never work out. So they both agreed that it would be best if they just remained friends. As the drama wraps up, they use every minute of it to develop their friendship. At the end of the play, the two of them became good friends, enjoying their good time together and laughing with each other. Even after the show, they still had time to talk to each other, but they didn't see each other very often. When they had time to talk, they talked about the good times they had with each other and the fun they had. They also talked about how great and fun they were in the drama. They both agree to perform again next time @DATE1 and look forward to seeing you @DATE1 next time and how many great things they will have to talk about. Closing Closing I think @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 will be friends for a long time. Maybe when they grow up, they can become more friends and take their friendship to the next level...only time will tell.
I never thought that laughter could help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 can. Just by laughing with someone can make you meet a new person. I first @CAPS6 one of the things someone tries to be funny is laughing. Once you know the other person is talking about @CAPS2, you forget that you're just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS4 happened at @LOCATION1 and my family and I usually go there every year on @DATE1. I made a good friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a hot place and usually gets sun every day. During the days I was there, I went out for a walk with my sister and cousins, or went to the beach with my family. I remember @CAPS4 the day my cousins and I went to a small shop across the street from where we lived. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring us @CAPS6 and we went back to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins and his friend there. @CAPS6 I saw them and the only thing they were doing was laughing at something. I couldn't hear them, but as we got closer, I heard interesting things they said. I couldn't help eavesdropping, so I started laughing. A friend of his saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him, and of course I said no. I told him I overheard his conversation, so he started laughing. "It's funny not @CAPS4" he told me with a laugh. "@CAPS1 @CAPS4 Yes. I didn't know you were making such a joke" I replied. He continued talking to me, and he said, "I always talk like that, so don't be afraid. I said @CAPS4 not to hurt anyone." I think @CAPS4 is fine for him, but I already know that in @LOCATION1 people would speak like that. We continued chatting @CAPS6 and I started laughing again. "@CAPS2 did I say it now?" he asked. "@CAPS3. I just remember what you said at the beginning @CAPS2. That was really funny" I replied. For some reason I can't forget what he said @CAPS2 and I don't think I ever will. I think @CAPS4 may be very surprised by the way we met. I've never seen a man, especially a man, laugh first. I guess I think @CAPS4 is a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with people lets them know that we are interested in their subject and that we understand them. That's at least what I think @CAPS2. I had a great talk with my new friend. We discussed how I took time off. I told him I go every year and I always love them. My family and I had a great time with grandparents and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I'd rather live in @LOCATION1 than somewhere I know because @CAPS4 is much calmer there. He agrees with part of what I told him about @CAPS2 because he knows @CAPS2 @CAPS4 likes to live in @LOCATION1 but he doesn't know I like to live anywhere else. After he told me, he was silent for a few seconds. I noticed something right away. I noticed that our conversation was not what it was at first. At first, we couldn't stop laughing and we had so many funny things to say. Then, @CAPS4 became calmer and somewhat unusual. I didn't want to stop our conversation there so I asked him where he was going because @CAPS6 I started talking to him and he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we're laughing again. This time @CAPS4 because we just noticed that the people we were with have left us. "@CAPS6 Did they leave?" he asked me. "I don't know, but they couldn't have gone that far because we haven't spoken in a long time," I told him. We went to find them together, and I was right. They are not that far. They were still looking for something to buy and I don't think they noticed that we were missing. We just got together with them and acted like @CAPS3 had happened. @CAPS4 is weird to me because whenever I look at him I remember our conversation. My first thought was that our conversation started with an interesting thing he said. I actually enjoy making new friends this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend there, and if I decide to do so, I can make other friends by laughing with them in their conversations.
I started laughing as I waited in the car, eager to meet my best friend and the man I love. Not because my mom or brother said something funny or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I've spoken to him countless times over the phone, countless text messages, and countless emails. But I'm still nervous. I know him better than most, but my anxiety seems to be driving me nuts. I was even more nervous when our black rental car was parked in the waiting area in front of his house. @CAPS6 What if he wasn't actually what I imagined it to be? @CAPS6 If he doesn't like me? @CAPS6 If I don't like him? As soon as he got in the car, he smiled brightly at me, and my nervous laughter and anxiety melted away. I smiled back. "@CAPS1, @PERSON1," he said. "@CAPS1 @PERSON2," I said, panicking. I still smiled brightly, and he reached out and held my hand carefully. "@CAPS3 is the drive?" he asked, squeezing my hand lightly. "@CAPS4, nervous," I replied, nervous laughter again. "@CAPS5 You're here now, and I'm glad @CAPS7," he laughed. For the rest of the drive to the restaurant, our conversation went so well, I thought I was dreaming. Here he and I are two people who are in love, something new for both of us, and we are very happy. We talked the whole car holding hands and I feel like I've known him my whole life. It's not just that I have known him for a year and a half. We got to @ORGANIZATION1 so fast, we all got out of the car, I was hungry and so was he. But we had to wait half an hour to be seated. Once at the dinner table, my mother was so happy that I had found someone I loved so much and knew we loved, and she started to please us with stories from my childhood. It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. I blushed almost the entire time she was telling these stories. Some I remember, some I don't. @PERSON2 laughed and joked with me. It turned my nervous laughter into real laughter. It was also helpful that he held my hand under the table. After dinner and dessert, we went shopping at a nearby mall and went out to play. My mom and brother went one way, @PERSON2 and I went the other way. We bought some clothes together and ended up at a bookstore. My favorite bookstore, @ORGANIZATION3's. Going back to my favorite part, Youth Fiction, I noticed @PERSON2 staring at me. "@CAPS6?" I asked silly. He smiled slyly. "@CAPS7 looks very...in your element," he smirked. "@CAPS8?" I said, pretending to be confused. He just smiled and took my hand again. "@CAPS9 question," he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me close to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. "@CAPS10 If I'm a bit edgy?" he asked. I shake my head @CAPS9. He leaned over and gave me a light kiss on the lips, and I blushed and started giggling as my lips parted. He raised his eyebrows, and I knew @CAPS6 was thinking just from the look on his face. "That feels great," I said, putting my fingers to my lips. There was a smirk on my face. "@CAPS11," he said simply, giving me another kiss. "I love your laugh honey," he told me, I'm on cloud nine, I'm really in love with someone, and I feel great! I've never been so happy before. Except the first time I went to @ORGANIZATION2. But it's definitely better because it lasts longer. It has because we've been together. Our two eyes together determine our future. Now whenever I think about it I start giggling happily to myself. Yes, I get stared at every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter was what helped bridge the gap between him and me. Make us the closest people ever.
The fourth period, freshman year is the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 is what most people call him, but I simply call him @CAPS1. So I will start with the fourth semester of physical science in the first semester of ninth grade. I spent my first semester with my best friends @PERSON1, @CAPS12 and we had to choose our seats so we sat side by side in the back right corner of the classroom. We sit there so we can get away with more like passing notes in class @CAPS12. So one day, when we passed the notebook, I wrote something that embarrassed her. So I pulled something out of my backpack and @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So the next thing I know, I'm being pushed from my desk into my backpack and carried on my back. The class was quiet as he was taking notes for us @CAPS12, showing us how to get homework done. So when we burst out laughing, I looked at him to see if he was pissed @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh at himself, and @CAPS12 started talking again. So, we keep laughing, but we try to settle down @CAPS12 to stop ourselves from laughing. In the second semester, @PERSON1 is with me @CAPS10, but I have my friends @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5. @CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. In the first semester, I was closer to @CAPS1. So, one day he taught us about compounds. So when he was writing a chart to help us learn, he sang, "@CAPS7 play @CAPS8 @CAPS9!" @CAPS10 Even seconds later, the class laughed and even he had to stop writing, He laughed so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 Stop laughing. Another part of the second semester that was fun @CAPS12 had a good laugh at was doing some sample problems ourselves. So one of my classmates @LOCATION2 asked what we should do to tell him that we have solved these problems. So @LOCATION1 thought about it for a while, and @CAPS12 said, "@CAPS11 you've done all your questions and clucked like chickens to me." @CAPS12 After about five minutes, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more and more people complete their problems, it becomes more and more annoying. Although it was hilarious at first. And then @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We only have one normal classroom, @CAPS10 and one science @CAPS13, so we can't do a lot of experiments. So @CAPS15, another science teacher asked us to lend her classroom to the whole school @CAPS14 because her class has an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using matches because he nicknamed me @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the last day, he broke about @NUM1 glass test tubes. @CAPS11 This happened and I'm almost done with the packets I had to do for @CAPS14. So I walked up to him while he was cleaning up and @CAPS12 I asked what was going on. He told me that my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did. So @CAPS11 I looked at him and he started laughing. This exposed his cover so I caught up with him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 blamed the kids for what he did. Especially for breaking test tubes. Another time I went to his @CAPS18 class to do homework. My friend wanted me to spend a day there because she liked the class so much. So my guitar class teacher allowed me to spend my fifth class in that class. So, @CAPS11 he has completed @CAPS12's notes and assigned the class for the day's homework. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him to ask questions. So I looked up from my painting. By then, he had been by their side. So they asked him if he could swim and he replied that he could. They then asked him if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I thought he was embarrassed so he said @CAPS12 asked some personal questions after class. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained about five minutes that they shouldn't waste class time answering stupid @CAPS12 personal questions about him. I kept thinking, "Didn't @CAPS20 just say yes or no?" @CAPS21 was a fun time I'll never forget the day @CAPS12 told me to die. No course or science course will replace the fourth term in Physical Science. No teacher has ever replaced @LOCATION1, he is @CAPS12 and will always be my favorite teacher. I will always remember the days of every physical science class because of a simple teacher.
Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or @CAPS3 is embarrassed and they're not sure what else to do. People usually laugh when they @CAPS3 are embarrassed or offended. In fact, I sometimes laugh for no reason. If I can make people laugh, I usually feel accomplished. I think it personally expresses emotion out loud. However, in some cases, you can't help but laugh at yourself. Every year, since I moved here when I was six and @DATE1, my two cousins and I go to "Cheese Ball Carols" with our grandparents around @CAPS1. Even after my grandfather passed away on @DATE4 and my sister left for college. On the twenty-first day of @DATE2, we secretly @LOCATION1 shopped one at a time with one of our grandparents while we handmade cheese balls. After all five of us were gone, we wrapped the cheese ball and tied a ribbon on it while we practiced our carols for that night. We always make a list before we start singing carols. The first thing on the list is who we @CAPS3 are going to be at the house that night. The second next to each household name is the number of cheese balls we will be shipping to that particular house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 will sing to them. Usually, there are about twenty-five to thirty people on the list. All these @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or staff. We also always have a good time. No fights or arguments or anything like that. It was great to be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been a year or so since we all got together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went to Carol with my sister. She previously went to college on @DATE3, leaving my eldest grandson there. At first it didn't seem to make any difference, but over time I could feel it was picking up on it. With her gone, my grandpa was no longer around and the pressure increased uncontrollably. When we started, I started to relax a bit and just wanted to have some fun. My grandma told me to go get the list and add a name. At first, I thought nothing of it. She told us later that we had to write a special song for the family. That's when it hit me. The name looks and sounds familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to confirm if it was the same family. Sure enough, it did. I've been in love with this boy for as long as I can remember. However, we lost touch after I found out he liked my cousin. I knew it would be very embarrassing, let alone embarrassing, to sing in front of him. I remember thinking "@CAPS2 is awesome, this is exactly what I need. This is going to be awesome." We did the tour and it all went really well. We had fun, joked and laughed about everything. Then it was time to go to "his" home. We all choked up. The girls heard a lot about how cute and dreamy the boy was, so they were nervous too. We sat in the truck and told ourselves he wasn't going to be home, and even if he was home, we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk ever to a house with such a short walk. My grandmother rang the doorbell and we were ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered the question. We are freezing! We stared at him like gargoyles. He gave us a weird look and said "@CAPS3 are you going to sing or stand there?" with a wicked little smile. I did try to sing but nothing came of it. That's when the youngest cousin started singing Happy Birthday. That's not the song we planned for the house, nor his birthday. In the middle of the second "Happy Birthday to you" we all started laughing, I don't mean giggling or giggling. We @CAPS3 laughed hysterically until we couldn't breathe, he closed the door. I know it would have made that memory even scarier if we just stood there, but since we were all laughing, we could look back and laugh for ourselves. Laughter was a great way to release the emotional stress inside of me that I realized that night. This is a memory I believe we will never forget. I've done something similar many times, but this is definitely number one on my list of "what are you thinking" moments. I will not change anything.
Laughing is always the key to achieving happiness, all you really need to do is laugh to be happy. I remember being a freshman in @NUM1 grade, I can tell you for sure, I don't know where the real stuff is, it was a new school: new buses, new everything. No one wants to be a freshman, you'll be teased by a lot of people, and sometimes you just don't fit in. That's my story, I'll never fit in. One day I walked up the stairs to go to class, and it turned out to be a sunny day, and I didn't believe it was really cloudy that day. Anyway, when I was walking up the stairs, I tripped and fell back, the skirt I was wearing was flipped over my head, and of course in those days you had to have statement panties. Well, I remember everyone pointing at me and laughing A. Because I just fell, @CAPS1. Because I'm wearing Dora's panties. So, I laughed with everyone all day, but honestly, I laughed with them. Honestly, I thought it was funny, fell down and your panties were exposed? Who doesn't think this is fun? Afterwards, this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me I wasn't the only one wearing statement panties. We both had a great laugh that day and just remembered the fact that I was one of them all and I fell down the stairs! Next, as a new kid that might actually be embarrassing, but for me, I've done it a million times, so it didn't bother me as much as one might think. @CAPS2 and I, became great friends and we laughed all the time. Like when she fell into icy water when we went to the park, or back when I fell down the stairs. We're still talking about this to this day, it's just something you really can't get over. Not to mention it's funny when my character panties show up. In conclusion, I think when the saying "laughing is the shortest distance between two people" is really true, it's a well-known fact that you have to laugh before you can get on with your day. If you don't laugh all day, then you really have a problem. Just because you're getting older doesn't mean you have to ditch your laughter. Laughter is part of the day you can do whatever you want. So you told me what's your funny story?
@ORGANIZATION1 surprised me when I first met her. She is my other half. Everything we do together is perfect. Every word she said made me laugh. She is my other half and she will sum it all up. I still remember the first time I saw her at @CAPS1. The town is nicknamed @CAPS1 @CAPS4 Hell because of its remote location. I met @CAPS1 on vacation. My parents just retired a few months ago and are looking for a comfortable retirement home away from the big city, closer to the @LOCATION2 mountains east of @CAPS4, it looks like @CAPS4 always has snow caps and beautiful views. We ended up spending a week or so in this little trailer that we carry with us. That thing is hell on earth and I let @CAPS4 set everything up every time we stop, even if we don't go to @CAPS4 to use it. It's a two hour process, and after the hundredth time you'll see I'm going to get bored. @CAPS4 It's not hard to live in a nice house in that town @CAPS4 here comes. They are all amazing home made homes. No contractor ever paid @CAPS4 to build these houses because the townspeople do it by hand. They are incredible two-story oak homes that look like they can withstand a tornado with only scratches. We ended up finding this house so awesome that I wanted @CAPS4 to live there right away, and amazingly my parents wanted it @CAPS4. But sadly, we let @CAPS4 sell our house first, otherwise @CAPS4 couldn't afford it, so we put the house on "@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6" and went back to the @CAPS4 trailer. We spent another @NUM1 or so days there and I was officially bored. I need @CAPS4 to do something other than store the fire and make sure the hotdog isn't burning. I hopped on my dad's bike and rode into town (the trailer park is about half a mile outside of town). I arrived in town @CAPS4 very disappointed. Cycling around town and stopping at the shop @CAPS4 to chat is as boring as sitting by the fire in @NUM2 degree weather. It's just another boring vacation in my opinion, but little did I know it's about @CAPS4 having more fun. I woke up the next day, took a shower, and got ready for the day. From what I can tell, it seems like another boring day in hell. @CAPS4 I'm glad I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do. But at the time @CAPS1 and similar didn't cut it because all I did was @DATE1 went to places like @CAPS4 and did nothing, so I expected @CAPS4 to be bored. I was riding my bike around a corner and saw a bunch of boys and girls who looked like they just came from fishing or tubing or some fun, so I rode on @CAPS4 to see what was going on. I started talking about @CAPS4 a guy named @CAPS8. He told me they had just come back from a youth group where they got together on snakes and they went to tubing and cliff jumping. I am aw. This seems crazy @CAPS4 to me. Jump off a cliff? pipeline? For a youth group, @CAPS4 seems crazy. But I guess that's how they do things in @CAPS1. They just don't go to picnics, they go to crazy things and I personally haven't done anything they say because one I'm not crazy and two I never get a chance. We kept talking and before they left they invited me @CAPS4 to go on a nature hike on this top of the mountain. I'm glad @CAPS4 sees that I love hiking. I woke up at @TIME1 feeling whole energized and ready to rock @CAPS4. I signed the permit form and was ready for an enjoyable hike. I rode my dad's bike into town @TIME1 at 5, just in time for the youth manager's house, just in time for a protein shake for breakfast (he gave it @CAPS4 I didn't ask). We drove @CAPS4 up the hill and around the base there were @NUM3 @CAPS4 @NUM4 guys all wearing climbing gear. It surprised me because I didn't expect so many people. That's when I met @LOCATION1. She's beautiful, so I was instantly drawn to @CAPS4 her. We started climbing and I started @CAPS4 talking to @CAPS4 her. We are like two piss in a pod. I can't get enough of her and her me. Her laughter made me very happy. She is my other half. I just remember her amazing laugh.
` @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 story about how I fell in dog @CAPS1 and stepped on it and I fell off a slippery trampoline. About four or five years ago, I went to live @TIME1 at a friend's house. It was a hot day so my friend and I made a plan to have fun and stay cool so my friend and I went to the garage and found the sprinkler so we decided to put the sprinkler under the trampoline and when you do At times it makes the trampoline wet and slippery. My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline, he started jumping higher than me, and I started losing stretch, he came back at the same time as me, but he had more stretch, which made my stretch a lot higher than usual, and he could also Is it heavier than me? So I came back and I landed on my back and the angle I was on the trampoline knocked me off. I thought I was going to get hurt when I was bounced off the trampoline, I'd rather get bruised and land on dog shit but that's what happened and I landed on a pile of dog shit and it really made me My shirt stinks so it's not good but after I took off my shirt I started dancing again and I danced all day but I don't regret it because after that everyone had a good laugh including me. So @CAPS3's story is part of laughter, and laughter is a great way to have fun, and even if @MONTH1 was a bad thing that happened to you, maybe it ended up being funny, even though it wasn't at the time.
@CAPS9 Have you ever been scared to sleep all night? Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends? Telling scary stories can be a fun game until someone gets too scared and terrifies everyone. It starts when everyone is watching movies and having fun until the time when the parents are up the stairs and partying. It's called our "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" night and we call it "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" because we @CAPS5 kids, we consider ourselves @CAPS1. Our night involved @NUM2's disturbed @LOCATION1, @NUM1's frightened teens, and a house said to be "@CAPS6". In order to start this amazing night of horror, guests must arrive first. Everyone arrived at my house around NUM4 in the afternoon. We start by playing video games, laughing, having fun, eating, playing board games. Just your average teen party. That's it, until the parents go upstairs to sleep. Once they settled in bed and fell asleep, we pulled out the "@CAPS7 or @CAPS8" game. I bet you thought we'd be immature seedlings and play the unrated version, didn't you? Well, luckily we are @CAPS5 kids. Just your normal "I @CAPS8 you ran three laps around the house" or "@CAPS9 did you ever kiss someone?". Nothing to judge. After a while, everyone got tired of playing that extra game, so we moved on to the next activity, which was to play sing-star on @NUM5, but @LOCATION3 had the wrong wire, so we couldn't connect the console. Since this didn't go as planned, we started chatting and taking photos of @CAPS1. Since this is our "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" it is absolutely necessary to take some photos of us all as @CAPS1. For our @CAPS1 characters it goes like this, I am the father, @PERSON3 is the mother, @LOCATION3 is the cat, @PERSON8 is @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @ CAPS13 and @PERSON6 are my children, @PERSON1 is my brother, @PERSON7 is a strange brutal woman, @PERSON4 is my sister-in-law, and @LOCATION2 is our cable guy. That's how we think about each other in @CAPS1, so we all have to be photographed in outfits that match our character traits. It took a while for everyone to focus and stop arguing with each other, but we managed to work together and keep shooting. After taking pictures, it was time to satisfy our appetite. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM6 different big pizzas. Hawaiian Airlines, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2 and @CAPS20. One by one, we all kept coming back. My "daughter" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza on the carpet, leaving a huge red stain. We all started to hesitate. @PERSON9 got the cleaners, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, @PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures as we scrub for life. After cleaning up the mess, we stopped eating and put everything else away. It's @CAPS23 movie time. Hugging with @NUM1 people and snuggling on the couch is the "right" way to think about @CAPS23 movies. The movie we chose is called @CAPS24. Everyone sitting on top of everyone is fun until someone has to use the bathroom. And then it all happened... When @PERSON4 got up to go to the bathroom, @CAPS25 was off, all the lights in the house were off, and we kept noticing shadows passing over the living room walls. @CAPS13 started crying, @LOCATION2 was complaining, @PERSON4 didn't go to the bathroom, I was freaking out. Since none of the lights would come back on, we all formed a circle on the rug and started telling truly horrific stories. Most of them are truly honest, while others are considered mythical. @PERSON6 paints a story of a possessed @CAPS26 who has no left leg and walks around intimidating pedestrians. Well, it so happens that I have a @LOCATION1 without a left leg, and when we started telling this story, my @LOCATION1 started freaking out and attacking all my guests. So I grabbed my dog whistle, ordered them to stop, and fired. After all the commotion, my parents never woke up and we both rushed to my room to continue the @CAPS23 story. The main lesson throughout @CAPS2 is that you can overcome any fear as long as you @CAPS9 have laughter and friends to support you, that's what happens at parties. We were just hysterical about the whole situation, no one would be alone, always comforting them with laughter. I will @CAPS9 say this is by far my favorite and funniest party I @CAPS9 ever had.
Laughter and enthusiasm are key elements of any good relationship. It's a comfort to be able to feel dizzy and happy with someone close to @CAPS11. It often brings people closer together and helps cement their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago, when I was in @PERSON1's 7th grade math class at @ORGANIZATION1, I was selected for @ORGANIZATION2 and three other classmates. Joining @ORGANIZATION2 simply means we will teach ourselves @CAPS1-@CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @PERSON1 will teach the rest of the class simpler, simpler math. @ORGANIZATION2 is almost like an elite club. The rest of our classmates looked at us jealously because we were going to sit together at the back of the classroom, never having to do any homework, and never being suddenly asked to answer questions in front of the class. As immature seventh graders, we abused the incredible opportunities we had at @TIME1. I became good friends with three other people in @ORGANIZATION2. Their names are @PERSON4, @PERSON3 and @CAPS3. @PERSON4 and I are already friends, but it's working together in @ORGANIZATION2 that really brings us closer together. I'm also close to @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3. As of @TIME1's day, @PERSON4 is one of my best friends and I'm still in touch with the other two. We are all very different from each other. @PERSON3 is attracted to the masses, @CAPS3 often plays chess and reads with really smart kids, @PERSON4 and I are normal. However, we all have two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and intelligence. Each of us finds our self-taught job too easy. We read through the book handily and never really had any problems. When doing @CAPS8, we always finish our assignments quickly, leaving more than half of the class sitting there eating and passing the time. That doesn't necessarily mean that's how things work out. "@PERSON4, I don't want to do math @DATE2. I'm beaten," I complained as I walked into @PERSON1's math room after lunch. "Neither did @CAPS6," she replied. "I said we just sat there and made it look like it was working." We went to the back table where @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 were already sitting. They took out books, pencils, and spirals of paper, but sat there with expressionless faces. @PERSON4 I sat down with them and we both exchanged displeased looks. "@CAPS8 Ugh, I was talking to @LOCATION1 @TIME1 and he said we don't have to do any work on @DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out," I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Next, @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 grinned. @PERSON3 turns around and pulls out a kraft paper bag from his backpack. She started taking food out of the bag and handing it all to us. I immediately grabbed the mini chocolate pies. Halfway through the meal, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and rubbed a big chunk on the window behind @CAPS6. @PERSON4 noticed and immediately started chuckling. "@CAPS10, what is that?!" she cried, loud enough that everyone in the class could hear it. @PERSON1 took a look with a few classmates and soon returned to class. It wasn't really funny at all, but all four of us laughed. "@CAPS11 guys, I have @TIME1 crazy dreams @TIME2," @PERSON3 said, laughter fading. "I went to the @TIME1 @DATE1 camp thing, @PERSON2 is one of the camp counselors. He's wearing khaki pants and a blue pinstripe white shirt. Oh, and he's got a clipboard!" We looked at her blankly , and then burst out laughing again. The funny thing about @TIME1 is that @PERSON2 often replaces our teacher and he wears the exact same outfit every time. But what's more interesting is that it's really not funny at all. We @CAPS8 are dying to have a good time and we find the chocolate specks and khakis on the windows funny. Our laughter came to an abrupt end, and we sat there quietly. Suddenly, @CAPS3 leaned against his squeaky swivel chair, which broke immediately and he fell straight to the ground. For everyone else, @TIME1 will be fun. Yet each of us sat in silence, staring at each other. It's not that we feel embarrassed or sympathetic for him, it's just ironic that something outdated made us laugh and a substantial, ridiculous event made us just sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget @ORGANIZATION2. It was a waste of time, but we had a good laugh. We @MONTH1 didn't learn a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other.
Lots of @CAPS1 Laughing People always say that laughter can do a lot of good. The truth, I believe, is that laughter is not always the best. Laughter can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles, happiness and memories. Although, having a memory of laughter doesn't prove that's true. "@CAPS2, I really don't want to be here. I don't know I can stay here and tell him this," I begged @CAPS11 mom to let @CAPS6 me go home. "@CAPS3 needs to do this darling. @CAPS8 is the best." @CAPS4 I always think @CAPS11 mom knows that best. Now, I'm not so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back tears, waiting for @CAPS11 dad to return to his house. I knew he was at the bar and silently thanked him for giving me time to think. I should go tell him how I feel about him drinking all the time. Every time I go there, I see him either drunk or on his way there. The truth is, I am scared. I'm afraid of his health, afraid that I'm the reason he drinks. I'm getting old and need to tell him my thoughts and feelings. Distracted by this awareness, he rushed through the door. I looked up at @CAPS11's drunk dad and @CAPS11's heart fell. I burst into tears when @CAPS11 Mom held me in her arms. "@CAPS5...@CAPS8 it's okay," she reassured. @CAPS11 Father looked at me blankly and walked into another room. I went into the room he was in and watched him carefully through the open door. He is no longer the man @CAPS11 mom used to marry. He has turned into a monster. I can't take it anymore @CAPS8. I walked into @CAPS11's mom's room with worry in her eyes. "@CAPS6 is home," I said. On the way home, I was sobbing until a tear ran down @CAPS11's shirt. There was silence in the car on the way home, thoughts and sadness in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun is on @CAPS11's face as I wake up for the new day. I feel confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS11 @CAPS9 how I've been feeling. We drove back to his house and nervousness came over us as we pulled into the driveway. I staggered to the door and knocked. "@CAPS7. Hey." @CAPS8 What bothers me is that @CAPS11 dad acted as if nothing was wrong. I walked in confidently and asked him to sit down. I'm satisfied that I caught him in a rare moment of not being drunk. "@CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel like @CAPS3 made a huge mistake with drinking. I know @CAPS10 is addicted and it's risky to stop, but @CAPS3 is also endangering @CAPS10's health!" I was basically right He yelled. I poured my heart out to @CAPS11 and a whole new tear came to my heart. When I finished @CAPS11, my dad sat there with a blank look on his face. He laughed. "@CAPS10 Mom asked @CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry @CAPS8. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 don't know what she's talking about." @CAPS11's jaw dropped as he acted like it wasn't serious. Anger boiled in my heart. "@CAPS3 doesn't even know me! @CAPS3 doesn't even care about me!" I screamed and rushed out. I walked into the living room and looked directly at @CAPS11 mom who somehow knew I wanted to leave. This time, the driving in the car seemed to be silent again. The thought that laughter is almost always a good thing makes me cry because only once, laughter doesn't mean happiness. @CAPS8 means tears.
Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 "@CAPS5, we have something to tell @CAPS3." I know @CAPS9 they have something to tell me. I see signs. I know @CAPS8 they went into another room and @CAPS6 didn't have a great time together. They are divorcing @CAPS11 and it's time to tell me it's coming. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew they were going to say something I wasn't ready to hear. "We're getting a divorce" is ringing in my head like church bells @CAPS8 A couple is getting married. The happiest voice @CAPS3 could hear. But that's the exact opposite of what's happening now with @CAPS9. When I looked up at my mother's face, I could see she was crying. Where the blue, grey mixture that meets @CAPS11 becomes one, @CAPS6 turns red and @CAPS11 fidgets. @CAPS6 killed me seeing her crying, @CAPS11 when this happened my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head in his hands. I can tell he's thinking that he loves @CAPS11 so much that @CAPS6 is going downhill, making him have a strong resentment for @CAPS11's anger at my mother. The love of his life is now his enemy. At seven, I couldn't fully understand what @CAPS9 happened to our family. I know a parent will move out, I don't always get stuffed into bed with a pair of love at night, I just don't understand @CAPS7 this has to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain to him. If I'm confused, he must be on another planet. The thought of my family crumbling before my eyes makes me want to cry. I want to stay away from the troubles that happen at home. If there was a genie out there that fulfilled my three wishes, if I thought it was possible to save my parents' relationship, I would use those three wishes. Crying seems so much easier than sitting in the living room and listening to my parents say "@CAPS6 is not your fault, don't blame yourself, it's your dad @CAPS11 between me". @CAPS7 Do they think these statements make @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 doesn't really help. My parents have lost their love for each other, @CAPS11 I hope their hopes of getting back together will be reduced faster than the number of rainforests left in @LOCATION1. Also, there is a potential factor that my home is broken. @CAPS11 is more important than my home and my heart. @CAPS6 broke @CAPS11 I don't think there is enough super glue in the world to put the pieces back together. Just @CAPS8 @CAPS6 it feels like the whole world is going to fall on me and my mom said something to me that I @CAPS1 will never forget. “@CAPS8 @CAPS3 Want to cry, want to laugh. Remembering all the good times we had as a family.” One by one, each memory started pouring into my mind. @CAPS8 Dad jumped into the pile of leaves we swept together. @CAPS8 Mom @CAPS11 My time making sugar cookies in the winter ended up getting burnt but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS11 familiar. @CAPS11 Especially the wedding that got them both married. A sacred bond that only a priest can create to people. People who changed their lives forever @CAPS11 mine. I started laughing, @CAPS11 and cried. My parents weren't sure if @CAPS9 would consider my sudden mood change. They asked, "@CAPS9 was wrong, @CAPS10?" @CAPS11 I, still thought none of those memories would be there, and then I realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, we would still laugh. @CAPS8 Someone slips on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 will be fun. No more tears pouring out of my eyes like dams in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 finally realized we'll be fine. There is laughter in life and memories of @CAPS11 in our hearts, we will get through it. Since then, I have only believed what my mother said to me. "@CAPS8 @CAPS3 wants to cry and laugh." said to me, @CAPS6 can be sad, but as long as @CAPS3 has laughter in your life, @CAPS1 everything will be fine. In my heart, I applaud my mom for handling this situation so well. If @CAPS6 hadn't been for her, I'd have continued working in water @CAPS11 wouldn't have stopped to think about all the happy times we've had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to take a little time each day to remember every cliché joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.
Laughter, pure happiness. The moment you're at @CAPS1, nothing else matters, all your worries @CAPS1 stress will go away, leaving you with a truly happy self. Have you ever had those moments when everything seemed too much? Then a friend says something that makes you laugh, and once you're done laughing you start crying because it feels good to laugh. Or when you laugh so hard you fall to the floor @CAPS1 and can't seem to get up for hours? Looking back, however, you forget what was so funny. The laughter is amazing and there is love behind @CAPS7. The two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just your boyfriend/girlfriend, but your friends @CAPS1 family, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, @CAPS1 brings you closer . When I'm with my @CAPS16 friends, one of the things we seem to do the most is laugh. We laugh at anything @CAPS1 is even a little funny. It brings us closer together, sharing happy moments. The six of us are very close @CAPS1 will be friends after the high @ORGANIZATION1 ends, even though we are thousands of miles away in college. This is because we shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other @CAPS1 to share anything, even our most important secrets. This story is how we became so close. Brightly colored fancy dress @CAPS1 killer heels splayed across the room. Open soda can @CAPS1 bag of chips. The faint smell of nail polish, floral fragrance, @CAPS1 deodorant lingers in the air. Laughter @CAPS1 bubbled up the room with giggles and occasional screams. It was dark outside, but the light @CAPS1 warmed up. The six of us were hanging out in the room. Applying makeup @CAPS1 deflated the hair. Sweatpants @CAPS1 loose tee. Within a few minutes, we all went from doing our best to... no. However, none of us cared. When we look at each other, we can @CAPS17 past looks are funny to each other, not their looks. We just got back from @ORGANIZATION1. Neither of us dated, but we still managed to get through the time of our lives. "@CAPS1, did you see him! He's dancing with her!" "I wouldn't really call it dancing..." She did a pelvic thrust and we all exploded into a new round of Giggling @CAPS1 shouting, "@CAPS2, get a room!" We gossip about what we see, who's with whom, nice clothes, hot @CAPS4, creepers @CAPS4, slow dance, music, even Our @CAPS8, we hide the mugs so we know which is ours when we want to use them again. We are all friends, but recently we have become closer. Start going from friend to best friend. At least @NUM1 @CAPS3. Everyone's exhausted but forcing themselves to stay up all night drinking caffeine @CAPS1 sugar. You @MONTH1 ask why, but I'm not quite sure. Maybe it's because we always seem to have a lot to say, because we love each other's company, or just because we can, so why not? "@CAPS4 I think we need a picture, a picture of the six of us," I said. "@CAPS5!" "@CAPS6" "@CAPS7 now? I'm a mess!" "I have this stuff!" @PERSON1 ran upstairs to get something. "@CAPS8 should we sit?""@CAPS9 bed?""@CAPS10, @CAPS5! Roll over the fat guy""@CAPS11! I'm not fat, I'm festive and plump! " We were all struck by the reference to @LOCATION1 when sizing a corner of the bed. @PERSON1 @CAPS1 @PERSON1's mom is back in the room. @PERSON1 with an old @ORGANIZATION2 camera that prints out as soon as you take a photo. She gave the camera to her mom @CAPS1 and jumped on the bed @CAPS9. We were all huddled together with barely enough breathing room. "One...two...three!" @CAPS12! The picture is out. "@CAPS13 get another one while the first one is in development. Again, one...two...three!" @CAPS14! @CAPS12! "@CAPS15!!!" we all screamed in unison. The bed is broken! We broke the bed! We all sat there, cuddling each other in complete shock. "@CAPS16 bed! You @CAPS4 are awesome..." @PERSON1 said as he tried to control his laughter. Suddenly, we fell into hysteria. Even @PERSON1's mom is laughing. We were a whole bunch of throbbing laughter. Only the corner of the bed was broken, so we were all pulled into that corner. Then someone starts tickling, and that's war. Every girl is for herself. It was a pile of sheets, wiggly fingers, bare feet, biting @CAPS1 and laughing a lot. "@CAPS17 pics developed." The first is of us sitting and smiling, but the second was taken when the bed was just broken. It showed @CAPS9 the shock on our faces as we leaned on each other for support. Not only did it bring us closer, but it also started our amazing friendship.
Laughter really is an important part of everyone's day. For whatever reason, humans love to laugh, and they love to make others laugh. But it reminds me of an interesting story...I had to take a writing test once. In fact, the test is very much like this. In fact, this is it. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them are as vague as possible, which makes choosing one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a full fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I had to write one of four things, and none of them were even a little funny. For some reason I find my problem situation interesting because I'm kind of weird. But then it hit me...one of the four themes was about laughing...why not write my own sarcasm laughing at my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story that I had laughed at, so I used that delightful ambiguity to my advantage. The topic doesn't say that laughter has to be audible laughter or what kind of laughter it has to be, so I think silent laughter for sarcasm is the same as laughter for dumb things good. So now I have my topic. To make things more interesting, when I wrote that I was laughing because I had to write that I was laughing, I started laughing at how stupid the task I was doing was. However, I'm starting to worry that the people who grade this stuff at @MONTH1 won't find it as interesting as I do, and it might affect my grades. But this possibility only makes the situation more ironic and thus interesting. You @MONTH1 think I'm easily amused, but to that I have to say: Well, yeah, I kind of. I can find pretty much anything funny, but I've found that that's the beauty of laughter. It's so abstract that everyone experiences it differently. Some people @MONTH1 find very simple things quite funny, but others @MONTH1 are not so easily amused. These differences are part of what makes interacting with others so enjoyable. As I said before, humans love to laugh, and we love to have others laugh with us. No matter how you @MONTH1 interpret the abstract form of laughter, you have to admit it: it's funny.
Someone once told me that laughter is the key to comfort. I believe @CAPS7 is one of the most important parts of any relationship. @CAPS7 brings people together. A perfect example; in the fall of about two years ago, I cried over the death of my dog. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better, but nothing worked. I was hurt and I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he walked away, he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants @CAPS1 when @ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back was soaked wet. His cheeks turned cherry red from embarrassment. I just laughed, I couldn't resist @CAPS7. He saw that I was covered in water and he started laughing. That's the comfort of laughter. We can always laugh off @CAPS7 whenever we have a problem. That's how I know him. I went out with a few friends and we decided to watch a movie called Step-@CAPS2. One time I saw one of the characters say, "@CAPS3 @CAPS3 is so funny, last time I heard I laughed so hard I fell off a dinosaur," and then another character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie, my friend @PERSON1 suggested we go back to his house. When we got there, @CAPS4 was waiting for @PERSON1's steps. @PERSON1 stood for a while, then said, "Are you waiting for me, little guy." @CAPS4 replied, "@CAPS3 @CAPS3 so funny, last time I heard I laughed so hard I fell off a dinosaur Down." I laughed so hard I almost went to the toilet by myself. @CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing, we just clicked. If he wasn't funny, I can honestly say I would never be with him. I love to laugh. I believe @CAPS7 is the easiest way to trigger the best emotions.
@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is a true story about a time I had with my two friends/squad members @PERSON3 and @PERSON1. When we do @CAPS3 cheerleading practice on @DATE1 @TIME1. @CAPS3 @NUM1 We had a great laugh and I started getting colds because we were wearing shorts and sweatshirts, @CAPS8 we were wearing @CAPS1 headscarves. @CAPS6 @PERSON3 wants @CAPS3 to wear her hood too, @CAPS8 she's not alone but her hood @CAPS3 is small and has thick hair which will only make her worse. @CAPS8 She's tired @CAPS3 Wear a hat anyway, hair on top and curls on bottom. @CAPS8 She looks like a poodle when she wears the hat. When we got @CAPS3 I lived at the end of the block @PERSON1 said her foot hurt, @CAPS8 I told her I would give her a piggy back. @CAPS8 she leaned on my back and I told her @CAPS13 we got @CAPS3 end of the block let me down and we can cross the street @CAPS6 give me a piggyback, @CAPS8 @PERSON1 give me a piggyback ride. @CAPS8 @CAPS6 We told @PERSON3 it was her turn and now it was my turn as we walked through! "@CAPS6 I'm like "@CAPS7 @PERSON1. Well @PERSON3 give me your backpack and water bottle. ” @CAPS8 @PERSON3 gave her @CAPS3 stuff to me, and gave @PERSON1 a pony. @CAPS6 @CAPS13 We got the end of the @CAPS3 block and I told @PERSON3 she now let @CAPS3 give me a piggyback .@CAPS6 @PERSON3 is like "@CAPS9! I'm tired @CAPS3" At the end of that conversation, she gave me what I wanted. At the end of the last block, @PERSON3 let me down, @CAPS6 we crossed the road. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 drove After we shouted "@CAPS10! " @CAPS6 We turned to @CAPS3 to see who was yelling at us and we found it was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 I said "@CAPS12 Look it's @PERSON2!" She was actually on time! ” @CAPS13 @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON2 We, the three of us girls started @CAPS3 just laughing. We started @CAPS3 laughing because of @PERSON2 yelling at us. When @PERSON2 went to @CAPS3 to park her car , we just started walking @CAPS3 her @CAPS3 talking to @CAPS3 her because she was getting off. @CAPS8 We just got @CAPS3 her car when @PERSON2 got off. She walked to @CAPS3 us and we started @CAPS3 talk and walk into the school where we practice. As we walk, I say @CAPS3 @PERSON2 "@CAPS5 is actually on time! ” @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 responded by saying “I know? ! " We finally got the @CAPS3 door @PERSON2 said "@CAPS12 everyone was here today!" " @CAPS8 That's when I had a good laugh with more @CAPS6 alone. Going to practice @CAPS3 that night was awesome. Going to @CAPS3 cheerleading practice that night was awesome. Hope @CAPS3 does @CAPS3 again Practice will be fun.
Freshmen @CAPS1 All freshmen @CAPS1 are fun @CAPS1. One boy made me smile. I swear I am in love. We took a class together. This is called @CAPS2. Passing each other in the hallway will just be my @DATE1. We met in a class that neither of us liked. I would ask him for help, even if I don't need it just to talk to him. We'll meet in the pool too because his brother can swim and so can I. I'll see him during @DATE1, but not very often. Instead of him "helping" me, we would sit and talk about our lives at school and at home. The first semester was over and he left the class and entered another class. We still talk poolside and see everyone during school @DATE1. He will now give me hugs in the hallway. We started to become really close friends. The conversation brought us closer. Laughter is an important part of our conversation. We found that we have a lot in common. Like hunting, biking, and food, favorite dogs and our personalities are so similar that we seem to have grown up around each other. @MONTH1 Another month of school. I started going to his house every once in a while. He often comes to my house. I asked him to come with me at the start of the @DATE4 strawberry festival. He said yes, his parents went too, but with my parents. @DATE3 interesting. @DATE4 is finally over, @DATE1 is out of school. Summer vacation is here. @DATE1 @DATE1 at school is fun. It's great to have no homework on @DATE3 or a week. All we do at school @DATE1 is sign @CAPS1 books and tell interesting stories about @CAPS1 schools. After school I went to practice swimming and he was still waiting for his brother in the pool after practice. We were chatting outside and suddenly I don't know where he asked me "Will you go out with me"? I say yes! He made me one of the happiest girls in the world @DATE1. Today, on @DATE2, we are still dating. The only relationship I've ever had. I wish we @DATE1. He tells me almost every @DATE1 that he is marrying me. He told me he didn't know what he would do without me. I tell everyone I swear I'm in love. Now everyone knows I'm in love. I fell in love at first sight. We were always talking and laughing and almost never arguing.
When I was young, I liked to go fishing. I always go with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1. We like to grab the heads of @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while camping. One day we were poaching @CAPS2 and it wasn't going well. It was cold and even snowing. We were about to leave @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled at me that he'd catch this, so I jumped off the quad and ran towards him. When I saw this fish I thought it was @CAPS1. This is by far the largest @CAPS2 head we've seen. When he rolled it in he said it was very powerful and I could see he was in trouble. After a few minutes, he started catching fish from the shore. We all started to relax and think the day would be fine now. Just as @PERSON1 told me to get the net, he slipped and fell straight into the river and he let go of the pole. At the time I thought we lost a fish and a pole, but @PERSON1 didn't figure it out, he jumped into the water behind the pole. One time @PERSON2 I saw him swimming and struggling and we decided to jump in and help him catch a fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water behind a pole and I was almost there. Just when I was about a foot from the pole, the fish started to swim faster. When I was trying to get the pole, I wasn't focusing on where I was going, I got caught by a tree, so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole. The chase for the floating rod has been going on for over five minutes now, and we're all far down the river. Now @PERSON2 is very close to pole and @PERSON1 and I are chasing him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the rod, so we all swam to the shore to fish. At this point we are so glad we went chasing this fish in the icy river and we can't wait to go home to dry it. Minutes later, @PERSON2 is still fishing big. He said he did not know how to bring it to shore. Once the fish was very close to shore, @PERSON2 yanked the rod hard and put it to the shore, but when he pulled the line, the line broke and the fish ran away. All our efforts are for nothing. After that, we decided it was time to go home and sit by the fire. A lot of the people I told this story thought it was funny, but personally I don't think there's anything funny about breaking your line by swimming in the snow. One good thing is that this was the most memorable fishing day I've ever had.
Once I was at @ORGANIZATION1's overnight she wanted to sleep in a tent. @CAPS2 is @DATE1 and we always try to see each other anytime because she has to go back to boarding school a lot. So her mother set up a tent for us on the deck, and after we had dinner, we grabbed our stuff and went out. She's on the phone with her boyfriend, I'm on the phone with my boyfriend, and they're both best friends. @CAPS2 Like two best friends dating two best friends, we are closer than ever. My boyfriend had to hang up because he works at @TIME1 so @CAPS2 is just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying something really funny and she started laughing so hard that she snorted while she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point, I was just laughing out loud and @ORGANIZATION1 started laughing harder because she saw me laughing and pissing herself while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot she was on the phone with him and started laughing harder after that so all this happened at about 1am @TIME1 and I'm surprised her mom didn't come out and yell Yell us out loud. When I looked back and saw that she had pissed herself, I yelled "@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pissed your self @ORGANIZATION1!" @CAPS2 was the funniest thing I've ever laughed in my life so smart. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said "@CAPS3 should take care of that" and they hung up. She was really embarrassed after that, I mean, if this happened to me, I would be embarrassed too.
@ORGANIZATION1 is one of the many joys I love to share with people. I absolutely love to laugh, and if I didn't laugh, I don't know where I would be. My cousin; @CAPS1 and I usually spend most of @DATE1 together and the truth is we shouldn't be drinking energy drinks. Daddy of @CAPS1; @PERSON1, gave us a monster to split and we're going to @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1 that day. About ten minutes after we drank, the whole monster drank, and I was the one who drank the most and was the one who kept calm. On the other hand, @CAPS1 is going crazy after a few sips. She was running up and down the aisle, tripping over her own feet. She nearly tipped the cart over with me. It's normal for @ORGANIZATION1 to be hysterical for no reason. Wendy; @PERSON1's wife and my second cousin are starting to get hungry, so we go to the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe there for pizza. My mom called me and I was trying to get my phone out of my pocket to answer while trying to grab my hot pizza pan. I passed the plate to @CAPS1 because my plate slipped out of my hand. Her other hand was holding her food and she touched the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it on to @PERSON1 and he didn't pay attention, he didn't catch it well , my pizza fell to the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing for everyone to look at us. After that awkward moment, @PERSON1 realized he forgot the churos, so he told @CAPS1 to get them. After @CAPS1 left, all three of us realized his mistake, because @CAPS1 is a douchebag, we might say @CAPS1 might drop them". We're a little surprised she hasn't dropped them yet, we just thought, she dropped them On the table, one of the churros fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We @ORGANIZATION1 were gasping for breath. @CAPS1 was devastated by her mistaking her for turning red. Our hearts out to poor @CAPS1 Feeling sad, but we couldn't help laughing because it was so funny. She knew it was funny, but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things I usually say is if you can't and don't want to laugh at yourself, then you There's no fun. That's why I think laughing is so important because you have to learn how to have fun when you're in you made a stupid little mistake that you think everyone in the world saw and all you need is a laugh. But you are not too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a small mistake Mistakes. Sometimes your job is to walk up to them and pat them on the back and tell them everyone makes mistakes and you have to learn how to be stupid in
A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I once heard that "laughter is the best medicine". I believe this is true. I can laugh all day and find anything @CAPS9 interesting in the @CAPS3 world. Laughter is important to me, without it life would be boring. It's good to laugh sometimes @CAPS9 from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS9 means. I like to avoid cruel @CAPS9 mean laughter, @CAPS9 just stick to good laughter. When a friend of mine is smiling @CAPS9 it makes me wonder if they are smiling @CAPS10 so I can laugh too. Birthdays are fun, and laughter is usually accompanied by fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2 and I decided to throw a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special, so I invited my closest friend, @CAPS9 my cousin. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS9 I'm very close, she was born nine months after me, so we were the same age for a while. We always had a good time and we both acted like crazy @CAPS9 always laughing. For my party, my mom made rainbow ice cream punch and it was delicious. Everyone had a great time, the @CAPS9 party was over quickly, however, my cousins didn't leave until the next day, so we continued the party. I played harder in the kitchen and my cousin came in @CAPS9 wanting more too. I poured a glass for both of us. "@CAPS3 is great!" my cousin @PERSON1 said. "I know that's what makes my mom successful" "@CAPS4, do you want a joke?" "@CAPS5." @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS6, @CAPS7 used to be a kid called itchy ass, he was really sick @CAPS9 died one day and his mom was crying to see the doctor," @CAPS8 my poor itchy ass! ""@CAPS9 @CAPS12, @CAPS4 Do you want to know what the doctor @CAPS10 said? ""@CAPS10? "@CAPS11 @PERSON1. "@CAPS12 Tickle! "@PERSON1 just had a punch and I said @CAPS3. She laughed and spat the punch out of her mouth and it made me shiver. Usually when someone spit on you or spilled something, you would Angry. I started laughing, @CAPS9 so did she. "@CAPS8 OMG! too disgusting. "@NUM1 @CAPS9 I can't help but laugh. The joke is not that funny, it's a punch in my @CAPS9 kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before realizing our moms were all standing in the kitchen. They just stare at us wondering what's going on in the world @CAPS10. You'd think being spit in your face on your @CAPS2 would drive you crazy. @CAPS3 That's why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case laughter is the shortest distance between @PERSON1 @CAPS9 I. She has to be short to get so many hits on me. Laughter makes @CAPS3 @CAPS2 extra special because I will never forget my twelfth @CAPS2.
@CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10 , @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1 and now even @CAPS2 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5). laughter! Some say it's the best median. It can brighten cloudy days, heal depression, and even heal broken hearts. On the other hand, a simple pendant or a soft smirk might break your heart! I have personally experienced hearing stupid screams being thrown around me, not because I told a witty joke just for siting, siting in my @NUM1 grade classroom and being my pear joke. Before I continue this story, @CAPS6 must know a few things. Not to mention that all @NUM1 graders have a common, undeniable erg to bring people down so they can improve themselves. I'm a @NUM1 grader and I've reached a point when my doctor tells me "@CAPS6 should consider a weight loss program". The news alone broke my heart, and the laughter of my classmates quickly brought tears to my eyes. I remember one specific @CAPS7, probably the worst one. I was on the bus nearing home when the @NUM4 girls I thought were my friends started laughing. Little did I know they were laughing at me, so I added my thoughts and what seemed to be @CAPS8 giggling. Suddenly they stopped and watched as I started whispering to each other, and then one of the girls blurted out in laughter @CAPS4: "@CAPS6 looks like a stranded wailing!". When she said that, the entire @CAPS5 bus group burst into spitting laughter. If the bus drops me off, I walk the same street every day. That day, it was more gloomy than ever. This is the day I decided I would never step on the bus again! It's that kind of laughter that breaks my heart, but also gives me a powerful drive to lose weight and regain my confidence. Days, weeks, months and years have passed since the day of @NUM1 grade. I'm @NUM6lbs and I'm the varsity cheerleader, proving who I am. Tables work against me in many ways. I'm no longer the one to get ridiculed for my weight, but I sometimes find myself making a joke or two without realizing it at the expense of other people. I remember the other day I was at the mall with my best friend. She spotted the overweight girl and immediately started giggling and elbowing me, trying to get my attention to her like she was a freak show. My first reaction when I saw this girl was a horrible @CAPS3 but just as I did I felt the same thing I felt when the bus full of my pears laughed at me s pain. I stopped immediately and realized the pain my laughter might have caused her. Myself, I'm a very interesting person and would do anything for @CAPS3. But when it comes to laughing at people and hurting what it's like to be there, that's where I draw the line because I know what it's like to be there, and I hope my story helps open your and other's eyes to you and others Learn about some of the harmful effects laughter can have. So go on @CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, even @CAPS2, not at the expense of others’ feelings.
Laughter is an important part of my life and I believe @CAPS1 has to have laughter in a good and healthy relationship. This is a true story about laughter and it has affected my life. Laughter is a good thing for your body, mind and soul, it lightens my mood when I'm feeling down. I'm happy to say that I have many relationships, many of them full of laughter. My mom and I have a great relationship, and almost any time we're in the same room there's laughter. My mom and I always laugh at stupid things. We laugh just to laugh, and most of the time, we don't even know what we're laughing at. She can make me laugh at the most ridiculous things. I'm also pretty sure she's the only one who can make me spit my drink on the dash because she makes a silly face. My mom isn't the only one I can have fun with. I remember a conversation I had with a good friend about the way people laugh. I told her how I noticed that people usually laugh with different vowels, like a, e, and o. I find it odd that I've only heard people laugh with these vowels, not me and you. She had the same idea as me, so we came up with the idea to laugh with the vowels I and u. Sure, people are so busy with their lives that they don't notice our weird laughter, but it's still fun. @CAPS1 never really realized how hard it was not to laugh before @CAPS1 came along. My mom and I fought hard not to laugh at my aunt's house. We both decided to do a facial cleansing mask we saw on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The mask itself is made of beaten egg whites and toilet paper. @CAPS1 Dip toilet paper in egg white and stick it to your face. @CAPS1 MUST wait at least 15 minutes or until it's completely dry before @CAPS1 can take it off, otherwise it won't work. The three of us did as instructed, but we were frustrated when we saw the end result of our efforts. We're not frustrated by looking offensive, we're frustrated by the fact that we all look like a bunch of crazy women, and we find it hard not to laugh. The scene with my mom and aunt was so hilarious I had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry. About fifteen minutes later, I came back to find my mom and aunt blowing each other's faces with the hair dryer in the bathroom. Seeing this, I couldn't take it anymore, I started laughing and crying, my mask was cracked, and all my efforts were wasted. That day was one of the funniest days of my life and we laughed so hard together that my stomach hurt. As I said before, I love to laugh, and I personally have many different forms of laughter. When I laugh so hard, I laugh out all the air in my lungs and forget to breathe. I don't know what it looks like to other people, but I must be a red-faced girl rocking back and forth. Other times I'm a bit macho lol, but if you're lucky @CAPS1 will hear me hum. What I'm trying to say is that laughter is a good thing, it has made a huge difference in my life I love to laugh and I think if I can't laugh I will die.
Laughter in my heart. For me, all it takes to get through a tough and scary day is a good @CAPS5. It gives you hope throughout the day, no matter what mood you are in, at work, school or any activity that involves a moment of "sigh". For me, I feel that way about school, but I can always count on my best friend @PERSON1. Every day she manages to say something totally off-topic, and if we had lunch, we would end up laughing to death at the top of the stairs near the science lab. When people walked by and they looked at us with weird eyes, we didn't care because we knew each other. For me @CAPS9 is my stress reliever. My @CAPS1 agrees with me, her name is @CAPS2 and I call her @ORGANIZATION1. We have been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspired me to do something in my life instead of working in some fast food restaurant. I played with her often at her house and we shared so many wonderful and fun memories. It really sucks when we're around each other, like one looks at each other and rumbles! , I was not breathing on the floor because I was dying laughing. I don't know what that was, but, when we met, it was like all the good times we'd spent together had flown by. Sometimes we @CAPS5 do nothing hysterically. I can't make sense, but I guess it doesn't matter when you're with your best friend. Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. It shows me how funny a person is and if he has a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile, not some opinionated guy trying to be the perfect robot. I talk to @PERSON1 about boys and boys and it makes me @CAPS5 and giggle but when we are in our 5th forestry and fire class we are like caged monkeys in a zoo Same. As if we were magically "excited," there was a sudden burst of energy. We sat next to each other and we tickled each other, @CAPS5 was really loud. By the end of the class, I made a paper ball and we played paper football, which was a lot of fun, especially when the teacher gave you dirty looks and told you to stop and you didn't. It can be said that her face turned a very bright red. Nothing compares to my level of @CAPS5 when I'm with @ORGANIZATION1. When I used to go to @CAPS3, I took three classes with her @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4. We also had lunch together, but anyway, as I said, I swear we have a non-stop @CAPS9 war every day. My @CAPS5 is more of a giggles mixed with giggles. Some people like it, some people think it's cute, some people think my @CAPS5 is funny (weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2 she would stand next to me and look at me with weird eyes or say something inaccurate or sing obnoxious and anything she does annoys me when she's around , she's distracting, but fun. I swear I got all my workouts from @CAPS9 with her. At home, when my family is all together, the laughter is mostly teasing each other. It's not the same as laughing with your friends. We made fun of my sister @CAPS6 for being a boy because everyone thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mother's womb. We made fun of my brother being the only boy of five. We make fun of my sister @PERSON2 being the shortest in our family. I can feel the difference between the laughter. This is mostly criticism. I @CAPS5 mostly because I feel more energized and it gives me something to live with every day instead of "@CAPS7 is awesome, another day to try, @CAPS8... no." @CAPS9 for me Saying that keeps me motivated through the day is like getting through life on my meds. It allows me to communicate with others easily. I thank @CAPS10 for empowering us @CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. "This is how I make friends at @CAPS5."
@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 The beautiful flame dances so peacefully in the air of @CAPS1. The gleam of fire is the only light we have. I felt someone or something watching me behind my back as I stared at the massive destruction of the warm, humid air. As I walked from one side of the house to the other, the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy. Finally, I got to the trailer and my best friend mom @PERSON4 told me she didn't think we needed that much wood. It's going to be a long weekend, I thought. About two hours after packing our clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows and tent, we set off for @ORGANIZATION1. It will be about a two hour drive and it feels like twenty minutes. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I are the worst bunch of people in a car. We all yelled and fought each other just for fun. When we reached our destination, we jumped out of the car like a swarm of angry bees. I pit @PERSON2 against @ORGANIZATION1. The second we finished packing our bags. We spent the other day basking in the 100-degree heat, swimming, and flirting with random girls we found around camp. The less we sleep the better so we can enjoy the friendship and pure fun we have. The next day, we decided to go mountain biking. We rode the bike for a few hours before we noticed the sun was going down. The moment we turned around, we saw the most luxurious view the earth has ever created. There is a burst of orange and red. Color jumps from cloud to cloud. After a few hours of biking in the heat, we opted to go for a swim. When we were swimming, I felt something touch my foot. Then suddenly there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was just a stick. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the roots of a fallen tree. It looks fake, as if someone or something was there. Still, this sparked a conversation about the day ahead for @CAPS2. Sparks dance together as if they were @CAPS4 and @LOCATION1. Our only light is firelight. @PERSON3 plays great melody on his guitar. As I listen and enjoy the perfection of nature, I feel someone watching me behind my back. I nudge @PERSON3 and our hearts stop when we turn around. There was a swirling green light nearly twenty feet in the air. I said the word everyone dreads, @CAPS2. I stood up slowly and the light started to spin faster. I quickly grabbed the machete next to me and approached the light. As I got closer, I could make out the small numbers in @CAPS1's shadow. Immediately afterwards, there was a burst of laughter from the direction of the light. A little boy appeared, laughed uncontrollably, and ran away. Back in my seat by the campfire, I started thinking about life. What if @CAPS2 was real and they were watching us. No, not real. I laughed it off and continued my week off.
What makes you laugh? Laughter is a great way to reduce stress. There are many different types of laughter in the world, some people have really high laughter while others @MONTH1 have low laughter. Others snored and made other animal noises. I know for me that I have many different types of laughter for all the different emotions I feel. I have a very unique laugh when I'm upset. Although when I'm upset, I laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day. Once, during a basketball game, I had a very relaxing evening. I fouled both left and right. Usually, when this happens to me, I get very angry, I lose my mind, and I end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench. I absolutely hate sitting on the bench. This time, I was called for a foul after already being threatened with ejection from the previous game for the same reason. I decided to smile and laugh at the foul and told myself to get rid of it. My coach was very happy with the change in my attitude, just told me to defend with my feet, get rid of bad calls and keep my head up. When you're angry, a person can stay away from the exemplary expressions you can make, although their responses will be very different if you're just smiling and laughing. I'm not the only one on my basketball team who feels that way. Many of us just laugh at incoming calls and throw them away. I am also a cheerleader. When you're a cheerleader, you should always try to keep smiling and look good. I go to a basketball game every night before I go out and cheer up. I have to do my best to stay calm during the game so that I can be in a good mood when I cheer after the game. Laughter helps me stay calm and relaxed when I play, so I'm in a good mood and can cheer. My coaches also place a lot of value on people who have a positive attitude. She taught us in practice that if we just smile and laugh about something that goes wrong, the result will be much better than when I embraced this very strongly and it stayed with me. My coach gave me a better attitude and I tried to stay positive from that day. When things go wrong in my life, I just smile and laugh to stay positive. Laughter can go a long way. I personally think that laughter helps express your mood. Laughter is also good for the body. When you're feeling down, laughing can make you feel a hundred times better. I try my best to stay in a good mood all the time. I really don't like being in a bad mood, it's really not fun. Laughing makes me feel better. I think laughter is a very good function for the body. I feel that when I laugh, my mood is better and the mood of the people around me is much better. Laughter is a magical feeling that goes through your body and makes you feel warm inside. I think everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will make your day better.
Laughter is the so-called "best medicine". I don't believe this is true, but my nephew @MONTH1 has other ideas. My nephew was "sick" every school day for two weeks. "@CAPS1 just doesn't like school", I would tell his grandma. For my nephew, the idea of school not being fun and not liking it has changed dramatically. We made him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. If they work hard they throw a party every two weeks, luckily @CAPS2 they've been working hard. My nephew's stubborn side showed an ugly face that morning as @CAPS1 fought every move we made. As we walked through that narrow door, @PERSON1 did something unusual to him and the whole of @LOCATION1's five year olds. @CAPS1 stands still like a marble statue. Couldn't be better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats and bags, and they went all out for their first game of the year. The aroma makes my stomach growl with lust. Best of all, they have desserts, cakes, cookies, pies, all cooked 30 feet away from you. So you walk in that door, and your mouth fills with warm saliva immediately. These kids play with ninja-like abilities, and for a split second in front of you, you blink, and in the blink of an eye they're gone. It took me at least an hour to find @PERSON1 in that little room. As I've realized, it's easier for them to find you by sitting down. @PERSON1 was right in front of me when my ass hit a cold, hard and almost unbearable surface. The smile on @CAPS1's face scares me, @CAPS1 has never put that big of a smile on his face unless @CAPS1 has a plan. @CAPS1 There must have been a plan and my face was soaking wet in seconds. @CAPS1 has been hiding a water pistol behind his back and has an escape route planned. Chairs and low tables, how they sit with long legs and weave them don't go together well. It was very difficult to catch up in the room, but once we got to the hallway and I could stretch my legs, it was easy to run. His smile disappeared as soon as I caught him, but not the laughter from either side. @CAPS1 @MONTH1 has my face, but I have his head! My nephew loves school now. His first year is almost over and they are still raving, but thanks to us there are no more water guns. I think if we wait any longer, it will take more work to get him to enjoy school. @PERSON1 is a very smart, athletic and nice kid. @CAPS1 would be great at school, plus @CAPS1 is strong, so I feel sorry for the kid who fought him.
I know you guys hear the same things over and over, but I also know a lot of people who don't really answer the tips you give them. Well, I'm sorry because I can't answer the prompt either. I can't remember the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 in a few years, so I'll tell you why laughing is special to me. What's so special about laughter? For me, laughter helps us in many ways. I'll talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughter is different, and even let's @CAPS3 say it to them. And why laughter is so special to me. After laughing, I always have a strange feeling in my head. I think it's because endorphins are getting into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works my abs. I also think it helps with all three aspects of the health triangle. My social life allows me @CAPS3 to connect with people. Emotional laughter makes me happy. The body is also always fun when you work out with friends. I think everyone's @CAPS3 is unique. I also know that sometimes it's funny to hear other people chuckle, sneeze, or sound like a mouse. Our laughter is another thing that keeps us, us! Laughing is special to me because of all the people who made me @CAPS3. My friends are the family I choose for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 happy every day. It's special to me because those people are special to Laughing with my dad is nothing compared to laughing with my mom and me. Laughing with my friends is never as good as laughing with my significant other. My life is full of laughter, which is special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. This is something else entirely. There's nothing more fun than having a girls night out and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is life's problem. So @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3.
In many relationships, laughter has been a cold but steady and powerful force for me. I believe laughter helps get to know someone you just met and get closer to someone you care about. In my opinion, @CAPS2 brings people closer and can turn a bad situation upside down. Gaining enough courage to make new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her is where laughter plays a big role. @CAPS2 is @DATE1, I am 15 years old and in second grade at @ORGANIZATION1 school. @CAPS2 was my first year there. I've been to a lot of schools, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wood, etc, and like any new school, I have a hard time connecting with my peers on a social level. Every day I wake up, get ready, go to school, go home and do my homework (maybe), and go to bed. @CAPS2 is a boring loop and I seem to be stuck. The image of being calm and trying to fit in doesn't seem to work that well. Because one of the things I've realized is that it's cool to try to be cool, and what you have doesn't just get you there. One of the things kids, people in general, like is when you are authentic and who you are. I found this out later, but I didn't actually realize it was people's favorite. At one point I said to myself, I don't like to act like someone or something because the truth is I actually think I'm a cool person deep down. So I changed my approach to not trying to be cool, but to be like myself. @CAPS2 Turns out I'm really cool and girls really find me attractive, not only attractive but also a fun person and likeable. Besides my looks, my main attribute is my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @CAPS2 has made me meet a lot of friends that I didn't have in the first place. @CAPS2 even made me one of the most beautiful girls I've ever met. Her name is @LOCATION2 and in my eyes no girl can compare to her. She has the body of a Coca-Cola bottle, caramel skin and the face of a goddess (I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl, she has many followers and admirers similar to mine. So what are my chances? What do I, @PERSON1 have to offer her? laughter. My max attribute has saved me many times. Although @CAPS2 didn't last as long as I hoped @CAPS2 (forever. @CAPS2 is all about making her laugh and putting a smile on her face. I believe the world wouldn't be the place without laughter @CAPS2 What CAPS2 looks like today. Sure, there is still crime and a lot of horror and atrocity today, but imagine how horrible @CAPS2 would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the heart of laughter, let's forgive and forget. @CAPS2 Allow us to turn our heads and ignore things. How can we expect to survive in the future without us being able to laugh
Laughter @MONTH1 is the best part of life. It usually expresses feelings of happiness and joy. The look seems contagious in a way, and the laughter that accompanies a smile can greatly improve someone's day. Probably the best part about laughing is that it's not hard to come by, and there's a lot to laugh about in our world. I personally find myself laughing the most when I'm with people I like to get along with. Some people believe that the key to happiness @MONTH1 is love or joy, or maybe being satisfied with yourself. I think the key is to be with the people you love and care about because everything is better when they are around. They are comparable to sunlight, and everything is better in its presence. My favorite memory involving excessive laughter occurred on a warm @DATE1 day at my friend's house just outside city limits. It must be around @NUM1 in @TIME1. The air at @DATE1 is warm, but not very hot. It seemed like a perfect afternoon. I went out with my friends, played football, made a fire and had a lot of fun. We have all the components you need to have the best night of your life. What I remember most is when we were catching the ball, I gave my friend a deep pass and as he was running under the ball he hit the fence. He got up with a smile, and the laughter spread. You could say it set the tone for the rest of the evening. The rest of @TIME1 seems like it could be taken straight from the movie. Everything went well and we all felt good. This is the essence of happiness. Laughter was everywhere, and all of us had smiles on our faces. This is my best laugh for me.
Laughter is the essence of life. Without laughter, my life would be meaningless, and without that sense of happiness or compassion, life would not be worth living. My sister is the only person I trust my secrets. When I'm down, she's the only one who makes me happy. My sister and I, laughing at each other over our own jokes. My sister is my other half and we share everything. She made me laugh and was always there when I needed her. I will always be by her side. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2, my sister and I were laughing and playing. One day, I got off the bus from school and all I could do was cry. When my sister's car came, tears fell like river water. The bus appeared, and a feeling of joy followed. @CAPS1, it's not the bus that brings me joy. It was my sister who immediately felt my pain and noticed my tears. I saw love and care in her face. She asked me what was wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My tears stopped and I started talking. I can tell her everything without trying or hiding anything. The words flowed out of my mouth. @CAPS1 Need to think about what to say. I didn't hesitate to tell her what happened. Afterwards, she told me something I will never forget. She said, "@CAPS1 I will always love you no matter what happens." @CAPS2 We laughed. That was the sweetest laughter. The air was full of laughter. None of what people said about me was true, so I learned to laugh at it.
The night was dark and cloudy, making the environment around me gloomy. Shadows slide across the street under the lights of passing vehicles and pedestrians. My day has been frustrating and it seems like karma is coming for me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. The rest of my night only got worse. Earlier that day, I made my girlfriend angry with things I shouldn't have said. She ended up calling me as soon as she sat on the bed. The words we exchanged leave a smoldering wreck behind us. Our conversation ended in anger and a disconnect from the phone. Once I got back into bed, my anger subsided and I started to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt. I said some unnecessary and terrible things. As I lay in bed, my heart seemed to be squeezed and slowed down by some invisible force. It made it hard for me to breathe and soon tears fell from my eyes. Guilt and anguish ran through my soul like a burglar sneaking into a dark house and stealing whatever valuables I left behind. My day ends in tears and pain. But then my phone rang again. I quickly wiped the tears from my face and continued to read the caller ID, it turned out I was my best friend, so I answered without knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to go out and have a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirits, even if it was only half an inch. I was there waiting for @CAPS1 when he pulled into my driveway. I climbed into the passenger seat and @CAPS1 knew immediately that something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something happened and I replied "@PERSON1". @CAPS1 Knowing now is not the right time to talk about it, so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee, and I started ripping apart the sugar packets and pouring them into my steaming coffee mug. @CAPS1 does the same thing, but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk. I looked up from the confusion around the coffee mug and nodded slowly. I started to recount everything that happened in my day in quick succession. Brings a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice softened and my fists loosened. We sat in silence for a while, @CAPS1 carefully choosing his words. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for a while because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how my mother was and another storm of curses poured out of my mouth. We fell silent again, and @CAPS1 asked me, "@CAPS2, are you feeling better now?" I looked at him puzzled because that wasn't the answer I expected. After thinking about it, I answered yes. Then we had dinner, paid and left. My mood has improved, but I'm still depressed. So we drove to the river and got out of his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked to the bank and stood staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked me if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke that @CAPS1 told me probably shouldn't be repeated, but it made me laugh so hard it was hard to breathe. His timing was impeccable and it got my spirits high. When I'm feeling down, I always turn to my friends. And have been there to prove that I can count on them. It was a disaster that day, but the rest of the night was much better than I had hoped. Not only does my friends lift my mood, but it's also important to make me laugh. Because if you're counting on someone to brighten your day, @CAPS2 what better way to make them laugh. Laughter has always been important in my life. I am smiling every day. Mainly because I find the stupidest things hilarious. I know the laughter will never go away. I hope one day I'm old, and when I'm old, all my wrinkles come from the countless times I'm laughing with my friends. Because laughter is magical. It can make sad people happy, brighten the sun on overcast days and brighten the darkest situations.
Being around people who always make you feel comfortable and be around you is probably the best quality of a friend. Everyone has flaws; friends can always bypass them and find good in someone they trust. A friend can tell a joke that will make you cry. It always helps to make them laugh when they think their life couldn't get any worse. Laughter is the most valuable gift that can be given. You know they're happy just by seeing the smiles on their faces. There have been many times in my life that I laughed so hard that I cried. There really is nothing in the world like knowing that there are people in your life who can cheer you up, just by doing or even saying something ridiculous to make you laugh hysterically. I've been laughing all day. If I don't, people will be suspicious, and they think there's something wrong with me. This is what laughter does in my life. Laughter is a second language in my life. So far in my life there has been one time in particular that made me laugh so hard that I cried so hard. My friends live at my house @TIME1 and we are just boys. We do a lot of things that make us question our sanity: we fill our spoons with hot sauce, we watch comedy shows, we eat ourselves sick too. It was the most important time of our lives and we all laughed. We can't breathe while watching a comedy show. We laughed so hard! Nothing stops me from laughing; I keep replaying every joke in my head, and then I laugh more. I'm already in pain, like when we watched it before. The comedian is a talking magician; the way he puts them together, it's as if he's reading an ancient holy book. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did it for ten minutes straight! This is incredible. Creating these lifelong memories with friends is something I will never forget. I really know how good my life is; people will kill my shoes and get love and support from my friends and family. All of my experiences are things that I have learned from them, whether they are good or bad, and I know that all of them will help me make good decisions later in life. All the laughs I share with other people let me know they are having a good day because they laugh with me. They are also very important in my day. It's also good to be myself around them because I know they've accepted me into their lives and I don't have to try to be someone else. No matter how much they deny it, everyone laughs at some point in their life. I don't even know why they do, because what's better than a little giggle every now and then? I really don't think there is. I am so honored to have such wonderful people in my life who are always exciting, full of laughter and life. In my personal opinion, it shouldn't be any other way. Fulfill your life; why would you want to live it any other way?
It's always hard to know what to do when friends or family come to you when they're sad or angry. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke always makes them feel better. As I was sitting at home on a sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friend @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear, all I could hear was a loud cry. @PERSON1 didn't say anything to me, not a word. Even so, I kept asking her what was wrong, and @PERSON1 didn't say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her, I told her to calm down and take a deep breath. Desperately, I hope she can talk to me and tell me what's going on, because I'm already starting to get really worried. After a few minutes, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what was going on. @PERSON1 told me in the beginning that it was irresponsible for her not to pay attention to what was going on around her. I asked her why she said that because I know she is a responsible person. In the end, @PERSON1 screamed that her dog @CAPS2 was knocked over while she was at home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball. The dog is actually dead. I find it very funny and pathetic that @PERSON1 would cry over her dog. I don't want to be rude about it and tell her what happened. Even thought that was how I felt about the whole situation. I figured out what I need to say to @PERSON1, but I'm confused. Actually, I am not confused, I am afraid that my words will hurt her feelings. In the end, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dogs, my friend has a few dogs for sale. Plus, I told @PERSON1 I'd buy her a new puppy if it made her feel better. After speaking to her, the scene fell into an awkward silence. My hands are shaking because I think @PERSON1 is crazy. All of a sudden I just heard her start laughing and again she was speechless. I made her laugh, I didn't cry, I didn't get mad at me, and I felt so relieved. @PERSON1 won't shut up, she's just laughing and laughing hysterically. Finally, she closed her mouth and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 Thanks for making her laugh and make a joke. Instead of saying things that make her sad and make her cry more. I'm glad I made her laugh because she feels better about herself, not the worst. When I laugh, I tell her that I am the one she needs to be called to whenever she needs to laugh. Anytime, any day, anywhere, I'd love to put a smile on her face and a loud laugh from her mouth. Laugh with me @PERSON1 and thank me again for making her laugh. From that day on, I always liked to make people laugh because I knew I would make them feel better. I certainly like other people to make me laugh too. It's just a wonderful feeling, a wonderful feeling that everyone loves but can't really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh, I found that laughter is a key element of life.
Laughter is an important element in life. Because there is no happiness or joy in the world without @CAPS3. @CAPS1 is a good joke, @CAPS1 is who you want to be. Some people use laughter to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS10 dad gets hurt, he starts laughing. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 was in the Navy a few years ago. During training, he was hit in the abdomen. No problem, but @CAPS3 did hurt him. So @CAPS10 @CAPS2 sat down and started laughing. I'm guessing this so-called trait is hereditary, as I find myself doing the same thing all the time. @CAPS3 not long ago when I learned how laughter heals. @CAPS3 is the last @DATE3, @CAPS3 is earlier than @DATE5 and @CAPS5 is close to @DATE5. Traditionally, @CAPS10's parents and I would drive to @ORGANIZATION1. Buy a big pack of fireworks with the money we've saved up all year round. I was so happy when @CAPS5 of @DATE5 arrived, I woke up and immediately ran up to @CAPS10 mom and asked "@CAPS5 of @DATE5 of @CAPS3, can I pack the fireworks now? " A new puppy found its first chew toy. @CAPS7 shook his head "@CAPS6 or @PERSON1, it's only 11am. Sunset doesn't come until 7 or 8" @CAPS7 smiled at me. "@CAPS8 girl." @CAPS7 whispered as @CAPS7 left the room. Once the huge golden sun finally set, smaller bright twinkling stars appeared. We all know it's time for @CAPS3. "@CAPS9 Do you like doing honors?" @CAPS10 Dad handed me my first firework and a lighter. A big smile on @CAPS10's face without @CAPS10's control. I love fireworks, I love bright colors and watching them shoot up into the new bright sky fills @CAPS3 with colorful sparks. After @CAPS5 on @DATE5 ended, @CAPS10 cousin @CAPS12 came over. @CAPS10 Mom is sick but @CAPS3 is not contagious. @CAPS10 @CAPS25 thinks we are old enough to take care of ourselves and @CAPS10 mom. @DATE3 is coming to an end and I would love to see a movie @CAPS13 with @CAPS10 mom and @CAPS12. @CAPS10 Mom has a lot of problems and her doctor put her on several medications to ease her problems. But @CAPS3 seems like @CAPS7 is getting a new drug from the doctor every week, as the symptoms of each drug cause more and more problems. Between @DATE5, @DATE4, @CAPS10 mom still isn't showing any signs of getting better. @CAPS12 and I take the dog for a walk in the nearby park, we go swimming, watch @CAPS15, clean the car, we'll try to find something we can actually do. Here comes @DATE1, @CAPS10 mom showing signs of improvement @CAPS7 walking more naturally. I called my dad @CAPS10 and asked him if he thought going to the movies would be a good idea. He said to wait another day. I'm worried about having to wait another day because @CAPS12 is going home the next day. The next day I was woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS10 mom. "@LOCATION1, @PERSON1 dear wake up" @CAPS7 shakes @CAPS10's shoulder. I slowly opened @CAPS10's eyes and opened wider as @CAPS10's eyes focused on the things around me. "@CAPS18 going to the movies?" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10's shoulder again. "@CAPS19, but you're sick." I sighed heavily. "I feel better today." @CAPS7 laughed. "@CAPS21 because the next show is in 20 minutes." A sudden rush to @CAPS21 woke me up. Then I woke up @CAPS12 and we left soon after. This movie is good. After that, @CAPS12 got home and everything was quiet again, the room was empty, the sun was gone, and the whole house was still. @date2. This day is usually a time for rest. I'm on the @CAPS10 computer most of the time, @CAPS10 dad is playing his video game. @CAPS10 Mom is preparing dinner in the kitchen. @CAPS10 Dad went in and helped her eat. Until @CAPS7 nearly fell with a few pans in his hands. @CAPS10 Dad suggested @CAPS7 to take a nap or at least lie down. Later that night, @CAPS10 dad found @CAPS10 mom. Lying stiff, cold...@CAPS10 Mother died in her sleep that day. I think @CAPS10's heart exploded like fireworks. A few days passed and I stood motionless on the sofa. I found solace in texting @CAPS12. Tell her what the doctor told us. @CAPS12 mentioned @CAPS10 @CAPS25 about @CAPS10 mom. Despite @CAPS12's broken heart, she and her @CAPS2 @PERSON2 are trying to make @CAPS10 @CAPS25 and everyone laugh. Because they know that laughter will take away some of the pain. I think it's great that they find a little laugh in a dark place. That's why laughter is an important element of outdoor living.
Someone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". @CAPS1, to me that means, since everyone is smiling, laughing is the quickest or easiest way to connect with another person. I believe it was because I didn't get along with my brother for a while. We are almost never around each other and when we are together we either fight or ignore each other. It wasn't a big deal because he was five years older than him. But once I got older, my brother and I started seeing each other often. So we decided to sit down one day and talk. We're not sure what to say. So for the first ten minutes, we just sat there quietly. Only two people on the back porch in the middle of @TIME1. Then he suddenly fell into the bushes. We both laughed harder than we've ever laughed. So @CAPS1, when my family gets together, there aren't a lot of arguments or fights, we all sit down and tell stories and laugh. For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important parts of a relationship because laughter brings happiness, and happiness brings love; and love is the most important part of life. So I said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between all people."
This true story might sound cheesy, but it's true, and it's a love story in my opinion. However, I will substitute other names for my real names. On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log into the @CAPS1-book to chat with some of the new friends she made online @PERSON1 forgot she sent @PERSON2 a friend request. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 accepted @PERSON1's request, and @PERSON1 remembered the request at this point. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are staring at each other minute after minute getting to know each other, @CAPS9 had no idea who the other was before. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after the chat, and @CAPS12 she can call or text him while away from @CAPS1-book to stay in touch. @PERSON2 is starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knows that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. He is @NUM1 and also has mutual friends. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 really enjoyed talking to @PERSON2. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 laughs a lot. I mean "a lot", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 loves it because it always makes her happy. @PERSON2 knows that @PERSON1 recently broke up with her boyfriend. Anyway, @PERSON2 doesn't mind, he @CAPS4 loves @PERSON1. He has high hopes for @CAPS4 for the chance to make @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12...he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepts to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt, she said..."@CAPS3 I would love to be your girlfriend". "@CAPS4 would you?" @CAPS5 @PERSON2. "@CAPS3 why don't I? Reply to @PERSON1. "@CAPS6 I thought you wouldn't @CAPS9, you recently got out of a relationship" @PERSON2 replied. Gone are the days and they've been doing great until.. .... @PERSON1 started getting texts from her ex. This started affecting @PERSON1's relationship with @PERSON2. But the bad thing is that @PERSON1 still loves @PERSON3. @PERSON2 knows that. But it didn't stop @PERSON2 fighting for @CAPS7 for @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is the kind of girl who doesn't like to hide anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS12 One night when @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 were on the phone, @PERSON2 decided to ask @PERSON1 if she Willing to try and forget about her ex. @PERSON1 is afraid to answer the question, but she has to be honest..."@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try, but I won't promise anything. "@CAPS9 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 have good communication when it comes to laughing @CAPS4, @PERSON1 changed the subject, @CAPS5 @PERSON2 if he was willing to do her a favor. Of course @PERSON2 said "@CAPS3". @PERSON1 has The good thing about @CAPS5 @PERSON2 is if he can laugh for her. "@CAPS11! " @PERSON2 laughed. "@CAPS12 Can you do me a favor?" @PERSON1 @CAPS5. "@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughing again. Who would have thought laughter in love would make @CAPS12 better. @CAPS3 It won't make it perfect or exactly what you want, but it sure does Much better than fighting @NUM2 over simple stupid and pointless things. I believe laughter plays an important role in any relationship. As if laughter is a language we can all understand, Can communicate with each other. @CAPS6 I hope you enjoy my true story of how laughter plays an important role in all relationships.
My relationship with laughter. Well, the first time I faced laughter was when I first met my boyfriend. Before I met him, I was depressed and my friends couldn't take it. But I fell in love for the first time when my friend introduced me to him, and I used to be happy, not depressed, crying all the time in the corner alone. I laughed when that was the first time in almost a year, and I didn't smile until the day I met him. That's when my friends knew I had found someone who could take care of me and love me. Later in the relationship, laughter comes into play. When I'm around him, I'm laughing all the time instead of being upset all the time. That's when we started hanging out, but, all our friends came to hang out with us. After we said we were going to hang out, we got to know each other better than when we first met. We didn't start dating until our freshman year. That's when I found out that I thought I could date someone other than him, and I didn't believe it at first until the guy walked up to me and started yelling. He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friend saying "@CAPS1 is @CAPS3 cheating on me? It's over?" with someone I just met @CAPS3. Then he tried to tell me it was over and I told him "We haven't dated since the beginning!". My friends came up to me , saw me in tears and asked me what was wrong, and tried to find me someone new. By the time @CAPS4 I'm with another guy, I'm happy with him, nothing can change he will always be by my side no matter what happens between us. He was the best thing that ever happened to me, he made me laugh when I was angry or pissed off, he said "don't worry it'll be alright, I promise, so trust me." Laughter in this relationship It's been almost a year, so we're not going to change that unless one of us screwed up again, and we've screwed up so many times that we don't know what to do. If it leaves now, I don't know what I'm going to do, it's going to be a part of my life, now let's see if we can keep it together and not screw it up this time. This part of my relationship is the best, at least it won't change, I hope it doesn't because it's taking me back to my life of being afraid of my stepdad, and I'm glad I found someone. I hope it doesn't change because the laughter comes with him and when I'm around him he makes me laugh and when I cry no one can make me laugh not even my friends and family No exception. The laughter is here almost all the time now and I can't wait for the day when the sadness disappears. So now I'm very happy with him and hope there's nothing bad between us because we love each other and when he's not around I'm not my lively self. Six of my friends said to @CAPS2 "@CAPS3 is losing your vivacious self, don't let her disappear on @CAPS3, she will guide @CAPS3 on the way." @CAPS4 also told my dad I'm no longer with them Hang out, @CAPS1 I don't because @CAPS4 can be bossy, @CAPS4 tells me what I can and can't do. @CAPS1 can't make people understand that this relationship won't work if @CAPS4 is stuck in the middle of it my relationship with laugh is not about my friends and family, it's about my boyfriend and me, that's @CAPS1 me Tell @CAPS3 about my relationship with laughs. Suffice to say that my relationship with laughter will always be there and nothing will change it, not even my parents or his parents, we can all promise @CAPS3 that much. @CAPS1 Can't this relationship have a happy ending without anyone or anything trying to intervene? I just wish there was a world @CAPS3 could escape to where no one knew where in the world it was. Well, nothing will make this relationship go bad unless we start fighting each other again, I hope nothing will separate us, and if it does happen, who knows what will happen.
"laugh" I once heard a man say "laughing is the key to happiness, not laughing is not healthy" @CAPS1 Do people like to laugh? Because laughing creates fond memories, it eliminates sadness, it gives you energy, and it can even give you a great ab workout depending on how much and for how long you laugh. There's nothing like a funny movie that will make you laugh so hard, your jaw hurts, and your stomach hurts worse the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny. I bet laughing or making people laugh can get you a job. Let's say you're in an interview for a job that involves dealing with people every day. Are you going to be boring and trendy there? No, you go in and make the person interviewing you laugh and act like you've known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways like making fun of people because it's funny @MONTH1. Call your kids by your gym class name because they can't throw a baseball at you. Laughing @MONTH1 feels as bright as the stars in the night or @MONTH1 feels as bad as a basketball player misses the buzzer to win a championship game. Be careful when using it, think of it as a loaded gun, as it can injure someone if used incorrectly. Hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I started talking about all the wonderful memories we had with her when she was with us. I noticed tears rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1 cheeks. Then we suddenly started talking about how she would go crazy and swear when my dad was a little boy, and then get embarrassed because she knew she was never supposed to say the lord's name in vain. Thinking back to those moments, we started laughing, not just a small little laugh, I mean we laughed out loud. Then, it got rid of that painful grief that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how that night's laughter became such an emotional memory of old age.
Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. My life wouldn't be as exciting as it is without laughter. There are many people in my life who have made laughter the best way to brighten my day, such as my friends, family and boyfriends. I have many stories and laughter is a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better instead of thinking about my stomach pain. This all happened on @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 on my way home from my boyfriend's house. We sat on the Max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me it was probably because I wasn't eating anything. I'm worried because it's going to be a long journey home. On our way to my house, my boyfriend tried to distract me so I wouldn't worry too much about my stomachache. He started talking to me, telling me how my school days were going, and I told him my days were okay, not bad. We started chatting for a while until my boyfriend took off his hat and said "Flat to volume!" @CAPS1 My boyfriend took off his hat and said I laughed out loud! I laughed so hard not because I had a stomachache all day without eating, but because of how hard and painful I was laughing. I laughed so hard because my boyfriend's hair was all messed up. His hair looks so funny! When I try not to laugh, I ask my boyfriend why his hair is like this? He started telling me @CAPS1 he was in the shower and he grabbed a shampoo bottle that said flat to curly, he didn't know his hair would have so many curls. I couldn't stop laughing at my boyfriend's hair the whole way home. I thought it was so funny that I forgot about my stomach ache. To this day, I still laugh at my boyfriend's hair and how it looked that day. We have an inside joke now, and every time I remember that day I told him "from flat to volume," we started laughing. Now I know laughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomachache. No matter what, laughter will always be a part of me and my life!
Have you ever wondered how you and your best friend became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and don't remember. So the story I'm going to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'll also tell you how we've always been friends and all the little things that keep us friends. Granted, we didn't start out as friends who were laughing all the time, but as weepers and helpers. @PERSON3 and I first met in eighth grade. I just got called out of my first class and was greeted by my math teacher @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told me we just hired a new student who moved here from @LOCATION1 and is not very happy with it. She also asked me if I would mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4, and I agreed and walked into the room where @PERSON3 was. When I saw her, the first thing I noticed was her eyes, running down her face like tears. Then I realized she's a very beautiful girl, unhappy as @PERSON1 said. I admit I was a little scared to try and show her around because she wasn't happy to be here at all. But once we started, she calmed down a lot, but she still wouldn't laugh at our faint temptation to joke around. I still think she should be happy and burst out with big guns. So I walk differently, talk in a funny voice, and I even start randomly saying funny things in long pauses. At the end she laughed, so I moved on. By the end, I made her and @PERSON4 laugh so hard we almost got ourselves wet. But as fun as it was for us, it was definitely not the last fun thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen, and anyway, you always remember it when you see the person it happened to, right? I've had a lot of those moments to say the least to @PERSON3. Of course, a lot of this happens to other people, but that's what makes it interesting. Like one time in our drawing class we @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 and I were all drawing in @PERSON2's small office. I was excited almost all day, and so was @CAPS3. I casually looked around the room and saw a very cute poster that I hadn't noticed before, and I didn't realize I was exclaiming "@CAPS2, this is really cute." @CAPS3 started laughing and grabbed the table, to avoid falling to the ground. I didn't realize I said it out loud and was really confused but still laughing because it was really fun watching them laugh. They finally calmed down and said what I just said, I blushed but started laughing. Now, every time they see me and remember that moment, they laugh out loud, they point at something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think having good memories of really interesting things keeps us together. It helps us remember the good times of bad times. It also helps keep our bonds strong in our friend base. But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends will help us later. I don't think our friendship will last long if we don't do all the fun little things and just big fun or boring things. Like when we accidentally burp when we talk or fart when we walk. Or maybe when I laugh, I cover my face with my hands and my arms shake. Probably even when we say something weird or walk for fun because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just friends that keeps us together, it's who we are now and who we are with that person, and I feel like I've become a better person, and I believe I've helped her become a person as well. Plus, the little things are just as fun as the big things we do. So, as I said before, laughter is an important part of friendship. My friendship with @PERSON3 didn't start with laughter, it started with tears and turned into laughter. Laughter brought us together in a strange way and it's been strong since then, not only because we have a lot in common, and frankly we don't even have that much in common, it's because the big we don't just share together hilarious moments and sharing with others some of the little things we do every day that we find very funny. I have to say that laughter is probably the best way to keep any relationship looking good and healthy.
There are a few things that make strangers get along with each other, and in my experience, it's laughter. It was very stressful and uncomfortable to meet my boyfriend's parents. I am alone and I can get along with anyone. It was a bit of a challenge to start a conversation with someone who was judging my every move. My boyfriend @PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year and is the type of person who loves spending time with his family. So, obviously, meeting with family comes into play. I met his parents when I was young, we went to the last years of elementary school and some junior high school together, except for a year of high school, I left for a few years and came back really different. So after dating @NUM1 months, I met these guys. One day on @DATE1, @PERSON3 was at a football game and I was at the game with some girlfriends who were also dating people from the team. After a horrible loss, @PERSON3 came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet my parents. I took a deep breath and started getting really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have any problems, but the fact that I want his parents to love me puts a lot of pressure on me. I followed him slowly and said "@CAPS3" in my friendliest voice. His mom reached out and said "@CAPS1 @PERSON1 I'm @CAPS2" and I took her hand and replied "@CAPS3 nice to meet you". I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance, then his dad gave a very welcoming smile, his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "@CAPS4 is there, I'm @PERSON2" I shook his hand, feeling less nervous and more comfortable. "@CAPS1, nice to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprised when I spoke and we started a great conversation about football. After about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes of talking about football , @PERSON3 brought up something that reminds me of a joke. I always have crappy jokes, so I'm afraid to tell his parents. It's not even a funny joke, @PERSON3 thinks it's lame, but I love it. Whatever How I still took the chance. I said "@CAPS4 reminded me of a joke" and @PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes and said oh god no. I looked away and started" so there were two loose ends in the oven Creampie, one said, wow! It's hot in here and everyone else there screams, OMG! Talking muffins. I started laughing, my laugh was weird. Anyone I've met has told me that laughter is so unique. His mom said "so cute I have to tell @CAPS6" and I smiled gratefully. His dad @PERSON2 sweetly said: "I love your laughter, I've never heard a laugh like this". @PERSON3 came in and said "yes, her laugh really matters". We all laughed and went to dinner and laughed out loud and laughed at my laughter. Thank god for the laugh, once we started laughing, I felt comfortable and welcome. To this day we laugh at me for telling that joke. To this day I am still glad I told the joke.
On @DATE1, I had a mission meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 at @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I asked @CAPS11 grandpa to pick us up from home and take us to @LOCATION2. When we get to church, I go to @CAPS11 for a meeting until @NUM2 o'clock and then to study the bible. I was tired and ready to go home. Realizing that @CAPS11 grandpa knew where to find it, he apparently left home, @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 just got there to pick us up. I've just been told there is a parent-teacher conference for students who are going on a mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON1 craft shop. When we got there, @PERSON2 and I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 while @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS3 stayed at @LOCATION3. I bought a pair of comfy slippers for me and @CAPS11 mom. Then we go back to @PERSON1 to brag about slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma. That was a bad idea, @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She has been taking it. I told her that if she stopped watching, we'd go to @CAPS6, buy a sandwich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS6, @PERSON2 was in a bad mood as he was getting ready to go home. We ordered our sandwiches and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. After searching for an hour and a half, she finally found a pair of slippers for herself. Everyone got in the car and we thought we were going home when Grandma suddenly yelled "Going to @LOCATION5's and I want a bowl of chili". Our response was "@CAPS10, @CAPS11 OMG". We couldn't make her hungry so we had to stop. After getting the chili, she said "I need to get into @ORGANIZATION1", @CAPS10 boy was a mistake. We are forever @ORGANIZATION1 in one day. After we got back into the car from @ORGANIZATION1, I was in the back seat between @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 don't forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important email he got when we got home and his response was "@CAPS10 yay! If we get home". All I can do is laugh. @PERSON2 videotaped me, @CAPS11 Mom kept looking back at me to see if I was okay. I just couldn't stop laughing. I'm laughing to the point of crying, @CAPS11's breath is gone, @CAPS11's face is as red as a cherry. I laughed so hard from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4. When I finally fell asleep.
Laughing will make you live longer. This is what I was told as a child. I think laughter is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my association with my sister @LOCATION1 we laughed all day every day. I think that's why we're happiest together. I laugh the most when I'm with my brothers. I remember one time I was with @PERSON2 and we were just laughing idly, which is what we do a lot. I am just a person who loves to laugh. Everyone knows this. I guess when I laugh it just takes away everything that's bad right now, and none of that matters. I have a friend namd @PERSON3 who is the kind of guy who makes me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. Therefore, he will always be an important person in my life. Once I was with @PERSON2 with this girl and she was very quiet for some reason with us and I told her straight up that she needed to talk, or laugh! or something else. Then she opened up and laughed at the funny thing. Look, if it's bad for you to sit there with a group of friends, or people you're related to, and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh at something you think is funny, even if other people don't laugh at it. who cares. be you. I love, absolutely love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means the baby is going to be a happy person. In movies and TV shows, sometimes I laugh. I just think if you laugh, your life will be a lot easier than just looking at negative things. Just be happy, and smile every now and then. One time my sister @PERSON2 and I stole a truck, hmmm.. we asked the guy if he could do something with his truck and he said yes, but we didn't really do anything with it.. we just thought drive. And, when we started driving, we drove so fast and had loud music. It's funny, and now every time we hear that song we're blasting we're laughing out loud. So when you make good memories and then think about those memories later in life, or they are brought up in some way...it's fun to sit there and reminisce. I can tell you a thousand stories. This is an. At one point I was staying with @PERSON2 and our good friend @PERSON1 and we pretended we were in a spaceship under his desk and it was so, so, so much fun! I will never forget that time. Even as I write this, I still laugh at these stories. I was skating downtown with my sister @PERSON2 once and I was trying to do this trick and I thought it was a three wheel flip? Anyway, I tried to do this, but I fell. It hurts, but it's also funny. Now every time we pass the spot where I fell, we laugh. Memories are fun, every memory I have, makes me laugh just thinking about it. One time I was hanging out with @PERSON2 with some cool guys and we left and went to this girl's house where we turned up the music and only danced for an hour and we had a video. That was really fun. In the video, I mostly just laugh.
@CAPS1.., that's what I like to hear, laughter. Laughter has played a big role in my life. For me, it's the only thing that keeps me going. Sometimes it's even better than ice cream, which says a lot. I have had many different experiences in my life and laughter is an important part of them. Just like @CAPS6, my brother was sent back to prison. @CAPS6 I'm @CAPS5 I have to laugh because it's the only thing that makes me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 I was dumped like last night's garbage, the laughter made me feel like nothing happened. So @CAPS6 people who aren't feeling the best in life, or are struggling, I really believe that laughter makes everything feel a little better. @CAPS2! ", it hit me in the head like a brick. It was hard to hear that my brother was sent back to prison. He just came out of a four-month sentence three months ago. One of the hardest things was Wondering what to say to @CAPS6 his three-year-old son @PERSON1, asking "@CAPS4 of @CAPS3? ". The main reason I'm not as scared of my brother as I used to be because of my nephew @PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his lovely laugh. So whenever my brother is sent back to prison, I know everything It's all going to be okay @CAPS6 I see a big smile on @PERSON1's chubby little face. He's my inspiration @CAPS6 I feel like the word has absolutely nothing to laugh at or laugh at. Even @CAPS6 we all sit In the ER, he's still laughing all the time. Being @CAPS5 is absolutely the worst thing in the world for me. I hate not being able to get up and go to places. All I usually do is hang out with friends, but @CAPS6 I Yes @CAPS5 I can't do anything. The only thing I can do is take nasty meds. I was recently admitted to the hospital with very severe abdominal pain. Not even two weeks later I was back in the ER with strep Room. I've been through it for about four weeks together. One of the things I hate more about being @CAPS5 is that people feel bad about me being @CAPS5. So whenever I'm @CAPS5, I always joke and let People laugh, no matter how bad it hurts me. Although laughing doesn't feel good physically, it does make me feel better emotionally. Laughing is like my drug brand for @CAPS6, I don't feel well. It seems Made me feel quicker than any other over-the-counter drug. Especially "breaking up" with my first love. "I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you again" was the last thing he said to me. My first love just let me Standing alone on the stairs in my own tears. This was my first real breakup. I had a hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up, my friends came to pick me up. They told me I needed to Cheer up. @CAPS6 We were in town and we stopped at the store. My friend @PERSON3 asked me to pick a half gallon of ice cream so I got mint chocolate chips. We finally got to @PERSON3's house and he told me I had to Eating a full half gallon of ice cream myself. I certainly didn't argue. While I was eating ice cream, he and my friend @PERSON2 did a skit about how they were going to be my ex. I laughed so hard, My brain freezes. By the end of the skit, I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughter made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I feel like just laughing with my friends can bring us closer When I was with my ex we never hung out because I was always with him. I had a great time that day and I'll always remember it. Laughing really is over the top The key to a good life. "@CAPS6 Life gives you lemons for lemonade" is a quote I choose to listen to and try to follow. For me it's just about enjoying the little things in life. So whenever I laugh I'm having a little bit of fun in my life. No matter how hard @MONTH1's life is, laughing is what I live part. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS5, or I'm just dumped; I'm laughing so I don't have to worry. Laughter is a major ingredient in everyone's life, don't forget it or life won't be the way anyone wants it to be. "
laughter. We all need it. We need it @CAPS8 Reminder, @CAPS7 is the hope of those who have perseverance, the hope of those who do not strive to improve others, but the hope of those who strive to improve themselves. We need it @CAPS8 to remind us to live our dreams, not dream life. And, most importantly, in my opinion, @CAPS8 reminds us that even if we @MONTH1 make mistakes, @CAPS7 is still an opportunity for those who have the courage to seize it. On @DATE1, my adoptive parents decided to go out to dinner. The children were of course not invited. We either stayed at home with the babysitter or went to a friend's house. No one wants to stay home, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 has nothing to do. One of my best friends, @PERSON2, is an only child who lives with her grandmother. I made a quick call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. @TIME1 It's about five and I won't be back later than nine. I have four hours, two weeks ahead of @CAPS1. Neither of us knew @CAPS13 could handle that much time. After all, we've only seen each other for a few hours at school. This approach is new to both of us. We are both sophomores and I am obsessed with @LOCATION1. Considering that @CAPS6 knew this information, this proved to be a big problem. @CAPS6 has no problem, but her boyfriend @PERSON1 has a problem. We get along just fine, but he doesn't like the fact that I spend so much time with her, especially when he's not @CAPS7. However, he trusted me to take care of her, so he didn't make a fuss about it. We decided to build the @CAPS1 tree first and then start with @CAPS7. We all have @CAPS3 so pretty much everything on the tree is shiny. Wire, decorations, pictures, @CAPS14 named. It took about twenty minutes to get everything ready, not counting the time to unwrap all the decorations. When we were done it looked spectacular. I'll help make some nice looking @CAPS12 trees, but this is by far the best. I am proud of our work. I don't have a lot to appreciate in my life, so it's one of those things that usually doesn't matter, but suddenly it's very important. We admired our work for a few minutes, then went downstairs to the study. @PERSON2 chatted with @PERSON1 on @CAPS4 for a while while texting my girlfriend. I am preparing to break up with her. @PERSON3 was with me most of my sophomore year and I'm starting to regret it. Our relationship started when a friend of mine @PERSON4 ended up with her friend. I know it sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I put myself between @PERSON4 and her so they don't fight anymore. Now I'm starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @CAPS6 is like a bad drug that made @CAPS14 very high and then dropped @CAPS14 like a rock. @CAPS6 is very controlling. @CAPS6 is not @CAPS12 for me, @PERSON2 finally convinces me that enough is enough. After breaking up with @PERSON3, I feel both happy and depressed. I'm glad I can be free, but I'm depressed because I feel so alone. I've never been close to people @CAPS12, so this is hard for me to do. @PERSON2 is not happy to see me being so rude. @CAPS6 knows me better than most, so @CAPS6 knows I need quick help. @CAPS6 does something very subtle that doesn't seem to matter to most people. @CAPS6 took a look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think that was what @CAPS12 was thinking. Her boyfriend is very protective of @PERSON2. He didn't like men approaching her under any circumstances. "@CAPS5 @CAPS14 Please try to relax? You're making me nervous." @CAPS6 said in that tone, which meant it was more of an order than a question. Maybe it's because I'm in a bad mood, which seems like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing so hard. "@CAPS7. It wasn't that hard, was it?" @CAPS8 @CAPS6 Pulling my arms, I kissed my forehead; the way we say "your beauty". "Will @CAPS9 @CAPS14 be okay?" @CAPS6 asked in a worried voice. "@CAPS11, I'll be fine. Thanks @PERSON2." "@CAPS12. @CAPS14 never showed me guitar stuff." "@CAPS13 guitar?" "@CAPS14 said @CAPS14 played guitar." @CAPS15 Then I realize I may never find another friend @CAPS8 @CAPS12 @CAPS8 this one. "@CAPS16 @CAPS11. Come on. I'll show @CAPS14 how to play @CAPS17 people."
As people bond over the years, those bonds are strengthened by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are important, but they all work together to make those connections. For normal people to enjoy each other, they have to have fun, and fun starts with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain, and if two people find the same thing interesting, it brings them together with similar interests. It's easier to attract people around you by telling a funny joke or being someone who always has a smile on your face. I've been a really happy kid since I was a kid and easy to get along with. I believe I am because my parents always told me, "Happy people are who people want to be." @CAPS1 By being a seemingly happy person, it gave me my friends. Although I never really understood what it meant because it could mean many different things. Whenever I was with my friends, looking back now, we were always laughing or joking. We may be laughing at ourselves, or we may be laughing at random people on the street. We can do nothing and laugh at some stupid things and still have a good time. @MONTH1 started an interesting argument for us. If someone starts saying stupid things, one of us will take the chance to make him sound as stupid as possible. Most of the time, we don't get hurt by it, but many times we take it very far. We shared all the laughs before we became friends. Stupidity and pain are probably the two biggest reasons we laugh. It would be stupid if someone said something that didn't make sense or came in at the wrong time. I've never understood why we laugh at pain, maybe because we're glad we're not in it, though sometimes it is, but maybe because we know they'll get over it. When someone is badly injured and another person laughs about it a lot, I see them get angry because they are being teased for their pain. They just need to realize that it's fun for people to get hurt and know they'll laugh at it too. Laughter always brings people into relationships. It shows common interests and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main ingredient that brings happiness to people's lives, without happiness and laughter, the world would be very boring.
Laughter is a mystery. Happen as you want @CAPS2. It puts a smile on the face. Laughter just happens in so many ways. Although, mine just happened to be in a frenzy and the mess that followed. Things got extreme and unforgettable. Something you can never forget. About two months ago, in the cold @DATE1. This is my @NUM1 birthday. I threw a small party for myself at home. However, I would like to treat myself. @CAPS2 Everyone arrived with fake smiles on their faces. No one will tell me what happened. I'm starting to get distracted by all this. Until my buddy @PERSON3 and my boyfriend @PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a @NUM1 pound bucket full of pasta and a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was open. I couldn't believe my eyes and didn't understand why so much. Also, why do they have it. My mom stepped out and yelled, "@CAPS1 Get in the car, let's go!" @CAPS2 We got close to @ORGANIZATION1 and I had a funny feeling deep inside. I looked around and saw that my sister-in-law was holding a video camera. It was then that I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, extraordinary, and I was right. Spaghetti is flying everywhere, getting people's hair and faces. Clothes were soiled and messed up. Not to mention it was cold, wet and raining outside. The fog makes it hard to see who you're hitting and who's throwing at you. I looked even worse when the noodle wars ended. Even now my shoes are soiled. @CAPS2 We got back to my house and we had to hose down. I swear I'll get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel the noodles falling from my hair and clothes and the sauce running down my face. Laugh here, laugh there. Everyone was laughing at how badly others were covered in noodles and sauce. Finally, we were all hungry. We decided to have nachos. So, my mom poured two family-sized nachos on the table, followed by two 10-gallon cans of nacho cheese, olvis. You @MONTH1 think the noodles and sauce are messy, that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS3 dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON3 throws nacho cheese at @LOCATION1, she throws chips at @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON3 threw cheese at me and it landed on my dog. Let's say my living room is a cheese festival. I can't believe the nacho cheese stuck in my dog meat and all the girls' hair. Chip crumbs on the couch, cheese on the floor, @CAPS4 tree. So @PERSON3 finally said "@CAPS5 More nachos!" @CAPS6 is cake time. Jiang thinks there will be no more mess. Well, she was wrong again. They all started singing Happy Birthday, the camera was flashing, and my mom was crying in the background. She cried on our birthday because she said it was a year before her kids moved out. I think she'll get used to it because she knows she's moved out with two kids already. Frosting suddenly appeared on my face! I wiped off the frosting and applied it to @PERSON1's face. Although he just rubbed it back on me. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it to @LOCATION2, then @CAPS3 then @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON3 then @PERSON2. Chocolate frosting and nacho cheese are everywhere. Soon after, we played video games. Of course it's me, I live @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @NUM3 on @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I got annoyed with someone in the game and ended up throwing the controller on my TV and breaking it. After that, my mother was not very happy with me. Oh well, we have to watch a movie in another room. Eventually people started leaving. Say goodbye, goodbye @CAPS6, man. We all said it. I looked back at the living room and said nothing but a mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken TV, I was stuck for over three hours trying to clean up the mess. Still, we kept laughing. Had the best time with each other. I would go back and do it all over again if I could, just for fun and laughter. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH1 won't see it right away. You start laughing though you @CAPS2. Laughing puts everyone in a good mood and a smile on their face. @MONTH1 also makes a mess and drives things crazy. You can't deny that you'll go back and do it again when they're crazy. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call @LOCATION3.
Laughter @PERSON1 Laughter has so many benefits, it can bring distance between two people, or make a difference in our relationship between people. But many others believe and (believe) that laughter is an important part of any relationship with friends, family, etc. Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons why laughter is good for us, and how it keeps us away from people, or how laughter plays a role in our relationships with friends. A lot of people think laughing about simple things is really funny, and I can laugh at things that others might not find funny, but to me they might seem really funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But many others don't find laughter as funny as many others. I believe laughter is an important part of us because it shows those around you who you are and how you express yourself in things. Many of your friends and even your family will know what type of person you are and how stupid you can be at times. That's why I think it's a great idea or (thing) to do and just have some fun and laughs. Now talk about the relationship between people. Do you think laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how does it help us (way)? ? ? ? ? ? Well, yes, I do think that laughter is very important in many of our relationships with people. You begin to understand, and others will understand you and your situation. Although we have many relationships with friends, family or new people we meet. I believe laughter tells you who a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses the character of that person and whether they are funny people. Laughter will even tell you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or no sense of humor at all. When people don't have that much sense of humor, they really can't understand and get the funny part from a joke or anything. I also think laughter is very important for any type of relationship you have with anyone because it makes you get to know that person better. But others believe that laughter is what separates two people from each other. I don't think laughter is the reason people keep their distance. The reason I think and say this is because they have a lot of laughing so hard they almost cry and there is no distance or anything between them. They might get more friends or more people to talk to because other people might also see how that person is, and they might see that it's really fun to be with this person. I know this because I laugh a lot and it doesn't happen to me. That's why I don't think about nor believe that laughter is keeping distance (relationship) between people. In my opinion, I think laughter is a very important part of who we are, how we think, and what we like to do. I mean, you can have some sense of humor, but you don't actually express the way you think about what other people do. Or if something is really stupid and they're a new kid and you or someone else says something you might think it's funny but you might just not want to laugh at that moment because you @MONTH1 A little shy or just because you probably don't know the person either, maybe the other person isn't confident enough to laugh with you because someone just said something stupid. Although many people should still laugh when they want to. Sometimes, if you laugh a lot, you can be the happiest, funniest person anywhere. Or, whenever someone is sad, you may be the only one who can make her/him laugh and be happy. Also, these are some of the reasons why I think laughter is good for you so that people get to know you better. These are a few reasons why laughter can be beneficial and how it can distance people.
Sometimes I get along well with other people, sometimes I don't. There are times when others laugh and cry. Like when my friend and I went to the store once and I started pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, he started laughing so much that he pissed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into a clean cloth and it took him @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS6 what he was doing there and he said. "I'm peeing." @CAPS2 I started rolling on the floor laughing, which is why he laughed at me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. That's because the last time we went in there was a guy talking about his son's football team when my friend and I were both in the top 10. Guss @CAPS6 We really are not. This man is so scared of @CAPS6 that the lady he's talking to probably thinks of him. So @CAPS5 stood up and said to us. "@CAPS4 you let me know that. I thought he was right." @CAPS5 gave us a hug, the man stood up and said. "@CAPS6 about me? Why didn't I hug." When I started laughing harder @CAPS2 Heck. Good thing I don't have to go to the bathroom.
@CAPS4 fills the air around us with happiness and joy, @CAPS4 brings warm memories of loved ones and adds a glimmer of hope to those who need @CAPS4. Laughter is the key to solving life's problems. @CAPS4 is a way to add something special to our lives, and it comes from many different areas of life. Laughs can come from a poor joke someone might tell you, @CAPS4 can be brought up through a show, @CAPS4 can also come from the joy of our loved ones returning from a long trip. Imagine seeing something funny, like a person falling or hitting a pole, and the moment that happens, you hear yourself laughing so hard you can barely breathe while the person standing next to you Laughter was also added. .As rude as @CAPS3 may seem, you just connected with the person next to you and noticed similarities between the two of you. @CAPS3 is the way to build and build friendships, just one little thing that makes you both laugh and bond with each other can spark a whole new friendship between people that can last a minute or a lifetime . In my case, @CAPS3 was how I met one of my closest friends and we saw a student in our class trying to show the class by climbing a flagpole and replacing the @ORGANIZATION1 state flag with his own personal What a cool homemade flag (he got @CAPS1 on the show) and when he was almost halfway to the pole he must have been scared because a few minutes later he started yelling for help and a minute later the faculty finally heard He cries and yells to try to get him down from where he was, it took @CAPS4 almost half an hour to get him down. @CAPS3 is one of the greatest friendships of my life. Many friendships are made in the classroom and with the people you work with, but great friendships are made through the simple laughter that two people share with each other. God has the last laugh. @CAPS3 is the name of @PERSON1, son of @CAPS2 and @PERSON2. In the @CAPS3 story @PERSON2, @PERSON1's @CAPS5 claims she was surprised when she was lucky enough to have her only child, and people will be laughing and amazed as much as they heard the news. Being surprised or shocked can also make some people laugh at what's happening around them or what they've done themselves. I remember one time vessel I laughed and it surprised me, @CAPS4 was when my @CAPS5 lost the keys to the house in the car, we searched for them in each vessel and after an hour went by we didn't find them They we called my dad so he would bring another key to the house and after we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get their keys but when my dad put My @CAPS5 finds her keys lost in her pocket while the car is parked in the driveway (@CAPS4 is a quintessential cartoon moment). When we heard the news, we all started laughing at what just happened, we were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened. As you can see, surprise can also bring smiles and laughter to someone. Imagine yourself staring blankly into the eyes of someone next to you, trying not to give yourself a smirk or a smile, and then finding yourself laughing nonstop for no apparent reason. It's basically an everyday thing for me and my sister. My sister and I couldn't look at each other for even a minute and we ended up laughing for the first five seconds and ended up laughing nonstop for an hour but when we stopped laughing we noticed that we had no apparent reason to laugh, which made Let's laugh for another hour. The kind of laughter that two people who are so close get, the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh at but you end up laughing for no reason. all. @CAPS3 shows the difference between two people You know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memories of holiday family gatherings, friendships we made at school, memories of our childhood, and what we thought was style and cool back then is something we look back on and laugh at now, through a little surprise, also It can be a fact that we know all too well.
Laugh I laugh every day. When I laugh, I feel a lot of different emotions. Some emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. When I laugh, I usually feel happier after an illness because I'm hurt so I cry less. When I'm sad, I tend to laugh and smile to hide the pain I'm feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I'm playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually makes everything worse, not better. When I'm sad, I tend to rely on laughter to get through my day, because if I don't have it, I'll have people asking what's wrong all day and it will drive me crazy. When I'm angry, the only way I can laugh is if a friend or family member is trying to make me happy, or if I'm reminiscing about a good time. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am angry. I also laugh at what people say to me, even when they say it that hurts my feelings, because I don't want them to know that they hurt me. When I'm happy, all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter lights up my life when it's happy. My friends and I could sit there laughing for hours and get nothing. My friends and I are silly sometimes and all we can do is laugh and have fun and be in a good mood and that makes me happy. Some of the things in my life that make me laugh are my nephews, my family and friends. All of these things I just talked about come to my mind when I think about laughter. I think everyone needs some laughter in life to be happy.
Laughter @CAPS1 Laughter is everywhere. @MONTH1 is three doors, reclining in the comfortable living room. @MONTH1 bouncing on the seesaw at the nearest playground. @MONTH1 is in an elegant restaurant, sitting at a small table in the far corner. For me, it lingers in an old fifth grade classroom. I stumbled through the door with my @CAPS11 purple backpack and @CAPS11 lunch leaning pale against @CAPS11's left hand. I recognized everyone from the first few years of @CAPS11 Elementary and joined them shortly after visiting the @CAPS11 hook outside the door. I've been anxiously awaiting the 5th grade @CAPS11 turn. The legendary @PERSON1, known as the "coolest" teacher around. He played a major role in the gossip of young students, and we all had high hopes for him. "@CAPS2 Your seat @NUM1 raters!" announced @PERSON1 @CAPS3 with a contagious smile. The kids scattered around the room looking for seats near their closest friends. Everyone listened carefully to @PERSON1's introduction to the year. His voice captured our full attention, but wasn't too exciting compared to what we expected. He looked fine when most teachers came, but still nothing remarkable. Days dragged on. The sleepy faces are back, and the bright colors have escaped our touch. The day is finally over, and the eager kids are not satisfied. The next day got up quickly and I struggled to get back to my disappointing classroom. To @CAPS11's surprise, the second day was completely different from the first. Classroom @CAPS7 has undergone tremendous changes. Every wall is filled with endless colors. The poster is layered over plain paint with captivating images and text. There is a fancy popcorn machine in the back of the room. Fresh popcorn overflows from the inside. When we enter, the smell goes through the nostrils we need. Mr. @CAPS3 sat contentedly at his large desk as we walked to our seats again. He welcomed us to the next day. After the first few minutes of class, I found out that the rumor was true. He has a simple sense of humour that has caused laughter in every corner of the classroom. His thoughts and words are relevant to us as @NUM1 graders. We found his subtle jokes amusing to our young minds. He talks like we talk, he acts like us, he jokes like we joke. He even created custom nicknames for each of us. The laughter hung over our heads like a heavy @CAPS1 and never continued. While the class is reading aloud, the weekly popcorn server distributes stuffed bags to all children. The kids are ecstatic about the dangerous @CAPS4 gathering the team as fast as possible. His classroom has become a place where we want to stay forever, never leaving our hour-long games and drinking contests. Despite the perpetual fun and games, @PERSON1 shows us what it's really like to be a learner. He cares about our future and pushes us to work hard every moment of our lives. He taught us to write with desire and value. Express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story we want to hear. He would plan one-on-one with students who were struggling with a particular subject, and their confidence had blossomed for the next class. He has the ability to penetrate our minds, find out who we are, and show the hidden confidence to be @CAPS9. We respect him, but also feel comfortable playing with him in class, as he often does to us. @PERSON1 makes us eager to learn. @DATE1 @TIME1 I was already walking home when @PERSON1 @CAPS3 stopped me at the door. "@CAPS6 @PERSON2C!" Unexpectedly high tone, unabashed @CAPS11's enthusiasm. He chuckled, "@CAPS7 did class today have fun?" "@CAPS8 Yes," I replied with a smile. "I'm glad," he continued, before changing the subject, "I'm thinking of having a big dodgeball tournament tomorrow during recess. @CAPS10 thinks that's a good idea?" I snickered, trying to understand a The fact that adults say it to me, "That would be fun." "@CAPS9," he was thrilled, "@CAPS10 is a good kid, @CAPS10 know? It's fun to have @CAPS10 in class. " @CAPS11's face lit up. I stood there and laughed for a long time. We ended our brief conversation and I continued home. Every student in the class craves to be liked by @PERSON1 as if he were the most popular kid at school. I'm liked by @PERSON2 I'm liked by the guy who changed @CAPS11's entire outlook on education and life. Gradually, every now and then, I drifted back to the nonchalant days of @NUM1 grades and @PERSON2, and I still laugh every day at the absurdity that happens in that little classroom every day. Often, I glanced above me and witnessed the dense @CAPS1 still hovering above me. Laughter has left its mark on me, @CAPS11 @NUM1 graders.
Laughter is one of the key components in all my relationships with others. It lightens the mood in any situation and really cheers me up when I'm having a bad day. When I meet new friends, it's often the icebreaker that helps me get closer to friends I already have. On the first day of my freshman year, I met a girl named @LOCATION1. We were in writing class and there was a boy named @CAPS1 sitting between us. @CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedule and he said something that made our conversation a little uncomfortable. I looked up to see @LOCATION1 heard him, the look on her face was somewhere between embarrassed for me and about to laugh. When @CAPS1 turned to leave, I smiled at her and said the word "embarrassed". It's her cue to laugh, and she does it so subtly. I had no idea that this first laugh would lead to more friendships that would develop almost immediately. After the first week of schedule changes and students being shuffled, we found that all of our classes were together except @CAPS3. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done, I'm not sure how we got through all of them. Spending so much time together, it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill the dictionary. Almost any word or just seeing something related to one of our jokes can make us laugh out loud. Sometimes we don't need to say anything at all. I just look at her and we laugh. Because of this, our friends often question our sanity. When we started laughing, they would look at each other and then look at us for clues as to why, or ask if we were okay. They don't know us as well as we know each other. People always mix up our names, even if we don't look alike. Our names don't even rhyme, or start with the same letters. But I really can't blame them. We are so alike! From the activities we engage in to the way we think, we can be almost the same person. She makes me laugh every day, she is one of my best friends. @CAPS4 is another friend of mine who often crashes me. I was always afraid to pee in my pants whenever I was with her. She's not as close to me as @LOCATION1, but we've become better friends this year. We have a lot of classes this year, which is probably why we are getting closer. We always do stupid things together and laugh all the time. For example, she and I like to laugh and exaggerate our "haha" when someone tells a really lame or cheesy joke. Our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes, so when we were in his class, we sat together expecting one of his jokes so we could laugh. We also like to chew gum with our mouths open to make the chew louder. I often laugh until I can't even chew. I know if I'm with @CAPS4 I'll have a great day. She can make me laugh in a way my other friends can't. It came from deep within, to the point where you couldn't even breathe, tears streaming down your face. It makes your whole face sore, even your eyes, from being rubbed for so long. She is a very interesting person and I am so happy to have her as one of my friends. Laughter is a very important part of my relationships with others. Our friendship would be more boring if my friend couldn't make me laugh. Nothing is going to be fun. If I never laugh, I'll never be happy, it's not a life I'm willing to try. Life is hard. It's not easy, and it won't always be smooth sailing. There will be sadness and turbulent waters. But no matter how hard life is for @MONTH1, I know I'll have friends like @LOCATION1 and @CAPS4 out there to share the laughter.
Laughing is like cooking; it brings all kinds of people together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can cause discomfort to you and those around you, like beans. Laughter is a good medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak the @CAPS2 "language" with foreign friends even if you don't know anything about their native language. Laughter varies in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laugh in the world of @CAPS2 for weeks and you laugh out of it. Sometimes in life, laughter is very important! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year, and I arrived early that morning to accompany my friend, whose mom sent her away early because of the traffic conflict. I don't know why we're fighting, or why we're participating in a @CAPS2 specific theme; I just know we've gone down a "rabbit road" and @CAPS4 is taking the plunge for what I did a few weeks ago I separate. Our voices escalated, and despite the fact that our differences didn't turn physically, our words were just as devastating, lashing out below the belt and giving both teams all sorts of 'dark circles' . @CAPS4 is right, I know that, but is @CAPS4 really going to have this self-righteous vibe? I thought, "@CAPS1 @CAPS4 didn't do what @CAPS4 did, I'm not going to give out any secrets." @CAPS2 got me wrong too, but instead of focusing on that, my attention was diverted from her fiery words, Be sure not to let your guard down and start crying or something absurd like that. "That only happened once!" @CAPS4 declared @CAPS4 trying to defend herself. "The @CAPS3 way, you don't have to tell the world!" "I didn't tell the world," I objected. "I only told one person...who told one person, who told another...etc." @CAPS4 raised an eyebrow, like @CAPS1 said, "@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm doing what." was talking. " The air in the room was as stiff as the direction we were arguing, nowhere to go, meaningless. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 did it with me, I did it with her. @CAPS4 casually leaned against Wall, trying to show indifference, as her ankles succumb to gravity and the current humidity, scraping the surface and causing her to lose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 ever thrown out the window. Her shoes hit the smooth tiled surface, the downpour that morning left hundreds of footsteps, drenched. Crash, @CAPS4 met the relentless stone floor, @CAPS7! It made her Face gaped, pride changed. I wish the conversation went like this - she's less than three feet tall and I'm towering over her. To disguise the slight satisfaction lurking behind the dimple, I slid down slowly Standing on the wall behind me, level with her eyes. I looked her in the eyes, @CAPS1 they waved the white flag and left me in a smug victory. I craned my neck back and smiled at the ceiling .I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought at first, but it was slow, but sure enough, @CAPS4 laughed. My giggles caused a burst of laughter, she caught it, and soon we were both lying down On the floor. There's nothing special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it's the bleak stone on which we end up lying with our heads curled up and our hands on our stomachs, trying to get our Breathing back to normal that morning. Of course, I apologize and @CAPS4 accepts, but I think her forgiveness is self-evident; laughter doesn't depend on words. "@CAPS8," @CAPS4 laughed. Me and The laughter shared by friends in that preschool classroom spread throughout the day. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. " It's that distance that gives reassurance to the relationships I share with my friends. No, it doesn't solve our problems, but it reminds us how stupid and pointless our petty arguments are, and definitely worth a laugh. Her fall from grace sparked a look of innocent surrender in me, laughter, but what ended it all was the release of bitterness and laughter that welcomed both sides. So, no, while we're not on the same wave of bravery, our laughter is more than We took sides - we still spoke the same "language".
Laughter Laughter's @CAPS1 is one of the best feelings a person can achieve. When you're sad, angry, or arguing, laughing can turn any negative emotion into a good one. While you @MONTH1 don't want to show a shift in mood, it's hard not to show it. Laughter is an important thing in your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it's a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it can completely change a person's mood. It's better to laugh with someone. Having relationships that are filled with laughter is an important factor in a person's happiness. Sharing @CAPS3 is a great way to build friendships and stay prosperous. Relationships without laughter end quickly. It's almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed on a regular basis in relationships. Without it, there is no connection, joy or excitement. If you can't @CAPS3 with someone, you have nothing in common. People need humorous relationships. Laughter connects people at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled "I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3". I would watch it countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever this video is played, we will happily reminisce about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together took my family relationship to its highest point. Relationships are very important; including laughter only makes them stronger. Laughter is not only important, but contagious. Laughter can ease difficult situations and lift everyone's spirits. It's hard not to @CAPS3 when others are laughing. Everyone has their own @CAPS3 too. Sometimes it's someone's @CAPS3 that gets the group laughing. It's also a wonderful feeling to have someone @CAPS3. Comedians make a career of making people @CAPS3. Good feelings come when you can @CAPS3 someone. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he sets jokes. He knows how to get people @CAPS3. All one's friendships require someone who lifts the spirits. However, laughter should not come from making fun of someone. It should come from a situation or situation faced by the @MONTH1 group. This is the key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing power of laughter is real, and they work. There has been research on how laughter heals the body. Something like laughter therapy is a very real therapy for people in trouble. Norman @CAPS4's book Laughter is the Best Medicine explains the power of laughter in detail. @CAPS4 watched @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and laughed at their health. He showed that a person needs laughter to be healthy. Laughter is very important to a person's health. It lifts the spirit and relieves the mood. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if a person does not have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 is not as healthy as he should be. If your friendship lacks humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings a person needs to surround themselves with in life.
In this article, I'll tell you why laughter, conflict, and trust are so important in a relationship. I have a good relationship with my cousin. We would laugh, we would fight, but always trust each other in everything. We have known each other and have been together for the past @NUM1 years. Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more than anyone in the world. One thing that does bring us closer is that we laugh at each other's mistakes. When one of us screwed up, the other would laugh at them and then try to help fix the problem. When one of us does screw something up, we're always the first to know what or who it's with, even if we don't like the other person they're having a problem with. Conflict, I think is another thing that I think is very important in a good relationship. I've been arguing with her. Even if it's the smallest and dumbest thing. We can always find a way to fight over something. If it's for another mess it could or will totally mess up my or her life. We protect each other from making a mess of life. We stop each other from doing very stupid things. We have a strange feeling when the other person is hurt or may be hurt by someone or something. Trust is very important in a relationship. Trust that you can be there or tell someone anything, no matter what it is. Everything she and I are about each other now. If you want to know something about me now, you can go to her and she can tell you. If you want to know something about her right now, you can go to me and I can tell you. I can tell her anything, even if she will be mad at me for a while, if I really need her by my side, I will now she will asap. We almost never judge each other for what they have done or will do. We now know what others did, and what they didn't. If I had to, I would trust her with my life. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister and everything. She and I would always laugh at each other's mistakes. We'll always have some type of conflict with each other, but whatever the reason @MONTH1, we'll always be there to help each other. These are @NUM3 things, I think you need to have a good relationship with someone like me and my cousin @CAPS1. I still have this relationship with her and no matter how hard I try I can never lose it and now she will always be there for me.
the bell rang. Shuffle, shuffle. @CAPS1. break. EEEE. crack. Grand Slam. Click, stomp, @CAPS1. Tap tap. Grand Slam. squeak. Whoosh whoosh. sigh. Seventh class of the day. it has started. "@CAPS2! Tu va ou pas? At +¬tude cette class-l+á. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...." @CAPS3 all wink at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate Colored hair and mocha skin, waiting impatiently for my answer. The truth is, I know @CAPS3 doesn't really care if I come. If I'm a few feet behind like a poor puppy, it doesn't make any difference to them. I'm silent but cute and loved only because I'm @CAPS4. Because I said fret @CAPS5. Because I was an exchange student because my translation and colorful clothes were shocking for ten seconds and then forgotten. I'm a flock of seagulls getting a haircut. Then why are you here? I think. Why are you doing an exchange? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. Nobody wants you. Just go home. But my ego has a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months, this was what you wanted, what you thought, what you dreamed of. So I went with the girls. Unsurprisingly, @CAPS3 walked down the three-wide staircase side by side, and I dragged awkwardly behind them. Finally got to @NUM2scalier and we were sitting at a table with three girls chatting. I stared, trying to get myself lost in thought, as if I didn't care that I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts are buzzing in my head; if @CAPS3 isn't talking to me, why should I try to talk to them? I really don't know how @CAPS3 feels about me. How does someone see their shadow? @CAPS3 noticed it, sure, but it never provides insight, it never makes you laugh. Everything is confidence, my mother's voice says, everything is your own way. But I know it's not that simple. I am so unfamiliar. These girls will never understand me because I will never understand them. Frustrated, I started to spoon the peas across the room. Pat, flick, sprout. This piqued @PERSON1's interest as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 are discussing something very emotional. Tears began to flow from @ORGANIZATION1. Sniffling, she went to the bathroom with @NUM1le, leaving me alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 can feel my emotions as he stares at @CAPS6. I silently continued to shoot peas. @PERSON1 just staring at them, @CAPS3 flying around the room. Suddenly, in a terrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. Then, he turned and swore. Then @PERSON1 and I looked at each other across the table. Then we laughed. We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge alien tears welled up in my eyes. People around us are laughing too, though @CAPS3 don't know what's funny. I don't even know what's funny. But that's okay, because with tears and snot, we reach out to each other and reenact the pea hitting the boy in the face. It's like we've been friends for years and the laughter keeps happening. It's filled with all the anxiety, loneliness and hopelessness I've felt for the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightning, the kind of connection my best friend and I felt at home. I felt a huge swelling in my chest, like a balloon got stuck in it. My stomach hurts, my cheeks hurt and I feel like they're gripping. Even in that second, my heart felt whole. My soul is open. This is the best laugh of my life. Pump, pump, pump. pant. laughter. pant. Tears flowed down my face. Pump, pump, pump. laughter. pant. This is why. I think. That's why you came. the bell rang.
I didn't believe my grandfather when @CAPS2 told me that laughter cures anything. I'm nine years old and it's dark @CAPS3 cold @CAPS3 I feel like my life is like a broken glass window. Not only @PERSON2, my ageless bulldog, just died @CAPS6, my sister would make fun of me if I dared to cry over losing my best pet. I sat on the coach and stared at the crackling fire that burst @CAPS3 as my grandfather sat next to me @CAPS3 told me a story. It's about him, @CAPS3 also lost @CAPS1's best friend when @CAPS2 was young, only @CAPS1 friends are not pets. "@CAPS1's name is @PERSON3," @CAPS2 began, "@CAPS3 We're only 11. Oh how much fun we had. All we did was @CAPS7! We thought we'd grow old together @CAPS3 become every Personal other best man @CAPS3 got in trouble telling the ending. @CAPS2 was my best friend till the end. I love him so much that you love @PERSON2. I never thought anything would happen to him. I thought we will live forever. @CAPS6 Then something did happen. @PERSON3, @CAPS2 went fishing alone because I had to work at church @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @CAPS4, @CAPS3 it was a good day @CAPS11 to the river @ CAPS6 and then @CAPS2 never came back from the river..." @CAPS5 scoffed at the old story, "@CAPS6 You see @PERSON1, there is a cure for grief. Do you want to know @CAPS9 what it is?" I Nodding, half-thinking there is a magic drug or spell. "@CAPS7." @CAPS2 said. "@CAPS9?!" I was completely shocked. "@CAPS10, it's easy," @CAPS2 said softly, knowing my tantrums, "@CAPS11 going through the grieving phase. Lost a little, @CAPS6 and find your way home. @CAPS7 in your heart @ CAPS3 will always be. Go with the flow @CAPS3 @CAPS11 and find a wave of joy. Love life because, as you just saw, it can be so short." I nod @CAPS6 without seeing @CAPS1's sober face. @CAPS2 kissed the top of my head. @CAPS2 look me in the eyes (I can't get enough of @CAPS1's intensity) @CAPS3 I know @CAPS2 sees the reflection of the fire in my watery green-blue eyes @CAPS3 can see my processing @CAPS9 @CAPS2 just told me. Then @CAPS2 left me thinking alone. Do I need to move on? how? Life is not that easy. I know. I open my notebook to do some homework and get my mind off @PERSON2, @CAPS5, @CAPS3 @PERSON3. That's when I found a small piece of paper the size of a playing card. I turned it over to reveal that it was a photo. A tear spilled from the corner of his eye. It's me @CAPS3 @PERSON2. We were both in a mud pit. My blonde hair looks muddy (considering I've been rolling in mud). My bulldog rubbed @CAPS1's greasy head on my shoulders and smeared more dirt on myself. I laughed and missed him even more, @CAPS6 feels better than a minute ago. I have loved him. I love him very much. I still do it today, @CAPS6 I had to get over my friend gone. I laughed to myself after seeing this photo, unconsciously feeling like such a horrible granddaughter @CAPS3, an inconsiderate good friend. @CAPS6 Seeing the good times we had and @CAPS3 smiling makes me feel better about myself. Ok? Maybe laughter is the medicine for anything.
@DATE1 is the beginning of a new era, I just turned @NUM1 and I thought what a joy it was. I'm so present for my birthday party, I can't even stand it. My mom asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday, and I told her I wanted to throw a party and get some sleep. She agreed, so that night we planned and sent out an invitation. That week flew by, and before I got a new one, it was party time. I invited @NUM2 my best friends and all my family. We had a lot of fun, time flies, it's time for everyone to go, three of my friends were there for the night, @PERSON1, Barbie and @CAPS1. My parents attended their own party and we stayed home alone all night. It was around @TIME1 and we were all looking at the mountain with eyes. We all had a big meltdown, from stardom, we all went to stardom, and we all freaked out to see myself getting knocked over. We ran off the stars screaming and I called my mom thinking there was someone at home and they rushed home thinking it was a real emergency. My mom and dad went up to the star to check and they found it was my black cat and mouse, he entered through my window and jumped on me, not strong enough it clapped.
The bus flies around in tightly wound corners. Outside the window, farm fields, rocky cliffs and calm rivers flow. I was so exhausted by the fourteen-hour flight that I barely knew what time it was. The only thing keeping me awake is the bumps of the bus and @NUM1 other @CAPS1 I hardly know gossip quietly. We're going to visit and live with a group of high school students affectionately known as "our @CAPS2". I've only met @CAPS16's partner @LOCATION1 once. Everything I know about her, her life, her family is what I've learned from about ten messages, maybe @NUM2 short @CAPS3 messages. There will be problems with communication. @CAPS16 Mom started teaching me @CAPS4 when I was 2, but I'm nowhere near fluent; I'm self-conscious and uncomfortable with native speakers. @PERSON1's @CAPS5 is good, but her family only says @CAPS4. Finally, the bus travels along the narrow cobblestone streets of @CAPS7. It stopped in a square packed with people. The door hissed open and we lined up, tiptoeing in search of our new family. All around me, people are chattering about a mix of @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERSON1 and her parents are waiting somewhere in the middle as I slowly wave @CAPS16 to them. Brigitte, @CAPS16's boarding mom, hugs me. "@CAPS10 gehts? @CAPS10 war dein @PERSON2? @CAPS18 how are you? How is your flight?" @CAPS11 of @CAPS16 @CAPS4, I hesitated, "@CAPS13 @PERSON2 war sehr langalso ich bin ein bisschen muede It's a long flight, so I'm a little tired." @PERSON1 took @CAPS16's arm and led me up the hill to the school, where our welcome dinner was being held. She explained: "@CAPS14 nice to meet you. @CAPS7 is too small and we never host tourists. We only host @CAPS15 exchange students every other year." @CAPS16's stomach filled with that jittery anticipation . Usually, making friends is easy for me, but this time was different. I know very little about the language and culture of the people around me. Long flight is evident under @CAPS16's sleepless bags under eyes and @CAPS16's greasy, knotted hair. @CAPS16 The jet-lag brain wonders how I'm going to get along with these people. Will I adapt and get into @CAPS4 life smoothly? We walked from the old street to a dimly lit tunnel entrance. After a few turns, we came to an empty yard. Several tables were filled with a dazzling array of food, and the smell of grilled sausages wafted in the air. "@CAPS18 Are you hungry? You should eat something. We have a lot of food here," @PERSON1 told me. I grabbed a plate and put a roll, strawberries and a sausage on it. I was so anxious, I was really hungry. @PERSON1 leads me to a shabby table with wooden stools where her friends are already enjoying dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I sat stiffly on the edge of my seat. @CAPS14 enthusiastically asked me about @CAPS15's life. As @CAPS14 relaxes, they start joking, sometimes at @CAPS4, sometimes at @CAPS5. Some @CAPS2 mocked my @CAPS16 accent. This is not a mean tease. They're not malicious, just lighthearted and fun. So I laughed. At that moment, I seemed more suited to these people that I only understood occasionally. I am no longer a foreigner, but a new friend. Relax, I allow myself to laugh at @CAPS16's mistakes and really enjoy being in a whole new place.
My friend @PERSON1 and my @CAPS1 friend started back in sixth grade. We've been through so much together @CAPS1. Even though we didn't have anything in common and didn't hang out together, there was a lot of laughter in our friendship outside of school. I say if you're going to have a lasting friendship, you have to laugh in it and make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON1 and I were in @NUM1 grade, we were the biggest in 6th grade because we were the top of our middle school. We have a lot to do. @PERSON1, I'm always walking down the hallway linking our arms together, and after a while, she'll shove me on top of someone. It sucks that someone would break into a locker or a wall and we would just laugh. It was fun for us, but others mind it a little bit, but it's not bad. Another thing we do is make ourselves laugh when @PERSON1 and I are arguing. It always starts with one of us trying to put something in each other's mouths. I always try to put a piece of paper in her mouth to make me stop and @PERSON1 will tease me. @PERSON1 New, I'm like the itchy guy on earth. It happened once in front of our school office. We tickled and tickled each other until we laughed the shit out of the flour. Well, a teacher came and told us to stop, and the bell rang, so we went to class. @PERSON1 is an office assistant, so when she went to the office, apparently one of the people in the office saw us tickling each other and thought we were going somewhere. @PERSON1 told me she just said "@CAPS3" and started chuckling. I laughed out loud about it. Laughter is a good thing for me because without it @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be the best friends we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started with laughter. I met @PERSON1 in my sixth grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher assigned seats and @PERSON1 and I and 2 others had to sit together. I didn't know who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing and soon she introduced herself and I did too. Well, the seating arrangement changed, she sat somewhere, and so did I. Well, the person she sat next to moved away. I got bad grades in @CAPS4 class, I told my teacher I didn't get along well with the people at the table and asked if I could sit somewhere else. He told me yes, so I walked over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit on before he moved. She told me she didn't care, and we started hanging out at school together and having a good time. So you see. Laughter is a pleasant thing in many people's lives. you need it. Without it, I would never have been the best friend I have today. I want to thank her for getting me through a difficult time. Without the laughter of this world, we could be lost. Think about what you might not have, or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life.
I remember my freshman year on the football team, we played the Bulldogs at @LOCATION1. We lost in the first half and one of our goalkeepers injured his hand before the end of the first half. So they took him out and they put another goalie in and one of the other players kicked the ball too hard and hit the goalie in the stomach. So it blew his wind out and me and the hollow football team started laughing because it was funny how he jumped up and down and said he was going to pass out and he just blew his wind away. So the first injured goalie has to go in because nobody wants to go in as a goalie because they're afraid they'll score. We scored @NUM1 goals after the first half, so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3. The reason we laugh at the goalkeeper is because he's funny how he reacts when they blow his wind out. Also because he's our friend, because if he were we wouldn't laugh, but after the game we asked him if he was okay and he said he was just pretending, even though he really wasn't. The main reason it's all funny is because one of our goalkeepers got blown over by the wind and when he just blew the wind down he overreacted and he said he was going to pass out and when he said that he was right smiled at him, as if he was pretending.
Laughter comes when you are happy. Laughter is there when we're having a good time, and it makes us smile when we're in a good mood. A lot of times things happen that will make you laugh. For example; someone tripped over your backpack, @CAPS7 fell over @CAPS3 their face. You can't stop laughing! Then you start feeling bad and hope you don't laugh at them for tripping, but then you start thinking about how @CAPS7 fell and you think about it, and you end up laughing so hard that you're in trouble Can't stop. Laughter is an important part of your life, at least not when you don't laugh during the day. Everyone in my family is funny and @CAPS7 always makes me laugh. They weren't when we were quiet and one of us had to say "embarrassing silence". We are always laughing and happy, we are never sad. Let me tell you that my family was laughing once when we went back in time to reminisce about those times we now call "the good old days." I will tell you that laughter is an important part of my family. and the level of embarrassment. It's a sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today is a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. That was the day I was going to the @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1, and sat down in a chair at @CAPS3 to get my hair done. I'm wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas and a black shirt that says "@CAPS2 @CAPS3". I did my hair, makeup, dress @CAPS3, went out for photos, and bought @CAPS3 a limo so I could go to church. After going to church, I took a photo with my family, then went to @CAPS4 for a photo in the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After returning from @CAPS4, I went to @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, ready for my waltz. I played my first waltz in the Court of Honor; six boys and six girls with my partner. After the waltz, my dad and I danced a second waltz. When my dad and I were done dancing, I was ready for the surprise dance party. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner, and finally the most important part... Girls, one of my uncle's guys, ran to the right instead of the left and misspelled my name! These guys were supposed to spell "@ORGANIZATION2" and both were wearing black @CAPS3 on each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling "@CAPS8"! The other guy saw the error right away, so he moved left, and since my uncle didn't move left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling "@CAPS9"! I'm not gonna lie... I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong place because the letters were going in my direction but I could stop that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't ! But in the end it was fun. Everyone inside started laughing and I was so embarrassed! But when I got off the dance floor, I started laughing! Thinking about it now, this is the funniest thing that has ever happened to our family. I think when something embarrassing happens, there's really laughter. Laughter comes when you are happy. Laughter is there when we're having a good time, and it makes us smile when we're in a good mood. But when we're embarrassed, the laughter is always there. Laughter is always with us. Whether we mean it or not, we end up doing stupid things that make us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. The laughter is with me because my family is funny and crazy and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matter if we are sad because one of my family members was in a car accident or someone died, we will remember our happy times and the times we had fun with that person. We ended up remembering the fun we had together and we started laughing a lot! The laughter is there when we're happy, but it's also there when it's the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness.
Laughing is a good thing, except in certain circumstances. We've all been there. Spend quality time with friends, laugh and create new memories. Then you drink something and start laughing again. Next thing you know you're choking and can't breathe. You cough as hard as you can, trying to stop. Not only is it a little awkward, but it can also get a little awkward. You can't stop it, you just have to go with the flow. Everyone stared and asked if you were okay. That moment felt like forever, that's exactly how I felt. I have two best friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. It was during @DATE1 and we decided to host a small movie night at @ORGANIZATION3's house. We're fully prepared for candy, soda, and the best pizza ever. It all adds up to a great night. We decided to watch the movie @ORGANIZATION1. It's all our favorites and I don't think we'll ever get tired of it. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and I found comfortable seating and started watching a movie. We ate, laughed and commented. We have fun. Then I decided to drink my @ORGANIZATION2. I was about to swallow it, but just by my luck, one of the funniest parts of the movie begins. I started laughing, knowing I had a problem. I put the cup on the table, got off the couch quickly, took two steps, and most of the @LOCATION1 in my mouth flew to the floor. I can't breathe and I'm coughing now, so I run all the way to my destination, the kitchen sink. I'm about two feet away from the sink and I'm so close! Then I felt something pop out of my mouth and I couldn't control it. I'm not going to open my mouth, it will be on the floor! I was so disgusted I basically threw myself in the sink. I opened my mouth and the vomit flowed into the sink. I keep coughing and don't know when this will end. "@CAPS2 how are you?!" @CAPS1 ran into the kitchen and started hitting my upper back, trying to help me. @CAPS5 hit me three times and I can finally breathe again. "@CAPS4 you, I'm so sorry." @CAPS5 starts laughing, and I'm still disgusted by the bad taste in my mouth. I buried my head under the faucet trying to clean it up a bit. I took a towel and we went to the living room. We entered the room to find @PERSON1 sitting on the couch laughing hysterically. @CAPS1 sat next to her and started giggling with her. I got down on my knees and started mopping the @ORGANIZATION2 spill on the floor. Not too much, but still a good amount. I started chuckling to myself as I cleaned it up. I thought to myself, "@CAPS6 must be me choking?" "@CAPS6 didn't you just go to the sink? I mean it's there!" @PERSON1 points to the door and still laughs. "I didn't think so! I just ran to the kitchen!" I've been to her house many times before, but the bathroom made me forget. I laughed how many blonde moments I just had. "@CAPS8 OMG," @CAPS5 smiled slightly, before continuing, "@CAPS9 my @CAPS10! When I saved you!" "@CAPS11 Get up and watch a movie!" I told her jokingly. @CAPS5 After laughing, we started enjoying the movie quietly again. They both still make fun of me for it, but I don't mind. It just shows you what laughter can do unexpectedly.
Is there someone you know who makes you smile like everyone else? Or have a moment or @DATE1 when you laugh like there's no tomorrow? Laughter is something everyone can relate to, regardless of age or personality. It fills you with a warm feeling that pours out like a waterfall. There is not always a reason for what people do, there is always a mystery. The same applies to laughter. Sometimes you're just so happy that it all piles up inside and has to be released. My friend @PERSON1 and I were practically inseparable during my 6th grade @DATE2, 7th grade. @PERSON1 was my first friend who moved in from @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 at the beginning of 6th grade, but we became best friends in a short time. We are alone at my house at @DATE1 and we want to do something fun and creative. So we decided to make a fort out of sheets and furniture. We took chairs and some sofa ends and the @DATE1 table and tied sheets and blankets from them, fell on ourselves and didn't notice anything else. We made a fabric plane about three or four feet off the ground, high enough to crawl under and sit down. We then tacked a tack to the wall and pinned it to the slab to serve as our wall. We then filled the makeshift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on. By the time of our adventurous @DATE1, the living room was a mess with furniture all over the place. It was as if a tornado had passed through the house, even though it wasn't the biggest or best fort we've ever built. But we didn't care, we had fun building it. I remember sitting in the fort talking to her about anything that came up. We talked about school, people and life in general. We joked like we liked to do, just feeding off of each other's good feelings and energy. I'm on cloud nine and no one wants to let me down. That @DATE1, I laughed like there was nothing wrong in the world. I'm carefree and not afraid to show it. We both laughed almost to the point of tears, although when I look back now on some of the things we used to laugh at, it wasn't that funny. It was one of those days of laughter that filled you with energy and joy that you couldn’t even control yourself, and it was so contagious that other people couldn’t help but join you. We indulge ourselves in cheers and giggles. I've never laughed so hard in my life and I don't want to stop. Not necessarily because @PERSON1 has done or said something funny, but I'm glad it all seems to be laughable. Every time I started laughing, she couldn't help but join me, which only made us laugh harder. By @DATE1, we were all down. @PERSON1 ended up staying one night because we never wanted @DATE1 to leave. But, in the end, every @DATE1 ends, every morning is a new beginning, every night is @DATE1 doing something, but when you close your eyes and sleep after a long @DATE1 laugh, you will feel full. Not happiness, but life. And that feeling cannot be easily taken away. So live and laugh like today is the last time @DATE1 and never forget the memories you made in previous times.
@CAPS1 Laughter in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 My laughter is important, we all laugh in life. It's a symbol of happiness and it shows those around us that we care enough @CAPS3 to listen and pay attention. With laughter, we can create memories that last a lifetime. For me and my friends, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since 2nd grade and have been friends ever since. What keeps our @CAPS2 strong and alive today is the memory we create through laughter. Still, @CAPS3 always seems to have a memory of the first time we went to an inner tube together. There are so many memories between @PERSON1 and I as we share laughter. However, the memory that always dominates is when we first got into the inner tube. It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we planned to be together as much as possible. Now this doesn't really work because I have a lot of @CAPS3 babysitters, but she's a good friend and understands. So it's always fun when we hang out. Now yes, we've had ups and downs, and any @CAPS2 has. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. @DATE1 We'll hang out in each other's houses and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parents decided they wanted @CAPS3 to take a lake trip @CAPS3 to go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 to come along, so I asked, I was able to @CAPS3 go to @CAPS3 lake with their family. I've been boating before and @CAPS3 is the lake we're going to. What I didn't expect was that @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 got into the inner tube. It's both exciting and nerve-wracking. I've never laughed so much at @LOCATION1 in my life. Going the inner tube turns out @CAPS3 is one of the fondest memories we've had together. Throughout @DATE1, whenever possible, we got into the inner tube and for me the adrenaline was almost addicting. The laughter is almost always constant while rowing because we just had the best time. Here's a new story we @CAPS3 tell you all, and we're all proud of it. When using inner tubes, we learned that @CAPS3 can work together, which helped our @CAPS2 in a way. Also, @CAPS3 gets to the point where we go as fast and as crazy as we can when using inner tubes, and we love it. @DATE1 We have some of my most precious memories and we really owe it all @CAPS3 for laughs. With laughter, we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I'm so grateful for that. If it weren't for the laughter, I don't know where my @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 would be standing. Because of this, I believe laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness, and that's what makes life beautiful.
I've always loved laughter all my life and I don't know how I could live without it. This is where it all started. One day, I was not having a good time. Nothing makes me laugh. Friends tell my jokes, they make faces. That just didn't make me laugh a little bit. There was only one thing they didn't try that made me laugh until my sister did that. I will never forget the day my sister and I played water polo. On a hot @DATE1 day my sister and I were always having a water balloon fight and this time she went through a water balloon and it hit me in the face. I also passed a water balloon and guess what happened when it hit her face. We just couldn't stop laughing and all the laughter took our breath away. My sister decided to tell me this story when I was having a bad day, even when people tried to make it better by making me laugh. One thing no one said was there was one during @DATE1. Until my sister reminded me and told me that story. I just started laughing from that day. Then my sister took me out and she had all the water balloons ready and we started going through each other. I was in a bad mood that day, but it turned out to be the best day of my life. It was a day I will never forget the laughter. That's why I love to laugh in my life, it just turns my bad days into the best days of my life.
One day my friend Tyler and I thought of taking his quad and tying a rope to the back on a snowy day. He was drifting on a post and he didn't see the mountain, I was on a sled and I flew over the quad , was about @NUM1 feet tall, and bumped it hurt, but it was so funny we both laughed for ten minutes. Then we went back to his creek where the ice was about @NUM2 inches thick and then I was driven out of the quad and he was in the back and I was driving along the shore and he was on the ice and then it started cracking so I walked faster so he didn't fall off and about two minutes later the ice cracked and he fell over and then I got him out and I drove fast and the foursome could go back to his house and he changed After getting dressed, he just sat there laughing at what we both did for hours.
Laughter is used in any situation. Many times I've been in awkward situations and I've used laughter to get rid of the discomfort. The laughter never goes away and you'll always have it with you when the offending moment calls for it. For example, @CAPS1 A month ago I went for a walk in the park with my brother and some of my friends. When we arrived, there were already people at the skatepark where we wanted to skate. We decided it was no big deal and we'd get on with our business and skateboarding. "@CAPS2 punks! We're here first!" said one. My brother and I started yelling. Then one of them started saying a bunch of crap in my face, so I said some of @CAPS1's words and it was funny and all his friends laughed. He was pissed, but that was okay because we ended up skating there and nothing happened. It just goes to show that laughter can bring us all together in any moment of giving. It's always fun no matter the skin color or who's from you. Some are more fun than others, but everyone has a sense of humor. You can always find time to make a joke or come up with a clever hilarious line that will make some people laugh. Laughter is one thing you can rely on when you're in an awkward position or going to a new school or a place you've never been before. In any case, laughter will always keep you away from arguments. People all over the world laugh at this moment and use it as a bond. It is a symbol of happiness and gratitude. Laughter has a purpose and never goes away. Laughter is the bond. Union is love. Laughter and laughter together.
When we learned about the benefits of laughter, we realized we couldn't live without it. It's one of those things we get through hard times and one of the joys of life. So when people say "laughing is the shortest distance between two people", that's right! You can think whatever you want, but I want you to know that when it comes to the boy I'm in love with, I have the best laugh in the world. It all started with a curved softball tournament. Our team drove there for our races over the weekend and we stayed at the @LOCATION2 inn hotel. By the way, it was very good and probably good for our team because we ended up destroying the place like a bunch of footballers in the dressing room, so training hard. After practice, we continued to swim in the pool, even knowing we had a big game the next day. The hotel has two large swimming pools, one outside and one inside, with a sauna. We all went to the inner pool as it was cold outside. Then everything from there is a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I went to the sauna after a swim to relax and chat. After a while, while we were still inside, two boys about our age entered the sauna. They acted like they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us, which was undoubtedly a little awkward. When it comes to boys, I'm not shy about speaking my mind and asking why they're just sitting there pretending to mind their own business, and I know the truth isn't why. We chatted for a while and got to know each other. One of them is very cute and I hit it off with him. It came later to @TIME1, it's time for us all to go back to our rooms and say goodbye forever. I share a room with @PERSON3 and her parents. I know @PERSON3 gave my phone number to @PERSON1, the guy I kind of like in the sauna. About ten minutes later, I got a text that said "Find me outside". So I think it's him that's funny and I'm excited! So we sneaked out of the room for @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel chatting and he was barefoot and lovely. I have never laughed so much in my life! He made me smile and felt like I could put everything that was going on together. About forty-five minutes passed, still staring into each other's eyes, it felt like only a second. His friend @PERSON2 saw someone walking out of the hotel room and realized it was his mom. They said goodbye in a hurry, and at the last second he kissed me on the cheek to say goodbye. I have never experienced something so exciting and fun in my life and most importantly I understand the importance of laughing. Knowing that I'll never see him again is what killed me. He lives in @CAPS1 and I live in @LOCATION1. How could something happen between us? Maybe one day I will see him again. Maybe one day I can talk to him again like @TIME1 and maybe, I'll fall in love with him. All of this may have come true because I gave up on the right things, and I waited. It feels like everything is happening now and I can think about and connect with laughter and how it affects my life. That's what brought us together, and I'm so glad it all happened so quickly in my young life.
I keep my head down as I walk through the halls of the brand new school I signed up for. The students walked past me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare look them in the eye, I couldn't. This is the real school, I thought. I've been homeschooled for as long as I can remember and now my parents feel like I should be introduced to a public school in my final year of secondary school @CAPS12 less. When I entered my first acting class, my dark curly brown hair fell down my face. The students began to recite their lines, and the room was warm and dimly lit. The sets are so colorful, I immediately recognized them as @LOCATION2's garden in @LOCATION1. My foot caught on the doorstop, and a sudden shriek sent me tumbling down my chair. When I looked up and saw that every student in the room was staring at me, the crimson color flooded my cheeks. I sighed in distress and brushed my hair to my face, wishing I'd come home and sit in my favorite chair studying for my mom's vocabulary test. I glanced at my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized @CAPS12 was in the spotlight. "@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, new student." @PERSON1 enthused. I smiled and nodded slowly, "@CAPS3, that's me." @CAPS4 smiles at me like I smile at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smiles sadly, "Sorry honey, but everything about this show Part of it has already been filmed, but you are more than welcome to help arrange the next class." I nodded, reached into my backpack, pulled out a book, and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was immediately transported to another time and place, and I wish with all my heart that I could actually go there. When a little girl who looked like an elf sat down next to me, I suddenly woke up from my imagination. @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a while, just looked at me. @CAPS13 has darker hair than mine and darker than brown, but @CAPS4 wears @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13's bright blue eyes sparkle with imagination, as does @CAPS13's face. Something about @CAPS13 seems kind. Maybe @CAPS14 is the way @CAPS13's dimples appear, even if @CAPS4 isn't smiling, or @CAPS14 may be the way @CAPS4 sits, tall and confident. "Hello @CAPS5?" I muttered, closing the book and carefully marking the pages. "I didn't mean to interrupt, you were just watching, I thought I was coming over to say hi. My name is @CAPS6, everyone calls me @CAPS7." @CAPS4 laughed again, letting @CAPS13's dimples more prominent. I chuckled and smiled back at @CAPS13, "@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you." "@CAPS10, don't go the wrong way, but you're not from here, are you?" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly road. My smile sank slightly, "@CAPS12, I've always been homeschooled, I've never actually been to a public school before." @CAPS13 The smile died with me, and I could tell @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about. "@CAPS14 isn't always a bad thing, I'm glad I can finally go to public school," I muttered, lying easily. @CAPS4 laughs and puts a soft hand on my shoulder, "@CAPS12 needs to lie." I know @CAPS13 is half serious, other jokes, but something deep inside me happened Variety. I barely know this girl, but I feel like I can trust @CAPS13 and we can be friends. The rest of us in the class were laughing and joking, and I was almost always drawn to the way @CAPS4 kept getting flustered trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4 will try to use @CAPS13's hand, make moves, just to explain, it always throws us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous the two of us are, and when the lunch bell rings, I freak out Jump, does time really pass so quickly? @CAPS7 smiles at me, "@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?" I have a smile on my face, maybe I'm not as lonely as I thought. Just a few giggles and the whole friendship is rooted in a land that I don't think can hold any life at all. Just by opening up a little and showing vulnerability and even fear, I opened the door to future conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets, but most of all, hope. This place @CAPS12 is no longer a place of torture, exclusion and grief, but a place where I can go to meet my new friend, a friend who will eventually become my sister, a woman I begin to trust and understand with all my heart, I Finally realized that we are not as different as I once thought. We have always been alone.
I'll tell you some moments, sometimes even adventures with a boy named @CAPS1.C. @CAPS4 has neck-length brown hair and @CAPS4 loves to dangle like in the movies. @CAPS4 definitely don't like his bangs cut short, otherwise the whirlwind wouldn't come out the same way. @CAPS4's brown eyes seem to be sparkling and the smile seems to fool everyone. "@CAPS2, @CAPS4 are so cute," they said. "@CAPS2, @CAPS4 are so cute," they said. @CAPS1.C is cute, but does something that will blow your mind! Something you wouldn't think a kid his age could do. As I always say, "@CAPS4 will make you work for the money!" The problem is the only @NUM1 year old of @CAPS4, now @CAPS17. @CAPS4 loves following, and @CAPS4 can do almost anything for it. Yet @CAPS4 is very cute and sometimes sweet. @CAPS4 loves comedy, cartoons, candy, video games and productions. @CAPS1.C is fun, trust me, I say you'll never get bored! I think @CAPS4 was @NUM2 1/@NUM2 when the adventure started. @CAPS4 will always be in the fridge, while @CAPS8 will be in an egg carton and double check for anyone around. Then @CAPS4 would grab one and throw it and say, "@CAPS5, chicken?" With a baby accent, so cute! But @CAPS4 will try one after another until all the eggs are splattered. @CAPS4 ran away knowing we were going to get close to him and hide. I must admit at first I had no idea who was doing all this. I kind of thought it was @CAPS1.C, but not so sure. It's just a prank. @CAPS4 loves this aquarium there too, very bright as it seems to attract him. @CAPS4 will get closer and @CAPS8 will get closer. Watch them swim, all the different nice colors. Stones and small toys seemed to attract him more. When @CAPS5 someone @CAPS4'd around @CAPS8 above the tank and very carefully put his hand in and said "@CAPS7!" tried to catch it, but @CAPS5 succeeded. @CAPS4 will run so fast when he hears someone is approaching or approaching him like the bird cartoon from the madman cartoon is always out there stinging the coyote. Of course it will be messy. Although everyone knows that once @CAPS4 starts walking, @CAPS4 will be in trouble! But @CAPS4 is too cute. Now when @CAPS4 is between @NUM4 and @NUM5 years old, @CAPS4 just picks people for fun, or so we think. @CAPS4 does it for attention, so we'll drop what we're doing and go after him. What @CAPS4 does is grab something of value to someone and go up to them and say, "@CAPS8! I have it, I have it." Of course we have to go after him, but sometimes you' I have to be careful , because if it wasn't for @CAPS4, I'd be tossing if and wham! It will brake. I've only pointed out a few things here, but there's actually more, which is exciting, and then might explain it! Age @NUM5 is a workout! One day we decided to entertain @CAPS1.C by lending him our @CAPS10 touch because we were busy doing our own thing and @CAPS1.C found you! @CAPS4 loves this show called @CAPS12 and @CAPS13! In other words, @CAPS4 calls it "@CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS16." @CAPS17 @CAPS4 will continue to watch most TV shows and use apps on the @CAPS10 touchscreen! If I add in @MONTH1, @CAPS4 is very smart about using electronics. The day after that, @CAPS4 asked @CAPS10 to touch almost frequently, and then every time @CAPS4 was denied access to it, @CAPS4 used his method to get it! Of course what @CAPS4 does is when the lights go out and everyone falls asleep @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 finally @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 grab them under the pillow and carry them around. We were chasing him the next morning! @CAPS4 told us, but @CAPS4 will do it again! Then we took drastic measures to hide the @CAPS10 touch elsewhere. Now @NUM1 years old! Wow, I think @CAPS5 I think @CAPS4 has calmed down a bit. Other @MONTH1s don't think so, but I know! Anyway @CAPS4 is now @NUM1 which means @CAPS4 is starting school now! I've heard it's fun for those who aren't involved! They love @CAPS1.C, but sometimes @CAPS4 can be a bit too much, ha. @CAPS4 loves to roam around doing what @CAPS4 loves to do and just have fun , which I admire. Well, if I were to tell a little story about him as a @NUM1 year old, I would choose, what does @CAPS5 have to do with @CAPS4 always defending his bro! @CAPS4 won't let @CAPS5 bully his bros, @CAPS5 doesn't care! What I admire most about him is!
Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It can be funny or mocking. Today, many people make jokes or funny remarks just to hear someone laugh. This is by no means something we should take for granted. Through many relationships, of any kind, I believe laughter occupies at least the @PERCENT1 of your relationship. This is to bring out the best in someone and let them know you're listening. There are many other reasons in this world for laughter. "I'm sure you can even think of one". In my view of the world and today's society, I believe that laughter is what constitutes our "human" spirit. This is to show our inner spark to ourselves and others. Have you ever sat down and thought about why we make each other laugh? I ask myself the same question over and over again. For me, making people laugh is to show them that I care and to make them think I'm funny. We even just want people to like us more and be seen as funny, hilarious, or just a nice guy to talk to. Sometimes we go to extremes, be funny, and feel guilty for provoking someone in ridiculous ways. I remember when I was in eighth grade, I was thirteen. I'm really shy and don't have many friends. One day in class, some popular kids actually came up and talked to me. @CAPS1 Excited and nervous because the other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and joking and didn't care what other people were saying. Then the girl starts talking about other people like she knows everything. When she started talking about my best friend, I was both angry and happy because some of what she said was true. That's when I screwed up and I started talking about all the other stupid things she did just to make other people laugh. I just felt guilty and disappointed in myself as I sat there. I can't believe I'm sitting there talking about my best friend just to make myself popular. Later that day, she came to me really upset and didn't understand why I was doing this to her. I told her I was sorry, I did it just to make myself popular and make the other kids look funny. We haven't spoken for almost two weeks. @CAPS1 I tried to do everything I could to get my best friend back. It did take me a while but she finally came and forgave me. This is a great life lesson for me, knowing that @MONTH1's laughs aren't always a good thing. My friend and I are both juniors in high school now, when we think back to that day. We can both laugh together. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can cheer someone up and destroy them. I have experienced these things in my lifetime. Laughter makes me stronger and a better person, even if it means rejecting popular kids @CAPS1, you don't hurt those closest to you. "@CAPS1 went out today and made people laugh".
Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh every day. People without laughter are different, and the world is different. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to take our @CAPS2 writing test. Most of the class is complaining about having to write this. I was mad because I had passed the paper and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account. After a few minutes, my computer finally loaded and I could log into @CAPS2. Once there, I logged in and my computer froze. I noticed that some of the other students' computers also crashed. I laugh at them because their computer is frozen, they laugh at me because my computer is frozen. After a few minutes, my account was finally logged in and I selected Thesis. After a few minutes of my computer being frozen, I got an error message that logged me out of @CAPS2. Other classmates from @MONTH1 have also encountered this situation, I laughed because my classmate's computer is still dead and the screen is white. I log back in and it freezes for a while. I tried logging in again but kept getting a different error. I've noticed that many of my other classmates are getting these error messages too, or their computers are still freezing. After a few tries, my tests finally loaded and I could start testing. After a brief discussion, my teacher took the class offline because only a few members were able to pass the exam. Then I log out and back in @CAPS2. My computer started logging me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This also happened to many other students who took the test. After trying to log in, the furthest I can get is waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said he approved me multiple times and nothing worked. After a few minutes my computer wouldn't let me take the test, I logged out of my account and reopened it. At this point, I laughed because it worked before, but I can't get back into my tests. So far, more than half of the time has passed. No one, not even @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people started their tests. Tried a few more times, still couldn't do anything, and the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computer and wait another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to be a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, I was laughing most of the time. Although my dissertation was not finished, it was a good lesson. It was a great experience and I am sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time.
Laughter is something everyone needs in life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need laughter, smiles and a sense of humor to live a full life. When people see what someone else says differently, or even think a joke is too harsh, they see it the wrong way. People tell me, "You need a sense of humor, you know what?" @CAPS1, I take it too seriously. Back, when I was a sophomore, I was going through a rough time. Friends and family are increasingly estranged. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say it's hard to make a simple joke during the first four or five months of your sophomore year. Once, sophomore year was coming to an end, I realized there was more @CAPS1 in my life sulking in my own self-pity. It's almost @DATE1 vacation, I know I want to do @DATE1, my junior year, my year, and no one's going to ruin it for me. After all the sadness and no fun, after my dad made jokes about me, I knew I needed to hang out with him more. We laugh more @CAPS1 when my dad and I hang out, I don't even remember having. It was a really good memory. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem got better @CAPS1, it used to be. I am very satisfied that I only tried it once and my relationship with my dad is better now. Life has been going well for me so far. I've realized that I'm happier when I recognize myself and tell people the truth about me. I have to say, I've never laughed and never laughed as much as I used to. The truth about me is that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't get any therapy, I just knew that was the real me and that's probably why I was so sad in my sophomore year. As I found myself, I knew there was a lot more to do for @CAPS1 to get a better reputation. I was able to smile more and thank everyone who wanted to be my friend and even know more about me. It's really nice to know that people want to be more interested in me and ask me who I want to be called and what is transgender. I felt needed, fun, safe, and most importantly; happy. I knew I was going to get more harassment when I came out. I get a lot of calls from restricted numbers and I laugh at all the people who send me nasty emails, calls and texts. It's really a laugh because I know what I'm talking about and they don't know anything about trans people or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I've had a hot @DATE1 and it's time for school. I'm so excited about the start of it and even more excited about the movement in front of me. I know I'll kick ass in my junior year and don't let anyone get in the way of it. Around my birthday, like a month into school, I realized I needed someone to be there all the time to keep me laughing. Not that I'm not smiling or laughing, I just know I need it more in my life. A girl started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She's really cute, her character suits her so well and she already knows how to make me smile so much that my cheeks are going to end up hot. Her name is @PERSON2 and that suits her too, everything about her is great. We ended up on the phone at twelve o'clock @TIME1 on my birthday. It was by far the best night of my time and the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in @LOCATION1 that weekend. As we headed there, her friend @PERSON1 was singing @CAPS5 while @PERSON2 laughed at her creaking voice. I've never laughed so hard that my stomach shudders. So, you see, it's a really wonderful feeling to have a lot of people out there making you laugh. You even had to laugh at yourself for how stupid you sounded. Meeting new people is the perfect feeling, especially when they melt your heart and make you feel like a duck every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 smile.
In a relationship, you should be able to trust each other, talk to each other, talk to each other, cry each other, and most importantly laugh each other. Many people think that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I definitely agree with that statement. The most laughable relationship of my life was between me and my best friend and boyfriend @PERSON2. He always makes me laugh, even on my worst days, he can find smiles and giggles. I am always grateful to @CAPS1 for letting him into my life. When I started getting to know @PERSON2 better, the first thing I really noticed was that he always made me laugh. Whether he made totally weird looks at me or tickled me until I could barely breathe, he always knew how to make me laugh. Even then he made me giggle when I stared at him. Just at @TIME1, I had a bad day at school and within minutes of crying to him he cheered me up and made me laugh. In church or with friends, we just look at each other, make faces and start laughing, those blue eyes and goofy smiles always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh at each other has been an important aspect of our relationship from the very beginning. We always laugh at how badly I play when we play @CAPS2, or when he plays and I try and fail, or when I end up with a great kill. "That's it, doesn't it!" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny, but we're happy with who we say the most in a day. The rule is you have to say it with a good reason, and if we say it at the same time, we always jokingly argue about who won or got the "point" (as if we actually kept the score) but this usually makes us laugh among us of some stupid excuse or reasoning that a person is trying to use. When @PERSON2 has cameras around, he likes to make faces and it always makes me laugh. And then we usually end up taking about twenty silly pictures and going through them and laughing and laughing at all the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing, usually the other laughs too, and they do say that laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable and get along, you have to be able to laugh at yourself. At one point, @PERSON2 his sisters, @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 and I saw how high we could kick, long story short, I knelt on my forehead, @PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard my bones crack Hit each other hard and he just kept silent until I started to break down. Then he made sure I was fine. We laughed so hard and cried, I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were flushed with embarrassment, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were hanging out on the hardwood floors of his house and I pushed him to the ground and his whole family was falling apart and his face was flushed but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other, we have the ability to laugh it off. Even when the going gets tough and we you disagree on something, it's always good to be able to look back on it later and have a good laugh at each other. Just because @PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, in fact we disagree on a lot of things, but most things are small, but occasionally we're on bigger things There are differences. Sometimes one of us will do or say something that upsets the other, and we're always able to fix it before looking back at it and laughing, even if it's a touchy subject. We've both made mistakes in the past too, but again we look back and laugh. Apparently I also have reason to agree with the statement "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" because I made that connection in the best possible way. I am so grateful to have @PERSON2 in my life, his laugh and ability to make me laugh is what made me fall in love with him in the first place. So in between yelling at each other over texting "@CAPS3", doing weird things to us, or just watching a movie, we're always laughing at each other or laughing at each other. As we both said, "What a soul mate!"
Every day I spend with my girlfriend is a day of fun and laughter. I'm probably in the worst mood and she could light up my day with a few words from @CAPS1. Together we can turn any situation into a happy one. What I'm trying to say is that laughter is a very powerful thing @CAPS1 and by making someone laugh you can change their mood, their day, or in some cases their entire life. People say laughter is contagious. I believe this is true. Take comedians, who can handle any situation and make the whole room burst into laughter. My favorite is when the comedian says "@CAPS2 @CAPS3 shivering in the cold and we'll bring him gold and silver", like this song. Then he said "@CAPS4 they @CAPS1 don't get him some blankets, I'm coming, this poor kid will die of hypothermia, but at least he'll be rich when he does". I wrote this paper to demonstrate the power of laughter in the world. I believe everyone should laugh at least once a day and make the world a better place. I conclude with "a smile brightens a room, and a smile makes the world a happier place." No one should live their life without laughter. "A life without laughter is a life without life."
In Laughter is a true story for me. My favorite laughter memory happened two years ago @CAPS4 I met my friend @CAPS1. I met her at @ORGANIZATION1. I came out of @CAPS4 from @ORGANIZATION5, and @CAPS1 came in. We bumped into each other. First, we were both angry with each other and just said, "@CAPS3 watch where you're going!" @CAPS4 We both calmed down and we parted ways. I went to the food court and she was there less than ten minutes behind me. We are all waiting in line at @ORGANIZATION3. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for a while until I apologized for meeting her earlier. She said, "@CAPS5 and @CAPS6, I should have been looking at where I was going, not the floor, when I was walking." We laughed for a while until it was our turn to eat. After paying, I asked her if she would like to sit with me since we were all alone at the time. The reason we're alone is because both of our parents are doing more shopping. We started talking about where we came from and what school we went to. @CAPS1 goes to private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We are both in our freshman year at @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both love the band. @CAPS1 and I just noticed we met once before at a band competition. We met in the same way at least a year ago, and then again. As she walked out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was about to cross the room to the room where my band was warming up under two doors. I'm just walking, like @CAPS1 is just walking in @ORGANIZATION1, looking at the floor as I go. Also, we both get angry with each other. We both just laughed for a while, just laughing at how we were doing the same thing, but opposite each other before. We've all changed a lot and we all know we'll be great friends. I want to laugh with someone and you can tell if you are good friends. Laughter is the big thing in friendship. I mean what's the point of having a friend @CAPS4, you don't even laugh every now and then and have great memories of each other. To this day I still hang out with @CAPS1 and we still can't believe we'll meet the same way twice.
Laughter is a very important part of life for many different reasons. Some @MONTH1 say survival is crucial and one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter hurts more than it helps. This is a statement that I believe in myself and is a conclusion drawn from the actions and results of my life. Laughter can show emotion for the statement, or lack thereof. Laughing can be frustrating or happy. When someone says someone is laughing at you and someone is laughing with you, it's true. It's an amazing, self-esteem-boosting emotion when a friend or group of friends laughs with me. This kind of laughter brings friends closer and makes us trust each other more. There was one time when I thought it was appropriate to laugh, but then I felt bad. One hot @DATE1 day, my friends and I decided to venture out to the mall as we live in an apartment and don't have the money for an air conditioner. We all agree it's a brilliant idea. When we arrived at the mall, the door opened and the cool breeze was so relieved that it seemed to greet us. We're all very introverted, so walking around in an overcrowded mall is not our cup of tea. Not sure what @CAPS1 would do, we sat on the bench and did what we called what people were watching. They were the girl and I will always remember her; @CAPS4 is one of those girls you stare at for a minute, you know @CAPS4 is rich. A little cocky girl, @CAPS4 means exaggerating her hips and bouncing her perfectly bleached blonde hair. The girl passed us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were simply not good enough to be in front of her. After @CAPS4 walked by and laughed at her strutting, I got up and got a little pissed. My friends thought it was hysterical. Laughter jumped out of their mouths. The stressed girl stopped and started approaching us. @CAPS4 grimaced at us like a snob and said, "@CAPS1 Do you guys like having questions?" @CAPS2 covered my face, I don't know what to say. Luckily, my best friend stepped in and said, "@CAPS3, we think your dress is beautiful." @CAPS4 believed us and walked away in a less snobby fashion. My friends and I have learned a lot through this strange and interesting experience. One, people can hear you talking about their crap from a mile away. 2. Laughter can bring friends together, but it also has consequences. I @CAPS1 not sure if @CAPS4 heard or saw us laughing at her. But I know I feel a little bad inside. Of course it was right to laugh at her at that point, it was funny. Looking back, I feel bad. I've been in the same situation, but on the receiving end. Having someone speak ill of you behind your back and laugh uncontrollably is not a pleasant thing. Laughter is very important to life, but needs to be appropriate.
DAIRY @CAPS1 Boyfriend and I spend a lot of time hanging out together, @CAPS2 @PERSON3 I just had a fight two days ago. His mother just finished cooking the food. He wanted me to try it and see if I liked it. But before I eat any @CAPS3, is he willing to eat some with me. "Maybe just a little," he said, getting up and picking up his fork. I thought he was going to eat with me but it turned out he just sat next to me talking to @PERSON2 @CAPS2 about the fight he just got into. I really don't mind the fact that he didn't eat with me. I keep eating, I separate the food by color and make a face on my plate. It turned out great and he looked at it and said "what was that supposed to be?" with a smirk on his face "it's a face!  … seeing carrots for the nose, shrimp for the eyes, vegetables and , the noodles form the mouth and hair" I smiled and looked up "Want to take a picture of my face on the plate?" I said "no" and he replied "@CAPS4" I replied I mixed everything up again and when I was done Continuing to eat my food I get up, put the plate in the sink, go back to the table and sit down. @PERSON3 got up and walked outside, brought more wood to the fireplace and started lighting it. I went up and asked him if he was angry and he said yes and now I am sad. I said sorry, we talked it over and he got mad because I didn't ask him to take a picture of my food. Five minutes later happy again @PERSON1 suggested we go to @CAPS5 and we all agreed. When we got them, we all ordered our food and waited. "Let's go to the wrestling mat!?" We both said at the exact time that @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 have been waiting for orders, while @PERSON3 and I are going to play mini-game kids toys. We were sprinting to the wrestling mat when we found all the little kids staring at us like they'd never seen older kids play. We continued our little game of kicking, hitting, slapping and grabbing each other. I decided I needed a break, so I sat up and took a deep breath. Oh, getting dressed, I heard strange noises and I looked back and asked if he farted yes. Farting continued, but the room seemed too quiet and we looked around and found that all the little boys and girls heard him too! They are the little girl standing at the entrance, a little boy a few feet away from @PERSON3 and two other kids by the slide. I guess they were shocked, I started laughing to tears and ran out of the game room to tell @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 what just happened and they thought it was funny too.
@CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is a powerful tool when you know how to use it. It has the power to inspire when in doubt. Lifting a heavy spirit to new heights, it can also create great devotion to a person, thing or cause. So what does laughter do for you and me? Well, it has done a lot for me, a good example is my experience at @ORGANIZATION2. In the middle of @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION3, everything is in order for me. I have good grades, teachers, but most importantly a group of friends with whom I can share a lot of laughs. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION3, my friends either moved or dispersed to other groups. It's so scary that there's no one to laugh with and it makes things really tough. Then the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program or @ORGANIZATION1. Since I wasn't really involved in the project, I don't have any friends except vanecek. Then the opportunity for it to join @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 came and I took it. Every afternoon we have an hour of practice, which in turn builds strong bonds among @ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting, we would laugh and relax and make it a fun shooting environment. @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, for hearing all the laughter out of range. @ORGANIZATION2 is part of my camp and runs five competitions a year. With 14 schools from @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I'm super nervous. We've been together long enough to think about another family before our first game. My family saw how nervous I was and pulled me aside the night before the shootout. We played cards, chatted, joked and it was one of the most special moments of my life. We shot the next morning, and I wasn't nervous, just relaxed. In a team of 24 we finished third, not bad for a new family. Since then, @ORGANIZATION4 has won four consecutive No. 1s. I must attribute these victories to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter somehow inspired my devotion to family and took me to new heights. I guess my question is, @CAPS4 @CAPS1 which member are you?
Seeing one of @CAPS15's best friends traveling and bumping his face on the screen door is enough to make me laugh. It's @DATE1 after @CAPS15 @NUM1 grade. I have @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and @CAPS15's neighbor @PERSON1 spending the night at @CAPS15's house. When @CAPS25 is bored, we usually have some fun by wandering around some houses in the @CAPS15 community "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3". "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3" is @CAPS25 @CAPS21 sneaked up to someone's front door, rang the doorbell a few times, and @CAPS23 ran away. All four of us went out to play that day. It was a great @DATE1 day with bright sunshine, warm temperatures and a cool breeze to cool your face. @CAPS25 Come nightfall and we are all playing @CAPS7 @NUM2 in the @CAPS15 room. "I'm bored bro," @PERSON2 said to the three of us. "So @CAPS8, think of something for @CAPS19," @CAPS9 replied, "I can't think of anything," @PERSON1 said with a bored face. We sat for a while thinking of @CAPS19 to entertain the four of us. "I got it!" I said with a confident smirk, "Let's go @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!" "I'm so frustrated with this," @PERSON2 said "@CAPS13 Me too," @CAPS9 and @PERSON1 Reply shortly after @PERSON2. As we walked out the front door of @CAPS15, @CAPS15 mom yelled, "Where is the @CAPS21 boy going?" @CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I don't know what to say, "Well, we're going for a walk," I replied hesitantly. "@CAPS16 is safe," @CAPS15 mom said as I walked out the door. We @CAPS1 @CAPS2 abandoned a couple's house but it started to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I could think of. "@CAPS18 this is what needs to happen, I'm going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 the first house, @PERSON2 @CAPS21 to the next, @PERSON1 @CAPS21 to the house around the corner, @PERSON3 will run around" @ CAPS19 @CAPS21 think this will work? "@PERSON1 asked. "@CAPS20 Yes, it works!" "I said, "@CAPS21 @CAPS18 are you ready?" " I think so," @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 as we all stood in line. I rang the first doorbell and started running, then I saw @PERSON2 use his clenched Fist slams the second door, then I don't see @PERSON1 ring the door because he's already running ahead of me. "@CAPS9 GET THE FINAL HOUSE! "I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 ran to didn't turn on their porch lights. @CAPS9 ran quickly to the house without seeing the steps in front of the door. Didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped on the steps , slammed his face against the screen door. I could hear a thud in the middle of the dark street. He got up quickly and turned to us in confusion, "Should I ring the doorbell? Should I ring the doorbell? " @CAPS23 running @CAPS9 I'm sure they'll hear @CAPS21 knock your face on their screen door!" " @CAPS25 We went home to @CAPS15 and everyone was laughing. @CAPS9 @CAPS23 had our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time when When a friend of yours asks @CAPS21 to "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28", think to see if the porch light is on.
"@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my wallet is?" I want to know where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it under all the dirty laundry in my room. I'm relieved, I'm glad I found it before it happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and thought it was just another day. I plan to go to a basketball game after school. This is the biggest game of the season and we are playing our opponents @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It's been a slow day, but I can't wait for it to end. Finally the bell rang, school was over, and I drove home a little disappointed. I'm not sure if my friends will go to the game with me, and if they don't, I probably won't either. I made up my mind though, and I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2. It was my usual day that turned into one of the most eventful days ever. @ORGANIZATION1 (where the race takes place) is about 20 minutes away and I had to stop to refuel before we left. We went to the cheapest place in town to fill up my car. When it came time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car that doesn't keep starting, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. In the other lane there were some of our new people staring at us. We just started laughing and it was really embarrassing. The waiter asked if we needed anything else and I said no, my car just didn't start. I tried turning it on again, but it keeps freezing. On all other days, my car decided not to start today. Then some people came out and told me they had to move my car away and I was embarrassed and started laughing again. I always laugh when I'm nervous. I told them to let me try to open my car again and I prayed my car would open this time. Indeed, I was both relieved and so embarrassed that I left as soon as possible. 20 minutes later we were at @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, again by my luck there was no parking. We drove for about five minutes until we found a walking distance. Then we packed up and headed to the race. It hasn't started yet, but it's about to start and I have a feeling it's going to be a very close race. Soon the game started, as I thought, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting, but the two parents behind us really enjoyed the game. They kept yelling at the players, yelling at the referees, it was just annoying. The game was good, but in the end @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won with @CAPS6 points. It's a bit disappointing, but @ORGANIZATION1 does have a great team. After the game, we're going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after the game so that we wouldn't be stuck in the road. I was driving on this road and I thought I was a novice, but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to move on to her new job. I've been on the road and luckily @CAPS7 brought us downtown. I took one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. However, the road I'm on has a million stop lights, and I stop every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the road in front of me and I waited for him to cross the road even though he wasn't even on the crosswalk. I have no worries, the music explodes and suddenly a rainbow lights up behind me. The day couldn't have been worse, I stopped and waited for @CAPS8 to come to my window. He wants my license and registration. I picked up my wallet and looked at my wallet. My heart is pounding, where is the driver's license I just put in my wallet a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves are out of my control. I looked around and at the end he asked me if I had my student ID and I went and took it out, my driver's license is down there. He got back to his car and left me laughing. He came back and told me my insurance had expired, which made me so happy. I was still laughing when he gave me tickets for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was joking. You can't control your nerves, at least I can't.
In my opinion, laughter is the key to any happy and successful relationship. It can break the ice in an awkward situation, or help you get closer to someone. Some people say that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and laughter is the best medicine. I believe both statements are correct. My personal laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations in my @NUM1 years of life. I remember one time in particular where laughter really brought me closer to other people was when I was camping with a few friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We've been talking about very serious things, family and friends issues, and just sharing our difficulties with each other. I really have nothing to complain about, I have a very ordinary family and I love them with good friends. However, I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friend's family life that night. She started talking about how her parents didn't care and how they were both alcoholics, and I could see in her tone how painful it was for her to admit that information. The atmosphere suddenly changed from discussing light-hearted questions to serious, emotional conversation. She went on to tell me how lonely she felt at times and that she always wished she could be with her friends because we always had a lot of fun. After she told me all this, we lay in silence for a while. Neither of us fell asleep, but I didn't know what to say. I mean, how can anything I say improve the situation or help her feel better. While we were having this conversation, another friend of ours was already running back to the car to get a soda and go to the bathroom. We hear her say our names and seek us out in the dark. Suddenly she knew where we were, and she tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag and fell on top of us, spilling a bunch of bubbly grape soda in our faces. Usually we get mad, but we all think it's hysterical. I looked at my friend when I was laughing like a madman, she just told me her painful story, and now she's crying for laughing so hard, I know a little bit of laughter brings us closer. It was a memory I will never forget, and it was an experience where I felt that laughter played an important role in making a relationship more comfortable and intimate. Similar experiences have happened in my life. Laughter is a common denominator and all people can relate to. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you're laughing legally, you're so addicted to it that you forget everything else. All your problems are gone.
Laughter Laughter has always played an important role in the relationships of @CAPS2 life. Being able to laugh with someone creates a bond with that person. Through laughter, I was able to befriend someone I can still call @CAPS2's best friend to this day. I met someone who would become @CAPS2's best friend through a friend of @CAPS2. I was hanging out with a few friends of mine, and @PERSON1, a friend of @CAPS2, said, "@CAPS1 knows about @PERSON2, @CAPS1 should talk to a good friend of mine." I don't have @CAPS4 against the idea, because from @PERSON1 Tell me about her, and I seem to get along easily with her. About ten minutes later, I looked down at @CAPS2's phone and saw that I had received a text message from a number I didn't recognize. I asked who this person was and waited for an answer. Two minutes passed and I got a message that said "@CAPS2's name is @ORGANIZATION2. I'm the girl with the curly hair sitting next to @CAPS1 telling @CAPS1." Once I read this, I began to laugh. I never thought a girl I'd never talked to would be brave enough, or sarcastic enough, to say something like that as the first thing they said to me. Over the next few hours, we exchanged sarcastic remarks and jokes and laughed. @ORGANIZATION2 is the kind of guy who can make anyone laugh. That's what I love about her; @CAPS3 has the gift of making anyone laugh, no matter where they are, what mood they're in or what they're doing. We had been walking for hours and most of the time had to stop to catch our breath because we laughed so hard. Our ability to laugh at each other helps us get through difficult times in our lives. @ORGANIZATION2's mom passed away a few years ago, which sent her into a state of depression. @CAPS3 Rarely feel any joy until we talk. Our ability to start laughing at each other helped her during this time. I recently received @CAPS4.BI or @ORGANIZATION1. I am numb to the world. Nothing feels like it used to feel. Luckily for me, @ORGANIZATION2 was able to come in and do what I did for her; @CAPS3 was able to make me laugh and feel normal again. The ability to laugh with @ORGANIZATION2 has certainly made our friendship stronger than when we couldn't. Being able to laugh' @CAPS4 only affects the moment, not a person. Laughter is much more than that. Being able to laugh creates connections that are simply impossible without laughter. I've felt the effects of laughter on a relationship and I can say it definitely feels good.
"@CAPS1!" @CAPS2 Today's society loves laughter. From comedy shows to hilarious friends, people are having fun. Not to mention that when you double your laugh, you get an amazing workout. Everyone texting @MONTH1 uses "@CAPS3" or "haha" to mean they think something is funny; but that's nothing compared to actually being with friends and having a "booming smile." I can not wait anymore. My friends and I were in a camp on the coast and we were about to look up towards the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. As we walked out the door one of the girls tripped and we had to laugh. Because she barely caught herself when she tripped because she was about to fall asleep @CAPS4. Jasmine hurried out the door with us. After closing the door, we all burst into laughter. Jasmine's face when she stumbles is priceless. We walked into the fresh air without looking back. From the gravel road to the cement road up the hill, we happily skipped it. As the mountain got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine was so tired from dancing that she almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. It took longer than expected to go up the mountain. Finally, we can see the three crosses at the top. When we reach the cross, we wait for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the sea; waiting expectantly. Finally, @CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises in the east and we will be over mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun was on. Finally, the amazing sunrise happened. It's full of pinks, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise, we realized we still had a dangerous walk down the mountain. I stared at the edge and saw a path. With a bunch of persuasion, I let all the girls go down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up. The first part of the path is simple. It gets thinner with more brushes as we start going further down the hill. A few girls thought we should go back, but I persuaded them. So we went. "@CAPS6 NO!" @CAPS7 shouted. We turn around to see that she managed to get her shoes to fall into the blackberry bushes. She had just got the shoes the day before, and now they're muddy and lost. Everyone wants to go, but the distance is too far. Suddenly, @PERSON1 tries to grab the shoe; she immediately falls into the blackberry bush! @PERSON2 forgot her shoes and started rolling over again laughing. While waving and screaming, we yelled at her to stop because if I hadn't mentioned this before; it was a very steep hill. She grabbed @PERSON2's shoes while she was in the bushes. The hardest part was getting @PERSON1 out. The first time we tried to pull her up; we helped her up a few inches before she fell back into the bushes. Finally, after a million tries, we pulled her big ass out of the bushes. During the event, everyone had a good laugh. @PERSON1 Very embarrassing. After that, we went down the mountain. We still giggled as we trot along the trail. When we went, we saw animal tracks. Then we realized that the trail was most likely made by animals. Several girls joked about being afraid of animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing at what happened. For the rest of the day, everyone woke up happy and smirking on a wonderful morning. Laughter helped the girls have a great day. The laughter helped us through the mud, shoes and cold. Without it, we could be very grumpy. Also, having great friends to laugh with is amazing. Laughter can make people happy; happiness is better than sadness; therefore, laughter is important. In writing this paper to @ORGANIZATION1 at @LOCATION1, I told my friends about the adventures we've had and the trouble we've gotten into. They laughed hysterically because they knew the girls. Laughing often is for happiness.
"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those good times come to an end on @DATE1 and all to come. Some people think it's weird, but if you know us, you'll understand. Sometimes people say, "I'm dying laughing." @CAPS2 I know I'm because of @PERSON1, she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we laughed together or finished together, I probably didn't have enough time or numbers to tell you how many times. First of all, this friendship started with @DATE1 and now we are in our sophomore year @DATE1. We have been friends @DATE1 and 11 months and 6 days. we are best friends. So last time @DATE1, when we were learning football season cheers, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I would say, "@CAPS3-in @CAPS4" every time we finished cheering. This is what we say, we always do it after @DATE1 and football or basketball games. We call it the @CAPS3-in @CAPS4 style or simply our catchphrase. We would have fun and laugh for hours. "@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn," on @DATE2 as we prepare to cheer. On the drive to @LOCATION1, every time we turn a corner, we say what corner it is and make an action with it. Oh @CAPS1 gosh we laughed and we had a great time. After the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 turns, there is another move we call monkey, where we act like a monkey. We had a good laugh. We also laughed so hard that we all cried and we had to go to pee, which was almost terribly bad. That was one of many amazing car tours. On the other hand, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 cheered with me, we had a sleepover, @CAPS2 I should have said we did everything together. She is @CAPS1's cheering sister, always will be, and @CAPS1's best friend. I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1 @PERSON1. Also, we do everything together. When @PERSON1 ends up at @CAPS1's house, I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so I made all of this and @PERSON1 loved it so now I have to make sure I have some for her when she comes over. Now we're always talking about sandwich habit formation. b We keep laughing. Finally, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I will always be together because I don't know what I would do without my @CAPS1 sister. Without her, I wouldn't be who I am today, she and everything I am, we laugh even if we want to cry, she is everything to me. You could say we have a perfect friendship. @CAPS1's best friend is @CAPS1 sister I love you @PERSON1, thanks @CAPS1 for coming back.
It was a day on @DATE1 and I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 walks with me because we both live on the same street. He lives far away from me, but we always walk to and from school together. Well, on this special day, I decided to wear a pair of sneakers with a sole that has no traction at all, and it's snowing outside. I slipped a few times but never fell. We laughed because I was about to say something and I nearly fell. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it and I joined. It was funny because even at school I almost fell because the floor got wet from dry snow. I thought about just walking home to change my shoes, but I had to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or I'd be in trouble. After the first class, I found a puddle of water and started sliding over it for fun. My friends have tried this too, but their shoes have too much traction on it. The bell rang for the start of the second class, and I went to class. Going to class is fun because I wander around. As soon as I entered the classroom, the teacher told me where to go for a field trip to the pond. I was about to skip it, but the teacher walked right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading to the pond. My teacher called out our names to make sure we were all there. He has to do it approximately every @NUM1 minutes. It's annoying. The bus driver was also playing country music, and I didn't mind country music, but I really didn't want to listen to it that day. I took my ipod out of my pocket and found it wasn't there. I forgot it at home while rushing to school. We finally got to the pond and we unloaded the bus to start our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go near the pond because if we fell into the water we would get wet and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just swearing and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me that if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry so we wouldn't get the seats wet. Again I think it's a bunch of bulls. We met our guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they were used for. While walking around the pond, I started sliding on the ground. I grabbed my friend so I wouldn't fall, but his balance was so bad that we both fell. Everyone started laughing, myself too. My friend didn't think it was too much fun at first. But as soon as he got up he started laughing and joking about how I couldn't stand still. On the way back to school, we talked about what we've learned and if we'd like to go back and learn more, or even volunteer to work at the pond. I thought it would be fun if I didn't keep slipping. We unloaded the bus again and walked towards the school. I found that the little puddle I had found earlier wasn't drying up and I started running and sliding through it. I didn't fall this time. The bus took us back in time for the last class of the day, unfortunately for me @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to play. He told me we were going upstairs to play dodgeball on the wrestling mat. The wrestling mat upstairs is a small area, we would only go there if we had a small class. I was lucky because we had to take our shoes off when we played on the mat. I finished @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I put on my normal clothes and went home. My friend @PERSON1 is waiting for me outside. We started going home and I was slipping back and forth with every step I took. The sun melts the top layer of snow, turning it into ice. I looked at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He also laughed. I've been skating on the ice on the way home. It's been a really fun day. Except when I got home, I fell on the deck because the steps were icy.
It was one of those days when I was sitting around doing nothing all day, just playing @PERSON2, texting and laughing at myself. It was one of those days when no one bothered me. No one actually spoke to me; no one told me to do housework. When it was dinner time, someone decided to call me upstairs for dinner, but I'm telling you, it's nothing like pizza. Although I'd rather eat it than take a speech about ingratitude. My brother came home for the first time ever, ate with us and decided to leave again. But this time I'm asking to come along; I'm tired of beating @PERSON2. He said no, rough. I asked my dad to change his mind for him, rude. I don't understand why he wouldn't let me in in the first place. He was going to hang out with the people I grew up with, my friends, not his. anyway. I'm ready, and we're on our way. He was there with me, on the way to pick up my friends, laughing over dinner and what kind of music my mom was listening to. These guys are amazing! All we did was joke around with each other and break up. But let's get down to business. I didn't tell you this, but this is @DATE1 time, around @CAPS1 on @DATE2. Fireworks are being sold and we are making "bombs" with them. Or they are. Since I'm a girl, I guess I'm not allowed, or something crappy like that. But there is a girl my brother likes and I think he wants to impress her, please forgive me for coming to her house to "impress her" so she can see these "masterpieces" they make. That just made me feel bad for him, but honestly just made me laugh. Maybe she will be moved. Keywords: maybe. Although, no, it won't. Because to this day, they are still just friends. So about these bombs. A complete dud. We tried, well, I just watched, and made them work over and over, but they didn't do anything. Finally my friend @CAPS2 put a bunch of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 into my favorite plush toy. It just made a bunch of shimmering colors and a lot of noise, but it was fun to watch. We also participated in the video, which was a good laugh for everyone. After my brother said goodbye to his "girl" we decided to go home. Problem is, we still have so many fireworks left! We know this kid @PERSON3 who lives somewhere on the way home. So we decided to go to his house, get @CAPS2 out of the car, set off fireworks on his porch, have him jump to the back of the trunk, and drive away as fast as we can. The first time we did this, we couldn't stop laughing. They didn't come out of their house so we did it again. They still didn't come out. We did it again and all the neighbors were out then. They were all very confused. It made us laugh even more. Great, we want to keep doing this, but this time for someone else. We know this girl @PERSON1 who lives near us. We thought, why not? It wouldn't hurt to stop quickly to play with her either. Apparently she thought differently. Totally different, actually she thought it was the rudest thing ever. We were just kidding and laughing out of all our fun. We are not rude, she is our friend. Long story short, her mom got mad too and chased us with her car. She never caught us, but she got our license plate number. The next day, on @CAPS1 on @DATE2, she called the police. They didn't think it was a big deal, but they still showed up at my house and talked to my parents about what happened. I was lucky with my boyfriend, I just had to talk to my mom on the phone. She realized we were just having a good time and actually laughed too. @CAPS1 from @DATE2 @CAPS8 is great. It was a night where you laughed all the time, and even breaking the law for it wouldn't change anything. Something I'll definitely never do again, but I'm glad I have this hilarious memory to reminisce for the rest of my life.
Day by day with my family, my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and I went out for breakfast at @ORGANIZATION2. They both grew up together, and telling stories from the past makes them both want to hang out more often. They always have fun together @CAPS2. I often grew up with my cousins. We are always hanging out. We started talking about all the crazy times we've been through and it's great to hear about the old days. We're just laughing a storm. Suddenly out of @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON1 farted. All of us started laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart in her uncontrollable laughter. @CAPS2 A lot of people were watching us in the restaurant. Here's a bunch of people laughing, and one of them keeps farting. The laughter and farting got louder. My mom can't take it anymore. She picked up a salt shaker and started pounding on the table. She wants to drown out @LOCATION1 farting. @PERSON1 got hit. We are all laughing @CAPS2 and we are starting to cry. We almost got to the point where we had to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 can't take it anymore. She finally stopped farting, but now she has to urinate @CAPS2, bad she can't even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom, she had to walk there cross-legged, and very slowly. She was still laughing along the way, and we were laughing too. We are happy to see that she has to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she doesn't pee on herself. At one point, she stopped right on the two chairs. She just stood there, laughing cross-legged at these two guys who tried not to pee. Those guys weren't really doing anything, they were just sitting there waiting for her to leave. We can say they are uncomfortable. I told my mom "If I had a random girl bent over me laughing and trying not to pee, I would be uncomfortable. I'm surprised they didn't move. I would". Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. The two guys had left, and when she came out, she was happy to see them gone. We couldn't help but laugh when we saw her. She laughs with us @CAPS2 and we don't have a hard time laughing. People are still looking at us and @PERSON1 is still blushing. She wanted to go to @CAPS2 and we left and talked about it on the way home. They come to our house to play boring games. When we got home, my brother joined us in the gesture game. This game is a bit like sherades. We entered the team. I'm at @ORGANIZATION1 with my brother team. My brother left first. He began to melt to the ground. I shouted "Western Demon Witch"! He frowned at me and said, "@CAPS1, pay attention before you say it out loud." @CAPS2 I sat there watching. He did his whole melting thing again, but when he got to the floor, he started rolling and twitching. I am confused @CAPS2. My cousins yelled "poo"! My brother yelled "@CAPS3 why would anyone want to be a poo"! We all started laughing and he just told us what he was. He is a waterfall. It was my turn to go and I got the horse. I don't want to be a horse. I don't even know how to be a horse without sound. I went there and started wishing like an idiot. I think @CAPS2 is stupid. My teammates made me feel worse because they couldn't guess what I meant to their lives. The buzzer went off and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates losing. He got really angry and ran up the stairs. On his way up, he tripped over his face and fell down the stairs. We all started laughing, which made my brother even more angry. This time he didn't fall, went upstairs again and stayed in his room for the rest of @TIME1. The rest of us stayed downstairs and played more games. It's been a really fun day. I have to hang out with my family and laugh. Hanging out with the family is something everyone should enjoy. It's one of those things that makes you feel good.
Laughter is important, we all know it. It makes life easier, happier, and may even help you live longer. It's also important for relationships. When talking about the preferences of significant others, people often mention that they want someone who makes them laugh, and here's why. However, this story has nothing to do with dating. It's about how laughter can turn you from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next. At this point, I've known @PERSON1 for a few months, and I met him on the bus. He was pale, scrawny, had a loud voice, and he always said funny and offensive things. He is a closed person. I can get it out before I meet @PERSON1, but I can't take it. I remember the day I went from hating him to befriending him and we were fighting over something so trivial that I can't remember for the life of me what it was. Although I remember what he said. He said I was a "hypocritical, arrogant bastard who would go around making jokes about people, but if they made a joke on me, they would stand up in front of people." It made me laugh. Not because everything he said was true, but because it made me realize that @PERSON1 is actually a really nice guy and his only real problem is that he doesn't know when to shut up. The entire time I have known @PERSON1, he has never stopped smiling. He laughed it off, and he could use laughter to ease the pain of any blow, from stepping on shit to his father's drug addiction. @PERSON1 keeps reminding me not to laugh.
Laughter is good for everyone. @CAPS1 helps the body stay awake In fact, believe it or not, @CAPS1 is a workout for the body. When people are really nervous, laughter purifies the body. @CAPS1 is like healing the body, and laughing is not only good for you, but @CAPS1 it also gives another person the courage to do so when they see you.
Laughter is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 had it, I know @CAPS4 had it. We all have. @CAPS4 is that kid of a parent who doesn't want to help your nagging. Especially when your dad is in a huge motorcycle wreck and @CAPS4 has been waiting for his entire visit. @CAPS10 went through several surgeries and took a lot of medication for @CAPS2. I noticed that @CAPS10 isn't really himself on all these pills. His anomaly took a toll on the family. We are also worried about @CAPS6's stepmom during all these stressful times. She is pregnant with her second child. And the stress of @CAPS6 Dad's business is his main income and he can't work. @CAPS6 Dad feels helpless, his legs are so weak, he can't do anything. @CAPS10 will micromanage everything and tell @CAPS4 that everything is wrong. This started to cause a lot of tension in the house. Today is that day. Isabelle (@CAPS6 little sister) and I were alone with @CAPS6 and dad for the first time. I'm going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we're doing in the @CAPS6 room. Dad asked if I could make him some oatmeal, and of course I said with my hands full, "@CAPS5, but I'll do it when I'm done." @CAPS6 Dad thought it was disrespectful and limped on crutches come to me. It was frustrating for @CAPS10 to yell at me, so instead of fighting back, I went to the @CAPS6 room. The anger in his voice was unbearable. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and went back to the @CAPS6 room. That's when it happens. @CAPS6 Father hooked the end of a kid's chair and threw it down the hallway. It bounced off the wall, broke an exit casing, punched a hole in the wall, and hit @CAPS6 in the knee. I didn't speak, afraid of what would happen next. Luckily I slammed the door and I called @CAPS6 grandmother. I told her in the voicemail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. About an hour later, she showed up, unaware that I had left a voicemail. I explained what happened, she comforted @CAPS6 sister and I told us it was okay. @CAPS6 Grandma made us all sit in the living room trying to figure this out. By then @CAPS6 Dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @CAPS10 asked us to forgive him with popcorn and candy, then @CAPS10 started teasing and joking. @CAPS6 Dad always makes some jokes to put us in a good mood every time there is an argument or disagreement. The difference this time is that after @CAPS10 told some jokes, @CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why @CAPS10 is sorry. I love that it makes the rest of the day very enjoyable. "@CAPS7 makes laughter the medicine for @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @NUM1 minutes of laughter equals two hours of @CAPS2 @CAPS3." @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on @DATE1 service talked about it. Laughter can really heal a broken heart. The @CAPS2 that @CAPS6 sister and I went through that day ended after the laughter that @CAPS6 dad gave us. "Laughter can save us." @CAPS10 also pointed out. After this day, I kind of humorously believe that @CAPS6 father and my relationship can solve any problem. I will never let one mistake control the bond of a lifetime. Laughter will always be in our hearts.
Laughter plays an important role in relationships, and @CAPS1 also supports enjoyment, which can be the pursuit of happiness. Whenever I laugh, it's either because I'm really enjoying myself or just because I'm having a good time. A lot of people don't have a great sense of humour and don't laugh at funny things, whenever I watch a funny movie I like I sit and wait for the really funny part, but don't get me wrong, remember not to laugh too much Awesome because you might accidentally get your pants wet or who knows if you laugh hard enough you might even pull out a "whotammy" trust me that doesn't look pretty and then you'll be in front of everyone feel embarrassed. My favorite comedian is Adam Sandler because he's funny and has a great sense of humor, he knows how to keep a guy laughing and is interested in his comedy shows and movies. @CAPS1 was very good and funny when he made the Big Daddy movie, but @CAPS1 was good. My second favorite comedian is @PERSON1 because he's a little bit more fun than Adam Sandler but didn't give up even though he also starred in a tv show called wild'n out which really made me almost Cough out my lungs especially when they joke with your mom @CAPS1 keep you laughing and keep your body circulating. So we all know pretty well what laughter is, but most people don't seem to actually laugh at funny things I can't quit with @CAPS1, but I guess they don't have a good sense of humor, but some people seem to have a problem with those who don't even The meaning of laughing at things I quit doesn't understand either, but I think laughing is better than not laughing at all. Some really good comedy movies that I can mention right away that will keep you in tune and laughing for more than half of the movie, it's granny boys, happy Gilmore, don't pose for South Central while drinking my juice threaten. Zombieland @CAPS1 is also a good movie, I don't know it's not just about making a funny movie just to make the audience laugh @CAPS1 is the way they made @CAPS1 and how they act and how good the backstory is Comedy movies will be my focus when I sit down and check what makes this movie interesting, and if I can't understand a funny movie, I'll watch @CAPS1 over and over again until I understand @CAPS1 what's so funny. This basically covers the basics of laughter, has your basic information and what you need to know about @CAPS1 and how to enjoy @CAPS1 and use @CAPS1 wisely cause remember not to laugh too hard because you don't want to end up pulling out "whotammy" "Thank you for reading my test in front of everyone around you.
Laughter is a good medicine for disease and a good medicine for pain. Laughter can mend a friendship and make two strangers the best of friends. One can ask anyone on the street how important laughter is to life and they will say that laughter is important. Like love, everyone needs a little love in their life, and like laughter, it can help a person grow and become an adult. A guy can use laughter to help them with anything like getting a job, or trying to get girls, or just having fun and making new friends. It is one of the main elements of life that makes a person who they are and what they do. In @DATE1, my cousin @PERSON1 introduced me to a girl named @DATE3. She started talking to me and I was shy because she's a girl and I'm not used to talking to girls. I made a joke and it made her laugh with me and it was the first step in making new friends. Days passed and we texted each other on the phone every day, joking about how our days were going and joking with each other. Eventually we started talking to each other on the phone. Today's teens typically don't use the phone to call others, which makes emotions difficult to understand because talking through text hides each other's emotions. @DATE3 call me and we'll chat until late at @TIME1, by which time we're all asleep, then keep the phone on, and we're always joking about everything. Making each other laugh is one of the only connections we have with each other since she went to different schools. Making her happy is what I need to do, and one of the ways to make her happy is to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentleman because that's how I grew up. @DATE2 is officially approaching and I need a date. @DATE3 is my go-to date as I get closer to her and I'm starting to get attached to her. When I get the chance, I ask her to be my date for an official @DATE2 event that will be one of my most special nights in first grade. The official day came and we danced @TIME1 and of course I had to joke about something else and it made everyone laugh and have a good time. Towards the end of the dance, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. She said I'm funny, nice, cute, and that's fine. We had a lot of fun because humor and fun keep @TIME1 alive. The next @DATE2 is official, the same thing happened to another girl, except the laughter was a big key that made @TIME1 so funny. @TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life because we kept laughing and had the best @TIME1 ever. Laughter is an important key in my life. I would never have gotten this girl or had the best @TIME1 of my life if it didn't involve laughter. Laughter makes everything better and I use it in my daily life because everyone needs a good laugh if they are in a bad mood. Without laughter, my life would be monotonous and not the color that made me who I am today. It's one of the many life keys that everyone needs to be happy, and without it you'd be less happy than you are now. A kid who can spend his entire childhood without laughter or any other important factor in life can end up being a mean and cruel person who doesn't understand good values and a sense of humor. Everyone's life needs personality and color, without it, everything is gray. Life is like a coloring book, there is no one or something to color it, it's just useless.
I had a lot of great time with my grandpa. He is a very funny and caring person. When my cousin, my grandfather and I got together camping, there was trouble anyway. A few years ago, he took my cousin and I on a two-day camping trip along @ORGANIZATION1. The first campsite we arrived had no vacancies, so we moved to the next campsite. @CAPS1 Campground has a lot of open campsites so we picked the best campground we could find and spent our first @TIME1 there. We didn't find out until later that night why there was no one at the campsite. The reason is that there was a raccoon problem a few days ago, people are afraid of staying in campgrounds, afraid of being attacked or food stolen. We were lucky and never saw a raccoon and never lost any food. Next @TIME2 On the way out we saw a sign that said "Beware of Raccoon Problems". @CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, a small town on @ORGANIZATION1. After arriving at @LOCATION1, we stopped for fuel and more food to maintain @TIME1. We had a little glitch at the gas station, but it was fun. A young blonde came out to help us, she wasn't the smartest person I've ever met. She charged us three times as much gas as we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, when my grandpa was shaking his window he was muttering "stupid blonde" loudly and the woman was standing there. She didn't say a word, and my grandfather drove me and my cousin away, laughing so hard that we could barely breathe. My grandpa asked why we laughed so hard, so we told him what it was like when he said stupid blonde. He was so blind to the situation that he didn't even notice what was coming out of his mouth at the time. Even better, he drove away like nothing happened. Next @TIME1 We stayed at a different campground without raccoons. @TIME1 still full of laughter. We roasted marshmallows over the fire after dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa couldn't put marshmallows on his stick. Before he could get one to eat, he wasted about six marshmallows. Every time he throws one into the fire, it gets more and more interesting. We laughed until our stomachs hurt. The best part was that my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid. We were so tired in @TIME1's tent that everything seemed fun to us. We laugh at each other at @TIME2 until two o'clock. That's when everything went quiet and we couldn't hold on any longer. We all fell asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have been going camping with my grandpa every year for about four years, and every year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we get closer to each other. My grandfather was a great man and I look up to him for so many things in life. He always makes me laugh and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that laughing together is important because it keeps you smiling and helps you feel closer to those around you. Keep laughing and enjoy everything you do.
"Laughter" I believe that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things get blurry between you and your loved one, making them laugh always helps break the ice. When I get mad at my boyfriend he knows that in order to make me happy he has to make me smile/laugh. That's exactly what he did. The first time he pissed me off, he didn't know what to do. This is @DATE1 @CAPS1, I just started dating. I remember him asking if I was hungry and I said "no, I'm not" so he kept asking. Because we haven't been dating for a long time, he really doesn't know much about me, so he doesn't know that I'm the kind of girl who gets angry easily and has a bad temper. He went on to ask if I was hungry, thirsty, bored or tired, but he didn't realize I was really angry at this point. An hour and a half later, he is still asking! I'm going crazy, I don't want to tell him how I feel because I know I'm going to make him feel bad, but I say to myself, "No, he has to know because later on he has to find out for himself what I like and what I don't like. Like what the relationship, not me telling him. I continued to tell him every detail about me, good or bad, at first he just listened, but by the end he broke out and told me why I wasn't directly with him from the beginning together. It was frustrating for me and I tried to be honest with him before something worse happened but I guess not. I stayed silent for the longest time and he kept asking me "what's wrong", "tell me what I did wrong" ", so I told him that it really upset me that he was mad at me for no reason, all I did was to save us from a bigger argument, and he looked at me and said I did wrong! He said we had Been together for 2 months and it took me to show him who I really am and I kind of understand where he's from but at the same time I don't agree because he should have known by then. I mean it's not necessary to know someone So long, especially if he's your girlfriend. In the end, we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other. He said "Ouch Charlie you bite me" in @CAPS2 accent, which was a relief to me, I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about you because we had a heated discussion. The point here is that when the going gets tough, laughter is a tool to break the ice, it's not necessarily a lover, it's It can even be a complete stranger, and if the person is shy, making them laugh will help build a deep friendship with them. You can make anyone's day great just by showing it on their face A little smile, a simple "hello" or "hey" can even make them smile. I'm sure people who smile a lot live longer. This @MONTH1 is not true, but it is true in my little world. I'm all about smiling and it's all about making people laugh. I honestly hate seeing people walking around with angry faces like they don't have friends when all they really want is someone to make They smile - that's me! All in all, if it weren't for the laughter, what relationship would stand on this point? No, because if you always fight, always win, and never laugh, then how do you want your relationship to be Go on? Like I said "laughing is the shortest distance between two people".
Angelina @CAPS1 @CAPS2 A year ago, sometime on @DATE2, I spent the night at my best friend @PERSON1's house after her @CAPS3 party. We swam in her @CAPS4 pool, took her dog for a walk, not to mention a party, if it wasn't for the family pack of @CAPS5 and six packs @ORGANIZATION1, we would have fallen asleep an hour ago before we finished eating. At around three at @TIME1, our childish minds were looking for something to do and we decided to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish, hoping they would glow in the dark on her windowsill. I was the first to dare to touch the brush with my tongue and boy did it hurt! The acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds. The next day was @DATE1, after hanging out at @LOCATION1's house in the afternoon, we came to my house again for the night, which is what we do and still do sometimes every time we are together. That night, this time around 2 at @TIME1, we were hungry again, went downstairs for a snack, then went back to my room, @PERSON1 was playing on my computer while I used her phone to text my former crush Short message. @PERSON1 had jars or ice water, I still don't know why she used jars instead of cups, interrupted my spin on the kitchen floor with my new socks, and we had a random instant ice cube contest. After ten seconds of silence, I glanced at my jar @LOCATION1, she wasn't halfway down. On her chin, there was a dot, a dot, a dollop of blue nail polish. I tried to catch enough air to start laughing at her, but instead of air going into my windpipe, ice did. Choking, laughing, falling on the floor, laughing, nail polish picking, etc. laughing, we stood in the middle of the kitchen, there was nothing funny, it was fun. @PERSON1 dropped her jar, it shattered on the floor, glass shards and water went through the kitchen, but that's ok. We had so much fun, and guess what, we fell asleep on the kitchen floor in less than ten minutes. I think we are more tired than we thought. We did clear the glass though. Some say laughter is the best medicine a doctor can use, it can cure any disease, and it can brighten anyone's day. Dentists' apprentices use laughing gas, and when they operate on your teeth, it makes people go crazy and smile, and it's not that painful until the next day, but that's because you just had a tooth pulled. Today @PERSON1 and I are still best friends. Sure, we'll fight, but they'll be over in a week or two. The longest fight we've ever had was a month and a half, it was a misunderstood rumor, another friend of mine started and we both ended up laughing @CAPS2 how stupid what happened. In the five or six years that @PERSON1 and I have been friends, we have realized that laughing is good for your health, both physical and emotional stress relief, so every time we meet, we try to laugh as much as we can. Inside jokes that pop up from completely unrelated things, a funny-looking guy walking by the side of the road, or just our own brains saying it's time to be happy again, all spark laughter. It hurts at times, but we can't help laughing harder because it's so funny.
Once upon a time, on a late rainy night, my friend @PERSON2 I decided it would be fun for @CAPS5 to hang out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us to the woods @PERSON2 The idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 Hide @PERSON2 The trailer would stay in the car @PERSON2 until the other two were ready to be discovered . Well, at one point when the four of us did this, @CAPS5 was pouring rain @PERSON2 and it was very muddy outside. Well the two hidden are @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 The two left in the car are my friends @PERSON3 @PERSON2 me. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made a signal to let others know if we were okay. The red flag is @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 @PERSON2 took care of everything at @PERSON2 after our small meeting, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 left @PERSON2 and I @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car waiting for @PERSON2 to count. After we count to about @NUM2, we hear @PERSON2 screaming. My first thought was they just bought chicken @PERSON2 maybe trying to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I'm curious @CAPS3 I open the door @CAPS3 I can better hear what they're saying. Sure enough came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 The ceremony behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looks like @CAPS4 is about to cry PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat in this little car thinking what they were running @PERSON2 screaming, @CAPS3 I was the brave one and decided to check it out at the moment. Of course @PERSON2 didn't want to look or feel like a coward following me. As I was walking down the road I saw them run up to me from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON2 said: "Right over there, I swear I saw something across the road!" @CAPS3 I walked to where @CAPS4 was pointing Where @PERSON2 looks around and thinks @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4 is just looking at stuff. But as I moved on, @PERSON2 grabbed me from behind, @PERSON2 screamed. I turned to @PERSON2 and looked at her thinking "what the hell is wrong with you guys!". @CAPS4 grabs my arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very scared look on his face. I turned to her @PERSON2 and asked her "what's wrong" @CAPS4 asked me, "why does that tree look white but has a big tan spot in the middle?!" @CAPS5 is dark @PERSON2 I don't see much Clear, but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 freaked out about. I went back to the car to get a flashlight hoping to see something better in the tree @PERSON2 and when I got back to @PERSON2 by the tree @ORGANIZATION1 let out a creepy scream @PERSON2 yelled "@CAPS6! It On the move, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's move @CAPS7!" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 took the flash from me as I approached the girl, turned @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 pointed @CAPS5 at the tree. Sure enough there is a big tan speck @PERSON2 White Tree. As we girls sit and wait for @CAPS5 to move again, @CAPS5 finally did it. I flash @CAPS5 @PERSON2 with a flash and start laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 stood at their feet, they wanted to hit me because they didn't know what was on the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approached me, I turned to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 and asked her "@CAPS3 @PERSON2 do you want to see your monster?" @CAPS4 freaked out again and asked what it was. I told her, "Look at @CAPS5 for yourself" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 and saw @CAPS5.... a large brown paper bag blown up by the wind. When I saw @CAPS4 say @CAPS5 I told @PERSON2 what @CAPS5 is @PERSON1 her @PERSON2 I started laughing @PERSON1 @PERSON2 her "horrible monster". Once I laughed at @PERSON2, we were all back in the car where @PERSON3 was waiting for @PERSON2 to leave. Since that night @PERSON2, @PERSON2 @PERSON2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Every time we think of @CAPS5, we start laughing at @PERSON2, making fun of each other for being afraid of the brown paper bag.
For me, laughter makes the world go round. A seance that keeps the world bright and full of happiness is much needed. If I had an old smile on my face, you would hardly have met me. There are many stores to choose from, but I think @TIME1 is the most interesting one. It still makes me giggle thinking about @TIME1. I'm going @LOCATION1 with my last boyfriend @PERSON1 on day 4 of @DATE1. They went a long way on @DATE1 and I was lucky enough to be with him and his mom. We dress to live with his mom @CAPS1 and good friends @CAPS2. The house there is stunning, beautiful all wood floors, large open plan living room combined with kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings and a beautiful large window with clear frame @CAPS3. @CAPS4. Even though the house is this good, my favorite part is putting on the rails. No more than a quarter of a mile across a wooded trail with two sets of tracks running in both directions @CAPS5, as far as the eye can see @CAPS5. My favorite part of the hole trip was wearing those tracks. This is our second @TIME1 stay at @LOCATION1 around @NUM1. @PERSON1 and I while walking on a refreshing @TIME1. We can barely see, and barely see each other holding each other tightly for balance. Smiling and giggling, we finally stumbled out of the very hidden trail entrance and onto the tracks. We started walking down the rails hand in hand, enjoying each other's gifts. In @CAPS4, the stars are the most amazing I've ever seen. I don't know why, but the sky seems to be on and it appears to be twice as big as the relay. @TIME1 @TIME1 is great for stargazing without clouds. So we decided to lie down between orbits and watch the stars. There we hugged for a nice @NUM2 minute minuet. Then @PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled look, and then I followed his gaze to see what caught his attention. In the distance is a light. Progress your use of t-words slowly. No problem, this is the @NUM1 train at @TIME1. Looking back, we all laugh at the sheer surprise of @TIME1's train. @CAPS5 The train is going, we jump off the track and wait for it to pass so we can regain our position. The train was slower than I expected. No more than @NUM4 to @NUM5 miles per hour. @PERSON1's eyes lit up with a thought, didn't expect him to say "We should jump!" @CAPS5 Soon @CAPS5 words left his mouth and he regretted saying those words. I think it's a good idea! But he tried desperately to convince me not to. I walked down the track and told him to live a little longer and let's have fun. I've never skipped a train before, but by the looks of it, @TIME1 train is perfect for trying it out. There are cars that wear long flat beads, each with handy little shoelaces. I jumped on a dress before @PERSON1 stopped me. He finally gave in and jumped to the next one. We were both smiling and having a wonderful @TIME1 as we jumped off and hugged. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started coming towards us. Terrified, I definitely thought we were in trouble, I dashed to the trailhead and @PERSON1 approached my cure. I couldn't find the trail, and the light was getting closer, so we both headed straight for a big pile of bushes at full speed. We stayed there completely motionless, told the light to pass us, and the train began to readjust its speed. I got a big laugh from @PERSON1 and we both couldn't help laughing. What are the chances of going out for a walk and all that @TIME1 happening. @PERSON1 still has a big smile and leans in to give me the perfect kiss. It was one of the best nights I've ever had. @TIME1 is just one example of how smiles and laughter are a big part of @PERSON1 and I in our relationship. Love, friends and laughter are reasons why life is worth living.
Being able to laugh is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share with is priceless. Family moments like these are moments no one can take away. They'll be there to make you look back and smile on those days. Not being able to laugh makes the world dull and frustrating. Laughter is the main link between family and friends. My family and I have decided to drive to the great land of @LOCATION1 when we take a break on @DATE1. @CAPS1 No how one of us got there, but my mom told us she'd figure it out and we don't have to worry. So the day we got out of school, my mom packed up and we set off. After two long rides, we finally arrived at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to go through is huge. On the boat to cross the river, I wanted to go up the stairs to see where we were. There's @LOCATION2. Once we disembark and cross the @LOCATION2 congested highway, start crossing the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 boundary. I noticed a strange look on my mom's face, a worried look on her face. My sister asked her @CAPS1 what she was doing and she replied "kind of". After a few hours of driving, my mom thought it would be a good idea to buy a map. When we looked at the map, we noticed a very close town. When we arrived, my mom said we would be staying overnight. When we all woke up, my mom told us that the town she remembered was the town we were supposed to be in. After driving around town to find our hotel, we all rested in our room as we drove around everywhere. My sister made a comment to my mom about how fun it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS1 what she's doing. It made us all laugh. We all started casually commenting on her excellent navigation skills. We drove the car for the rest of the journey and told my mom, laughing, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. The laughter at our lost made this trip a truly memorable moment. Being able to laugh is the greatest feeling in the world. Doing it with your family is a great way to remember happy times. Not laughing makes this life scary and boring. Being with family and taking a negative situation and turning it into the best laugh holiday ever was really invaluable. Everyone needs a laugh in their life, because you only live once, so make it worthwhile.
Laughter brings the world together in ways that cannot be expressed in words. When two people laugh about the same thing together, a special bond like no other is created. There is no way to describe this connection and how it creates a relationship. Everyone on @LOCATION2 wants to experience the bond that laughter brings. Last time @DATE2, I was on a select hockey team and I didn't know any girls there. The team had five practice sessions before the game, and by the third practice session, I still hadn't talked to many of the girls there. I'm too shy to talk to these girls who seem to have friends with them on the team. On the fourth practice, we all stretched in a circle, and I commented on one of the girls and she laughed. We started talking, and in the next exercise, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh, I made a friend on the team and got more excited about the upcoming game. The final practice was shortened so the team could make tie-dye T-shirts to wear during the game. I sat down with @PERSON2, who was my friend from last practice session, and her friend @PERSON1 came over and sat on the concrete with us. We all started talking and laughing. Our shirts are tied with rubber bands and we're going to put dye on them. We laughed and messed around with multiple colors, had a good time, and enjoyed the warm evening. As we sorted out our shirts and packed our soaked clothes into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot to say goodbye. I now have two friends on the team and can't wait to play @DATE1. On @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, or. We all had meetings there, loaded our stuff into three big white vans, and drove as a team. I climbed into the van wearing tie-dye t-shirts and saw some girls looking tired and wearing tie-dye shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 sat in the back with another girl in between, so I sat in the row in front of them. A few more girls from the convoy squeezed into the van and we hit the road. During the @NUM2 @NUM3 hour drive, we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in a car together for so long, we all connect with each other in laughter and storytelling. Each of us came from a different city, school and background, which made our car trip a lot of fun. During the game, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields almost all the time, eating and laughing together. The only time we were separated was when assigning roommates and we were not placed in a room. We all pull together and work towards a common goal of winning games and winning championships. All the girls on this team are connected in some way, and even now, most of us are still connected to each other. The laughter brought @PERSON2 and me together, and the rest of the team followed. The whole team came together in laughter and we all became more comfortable laughing and having fun. Bringing together @NUM4 girls from completely different cities can be a major disaster, but we connect with each other by making everyone else laugh and it's a positive experience for all involved. Laughter is really the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another person through laughter is an experience everyone should have, and it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a better, brighter and more united place.
Humor is a big part of me and I like to make people laugh, but this story is about an incident that made my whole family fall to the floor laughing. It all started @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline as a birthday present. It's a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids because we can all play whenever we want. After that, we were always at my cousin's house. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest tricks. Sometimes we would fall, or one of us would get hurt, and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play for a while, but they would always give in and let us play again. It wasn't until a few months later that we witnessed the funniest accident we've ever seen in our lives. It all started with my aunt's birthday party. Usually she eats it at some fancy restaurants, but not this year, this year she decided to eat it at home to save some money. So we all showed up at my auntie party, my mom, my brothers, and me. First, we would do all the usual birthday activities, family meet up, have a bite to eat, and sing happy birthday. Basically boring stuff in my opinion. I mean come on, there's a trampoline in the backyard just waiting to jump on, but the adults won't let us near it until we're done eating. Eventually everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids play. It starts out as normal as any other day we go to the trampoline, but little did we know that all of our stomachs are going to hurt from laughing in the coming hours
It's a normal day and I just woke up because my friend @PERSON2 called me and wanted to know if I wanted to hang out. I said yes, and I went to take a shower and get ready. When I was ready, I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hang out. He told me he wanted me to play basketball at Kyle House. When I got there, everyone was there, so we decided to have a big basketball game. I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but it was really embarrassing that I missed every shot I made, but it's not surprising that my team ended up winning. After the game, we were all tired and went in to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1 and we took turns and when it was my turn I did a terrible job because I don't play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself. After we played, I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who went to the movies that night and wondered if everyone and I wanted to go. Everyone decided to go and we all wanted to see the movie Paranormal activity @NUM1 so we were pretty excited and before the movie we all went to @PERSON1's house and hung out with all the girls. We were all sitting in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were going up the stairs to get ready. I was bored so I went up the stairs to hang out with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the moment I got there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them do my makeup . So I went back down the stairs and warned everyone not to go there. They asked why, and when I told them they all laughed, some of them went up there anyway, put on makeup back there, and I laughed so hard that I fell off the couch. Once I finally stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there weren't enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we squeezed in the front seat and the rest were in the back so I was happy . The queue was long when we entered the cinema, but it was worth it. Surprisingly, the movie was kind of scary and it made me jump five times. When we drove home, like @NUM3 and @PERSON3, I was walking home from her house and he was freaking out on the way back, it made me laugh, it made him laugh and I was kinda freaked out too. I thought it was a really fun day because I was laughing most of the time.
@CAPS1 is my personal belief that hilarity and dizziness are the best emotional states. So @CAPS1 it makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things stay on good terms. @CAPS1 Because their minds are similar, they connect and find joy in each other's company. My story is an example of human laughter and the strength of the connection in the form of @CAPS1. Imagine a scenario: @CAPS1 is @DATE2 on the north side of @CAPS2. The hood under the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a frail eleven-year-old boy who didn't think he could go on any longer. Standing patiently beside him is his father, a veteran mountaineer who has climbed mountains in @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. The boy was so tired that he couldn't put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. @DATE1 The sun was on him and the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. @CAPS1 As if the mountain wanted him to fail and urged him to give in and cry in failure. Fatigue then consumed the boy, adding 50 pounds to each limb. His brain also darkened, leaving him with only simple thoughts, such as standing in front of each other. He starts looking for any excuse to stop, and does so often. The boy's father tried everything to keep his son motivated to keep going, but to no avail. He tried another approach, he started telling stories to boys, perhaps hoping that @CAPS1 would put the boy's heart in extreme pain. To reassure everyone involved, @CAPS1 proved to work. The funniest thing about the whole campaign was that @CAPS1 wasn't the content of the story helpful, @CAPS1 was the humor and sarcastic tone that made the real impact. I describe it as a solution to laughing gas and an energy drink rushing to me. In the presence of my father's humor, I found the strength to keep going. @CAPS1 Like I'm fully charged and refreshed. My arms and legs that used to feel like solid lead pipes have lightened considerably. The tingling in my muscles and joints went away and left. The dull throbbing of the blisters on my heels was silenced. It's all due to someone's thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bones. I believe that laughter is nature's anaesthetic, the emotional element that keeps the world sane. @CAPS1 It was at that time that I realized what I had the most respect for my father. I have no shortage of traits to choose from. He has an unrelenting work ethic, is a great teacher, and possesses extraordinary energy. But what I respect most about him is our similar sense of humor. We laugh at the same things and find laughter in each other's comments. @CAPS1 created a strong bond between us, a bond of excitement and joy that continues to this day. He always managed to put a smile on my face whenever I was depressed, and I found that I had the same ability. In my opinion, the relationships formed in laughter are the strongest relationships. Laughter is a force that paves the way for friendship, respect and love. You can't have hope for a better future if you don't have laughter. @CAPS1 is medicine from the sky. A drug that runs through the bloodstream of society. In the process, free your mind from the stress and worry that tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite crowds and instill a sense of friendship in society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned around to find someone across the room starting to laugh at the same moment. Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spreads across your face as you realize you're not alone in your thoughts and your laughter. This connection is the result of laughter.
Laughing, smirking, giggling, @CAPS1 chuckling; it's all about a theme, and @CAPS1 is laughing. Laughter is everywhere, you hear it in the library, in the park, at home, behind your back, @CAPS1 in @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 it can be a good thing or a terrible thing, even with family Friends of @CAPS1. Everyone has a laughing past, having welcomed them, helped them, cheered them up, or even made a very special friend who will be with them forever. This is the start of my brand new @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 that I just moved from @LOCATION2. I'm a 7th grader about to start @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 isn't really a big fan of hanging out with people so I'm stuck with myself most of the time, having lunch at the Guidance Center, trying to get Clearly publish the book without talking to anyone. I have a great schedule, I have choir, art, theater, you know all the things I love. Art @CAPS1 plays are popular, but when it comes to singing in choir @CAPS1 my social level drops. I love to sing, but I've never sang in front of people. Then one day, I walked to the choir @CAPS1 and I stumbled on @CAPS1 and my files fell with it. My @ORGANIZATION1 work is all over the hall, with math on one end and science on the other. But of all the children in the hallway, only one laughed. She stopped by @CAPS1 and said I did a good job but something prompted her to come back. She helped me with all my math homework @CAPS1 picked up my calendar @CAPS1 saw she had a choir during this period too. Her name is @PERSON1, she told me, @CAPS1 I told her my name, @CAPS1 Let's go together. We sit together @CAPS1 and I sing along with her and our voices. We talked between classes, at lunchtime, and on the bus home. We became good friends @CAPS1 The principal thinks so too @CAPS1 He goes on @CAPS1 to teach us lessons. We were friends @CAPS1 and we are still friends today. But sadly, she moved towards the end of eighth grade. But she was my only friend @CAPS1 for a while when I always called her @CAPS1 every moment. Sometimes we can chat for hours laughing @CAPS1 about how we did in @CAPS1 when we meet again. She's been my best friend @CAPS1 for at least 2 years and it all happened on one foot, that file drop, @CAPS1 laughs from an amazing person. @CAPS1 from @ORGANIZATION1 has made me laugh so far. Now @CAPS1 Then when I see someone, alone, and want a friend, I go to @CAPS1 and talk to them, @CAPS1 even laughs with them. A small laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen. Even if you don't think so, it is. Someone said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". @CAPS1 I believe who said that because it happened to me.
When it comes to laughter, it can change a person's mind or even the mood @CAPS4 is in. Laughter can be the end result, the start of a bad day, or the enhancement of a relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it expresses my feelings, it makes me happy, I laugh not only when I am sad, but also when I am in a good mood. Growing up in a world full of tragedy and war, I think you should always keep your head up and your face smiling. Although, when life gives you lemons, you have to make lemonade to make your face look sour because it's fun! I think laughter is one of the best medicines and can solve most problems when you are feeling down. @CAPS2 Sister brings the most amazing little niece in the world, what an aunt can have. When @CAPS4 was a baby I used to do silly faces, dance to @PERSON1 and watch movies with them, but that's not what brought us closer. Exactly what I wanted to laugh about, which made them happy too. At one point, I was really frustrated, but I didn't want it to affect me, so I started watching the music video before @CAPS2 day, when @ORGANIZATION1's "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3" came. @CAPS4 is crazy! , @CAPS4 started jumping up on the bed, spinning their @CAPS3 back and forth as if @CAPS4 was @ORGANIZATION1! , @CAPS4 really stole the show. I couldn't believe it until this happened in front of @CAPS2's eyes, I was ecstatic. I felt their joy, I had to get up and dance with them, we danced, we swirled, we dizzy and breathless whipped @CAPS3 a few times before the song ended. After we had fun with the music video, @CAPS4 kept dancing and in @CAPS2's mind I was like "don't @CAPS4 never get tired" but I'm pretty sure their laughs gave them a continual surprise . A smile is worth a thousand words, a laugh is priceless, @CAPS2 niece is really what made me grow up that day. It's bitter at first, but then sweet, let's call it bittersweet. I think @CAPS2's niece will be sad to know I'm so @CAPS4 will say "@CAPS5 what's up", @CAPS5 is @CAPS2's nickname because I'm short. @CAPS4 always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. My relationship with @CAPS2 neices has grown to the max and I know I laugh every time I'm with them. If someone ever said "laughing is the shortest distance between two people" then @CAPS4 is right because I @MONTH1 in a different country, state or any other place, but whether we talk on the phone or physically meet, I will laugh at all their crazy antics the more we are one.
Laughter in your life is an important part of showing who you really are. Some people think you @MONTH1 are someone who can get "stuck" or a funny person who can really "get stuck", but in the end you all laughed together no matter who they were. You can't help but laugh when you see something really funny happening. Or even if you're nervous, everyone will laugh it off. All different types of people have different ways of showing how they use laughter in their own lives. "@CAPS1 is blue, roses are red, you're always on my mind, I hope you're in my bed..." This should be a love poem. When you are in a relationship with someone, you may think you are in love. If your partner never discloses anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue with your sweetheart for a while and then laugh it off because you're stupid to even discuss it. Your relationship includes love and laughter. Friendship is another important relationship for laughter. For example, my friend and I were invited to a birthday party and she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend I went to the party with her name is @PERSON1. It's getting late and we're all tired. We didn't do anything, this could be around @NUM1 in @TIME1. Seeing as we do love to sleep for some reason, but we just had a great time at a friend's house, we didn't want the night to end at all. About four hours ago, we were sitting on the ground in bed watching "@CAPS2 A". Then I randomly started laughing at @LOCATION1 and to this day I don't know why I'm laughing at her. Suddenly she started laughing harder at me and then I started laughing harder because she was laughing. I almost got to the point where I couldn't breathe. So I got up and walked to the bathroom, but I could still hear @CAPS3 laughing in the room and it still made me laugh. Since that night @PERSON1 my friendship and I have grown even closer. Laughter is a lot in life. Sometimes it can make you feel like you're dying, but the feeling is worth it.
We all know that water is what we need most to sustain life, because without it we would almost die. Well, it's also similar to laughter. I once heard my evening teacher say, "@CAPS1 is the attitude of @PERCENT1". I thought about it for a while and realized it wasn't true. No one can really spend the whole cave day without a drink of any kind and get frustrated for any clothing reason and soon end with a smile. Who knows maybe the dumbest thing ever. I've been out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1 for about seven months. We can't meet as often as I would like. We spend as many weekends together as possible, but sometimes every other weekend. Since he and I gave up some commonalities like our relatives, we met before dates, we went to entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike where we will spend time together or what we are doing. Even though we've been dating for about seven months, it feels like we've known each other before we became friends. Once, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister when I celebrated @PERSON2's birthday at @LOCATION1's house. We, all who were there, celebrated her birthday with piñatas, cakes and everything she wanted, plus toys. We all had a lot of fun, but the kids didn't as much as they seemed to run out of energy as they spent hours on the trampoline. Before the kids can even mention anything about the pinata, we've got most of what it takes to set up a pinata. When they heard that the candy was being drilled into the pinata, they all got there before anyone else, possibly bumping into the pinata. @PERSON2 went to the pinata before everyone else, because it was her birthday, so the kids followed her to the pinata. It wasn't the best when they went up to knock our singing pinatas, but we tried them all. We even joked and pretended to imagine who the pinata represented. As time passed, it was the turn of the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us are a little shy, but went up and hit a pinata before I noticed a @NUM1 year old. Just after she hit Pinata hard, everyone else said her time was up and they couldn't wait to get the candy out. When it's her turn, she should call someone. I thought she would end up calling me because she kept looking at me. I was already blushing, but fortunately she didn't. She ended up calling my boyfriend. Of course he got up and hit the Pinata with a stick. Once he got there, everyone else said don't hit so hard or the little guys won't like him. Because he's one of those people who loves everyone @CAPS3. He encouraged me to go with him. I don't think I would have done it without him saying it. Right there with us, teaching me how to swing a stick to hit a pinata, I swung it hard and ended up hitting him. @CAPS2 didn't say anything, one of his aunts said it. I do this whenever I'm annoyed with him. @CAPS3 slow at first, then hits him where it hurts the most. I was even more red then and I just wanted to say it might be true @CAPS3 and then @PERSON1' mom had the cake out and I just left where I was going to help her out. Once we all settled down and sang happy birthday to @LOCATION2, we were still laughing at what happened. The thing is they are still talking about it. It can be the same when we become happy. Again, I don't know what to say, so I just keep it simple. Everyone left, and just before I called Dad, he was outside the door. I just say thank you dad, with a smirk.
Just @CAPS1 and one of your best friends wearing a banana outfit for @ORGANIZATION2. We try to find the best outfits for the @CAPS2 party. We lose track of time when we have so much fun by taking many photos and videos. I don't even remember who of us laughed the hardest. @CAPS3 is just one example of the crazy things my friend @PERSON1 and I do together . One thing is for sure, whenever we are together, we are always laughing. Laughter takes the pressure off @PERSON1 and me. We have been team members for the past six years. We are both gymnasts at @ORGANIZATION1. We work out four hours a day at the @DATE1 gym. This leaves us with no time to hang out with friends and just enough time for homework. At @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I need to focus so we don't get hurt. @CAPS3 means off the field, we need laughter to reduce stress and fear. To do this, we hang out a lot on weekends and in the @DATE2 sun. Our friendship is strong because of all the laughter and happy times together. When either of us gets stressed, we cheer the other up by remembering when we laughed. Even when we're not together, we're often reminded of the memories we shared together. As mentioned earlier, laughter can also help reduce fear. It's helpful because if you don't have fun and laughter, you'll think of all the bad things that could happen to you; then you'll have laughter, which makes you want to do anything with your friends. The laughter that @PERSON1 shares with me always keeps others attached to us. Whenever we are together, other people always want to join because we have a great time together. For example, @DATE2 we were in @LOCATION1's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing when suddenly one of her neighbors showed up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, and after a while, we seemed to have the whole community with us. When we have a large group, @PERSON1 and I pick a different game that is better for a lot of people. It is usually a mark game of hide and seek. Even though it's not just the two of us, we're always laughing because we fool everyone who's playing. Even with more people, it created a good and positive bond for both of us. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS3 is why @PERSON1 and I are such great friends today. Without laughter, I don't think we would be close friends without laughter in our friendship. Every time we meet, our laughter brings us closer. Laughter really connects the bond between friends, and it can help the two of you through difficult times.
"Many others believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship." Many others believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with these ideas. Regarding @DATE1, I came to @LOCATION1 and I haven't said @CAPS1 during that time. I started school. Before going to school, I practice saying my name, age and where I'm from. I walked into the school the next day and I could see everyone was looking at me. This is scary to me. I looked back at a girl who came towards me. "@CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1," the girl said. "@CAPS2, my name is @CAPS4. I'm from @LOCATION2. I don't say @CAPS1," I said to @PERSON1, who started laughing. "@CAPS6-@CAPS6 you have an accent," @PERSON1 said, "really cute." I laughed back. @PERSON1 looked really good with a smile and we became friends in no time. She is my first @CAPS7 friend. I always thought it was hard to make new friends, but laughter made it a lot easier than it used to be.
Laughing is the best way to show someone that they are funny. This is the best way to relax. Everyone said it was great to hear a baby laugh. Watching a comedian act can cheer people up and make them start laughing. Laughter is the best way to relax, and here are three reasons. First of all, no one is angry with someone who makes them laugh. Second, when someone laughs, everyone around that person starts laughing. The third and final reason is that no one stays sad when something funny happens. What do you think when you hear a baby's laughter? I think this kid is truly loved by the family. He or she is playing with someone in the family or with someone of their own. They think whatever you do is fun. A comedian's job is to make a group laugh or laugh with them. One way comedians perform is stand-up comedy. That's when a comedian performs his or her performance on stage. Another way is comedy. Comedy can be @CAPS1.V. A show, play or film. Comedies usually have no plot, but the point is to get you and the other person to start laughing. That's my take on laughter. It can help anyone relax. It's great to hear the baby's laughter. Comedians love to hear people laugh or laugh with them.
@CAPS6 It only happened one day a few weeks ago and all students should go out to play or sleep because there is a lot of snow outside. A man crying in a chair, hands over his eyes, a French horn in his lap, his eyes fixed on the ground below him. Sobbing choked the sound in the band's room, but luckily for the guy's pride, the room wasn't too crowded at first. The lad looked up, the tears seemed to eat up the strength of a normal person, @CAPS2 spoke to the man who had been sitting to his left. "@CAPS1 just don't understand @PERSON2" broken voice cracked in the words, "I don't care if @CAPS1 plays in Cascade Wind, or @CAPS1 gets private lessons, or @CAPS1 is in the National Honor Band! This @MONTH1 listens Sounds like a bad reason, but I just want to play first because I want to play first and @CAPS1 would never let us play first." @CAPS2 got it right, @PERSON2 really never let us Play first. I somehow understand where @CAPS3 is coming from; @CAPS4 I've been sitting under him during my freshman year and he's under someone else and so on. I've never seen him as the first chairman of anything. And now, in his senior year, a child prodigy joins the band, she just knows how to fight for her first chairmanship. In short, @CAPS3's four years for the first chair position in the band summed up as second best from the moment she stepped into the room. The feeling of all his hard work turned into banality on his face, and over time he burst into tears. @PERSON2 is so much better than us, she has the credits @CAPS6. She has attended the cascade winds solo festival, band camp and will be heading to @LOCATION1 as a music ambassador. There's still something about her having the first part that doesn't feel quite right. Maybe @CAPS6 is also the superiority I want. @PERSON2 took over and leaned closer. "I know @CAPS1 wants to be number one," @CAPS10 said confidently, "but now we need specific players in specific positions. I play harder music and my skills are what the first part needs. I understand you I've been there before." @CAPS6 Strange to me that a sophomore is telling a senior. How can she feel how @CAPS2 feels? She's been a wunderkind of @CAPS7 @CAPS8 since the beginning. I support @PERSON1, but @CAPS10 I realize it would be worse for the band to have him in a more demanding role. So I try to support @PERSON2, but @CAPS10 I can only think of this as @PERSON1's last year as a horn player for @CAPS7 @CAPS8. They have been attacking each other. Every comment argues over an already fragile surface. The minutes of the meeting intensified the quarrel. I had to think faster. @CAPS9 Argument continues like this, the horn part will be torn and cooperation will be useless. More importantly, I would lose two partners who together uprooted a lot of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them and told them my thoughts. "@CAPS9 a man has no socks," I like to start my thoughtful talk with a cryptic beginning, "@CAPS10 also...". as far as I know. I think @CAPS6 is great, but their expressions are different. So they call me crazy and giggle @CAPS10 They make fun of me and laugh. Thank goodness I forgot what they called me because I really wanted to remember what I wanted to say. @CAPS3 finally stopped crying, @PERSON2 got my word, @CAPS3 is a senior who doesn't get much chance to be the first chair in the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 band. They settled the fight with a simple deal. As soon as we stop playing, @CAPS3 will get the first chair. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 I'm always the center of the teasing. But as annoying as @CAPS6 is, sometimes it's usually fun for everyone, including myself. I can't even imagine what kind of band @CAPS9 would be, their hostility has risen to unforgivable levels. There has been a heated discussion before that made some of our stress levels too high, so @CAPS7 @CAPS6 made it hard for @CAPS6 to breathe. Even laughing before they're about to tear each other's faces, giving them time to understand how much they understand each other. Or open your eyes to see how long they'll have to sit next to each other to keep fighting. Anyway, @CAPS6's definition has changed how they feel about each other; I haven't heard them compromise each other in a while. @CAPS3 eagerly awaits his turn to shine and @PERSON2 for better or worse can’t wait to see him play.
We had fun together @PERSON1 told me @CAPS2 we were in his bed. I just laughed and knew it was going to be a really good relationship. @CAPS5 always makes me feel great. @CAPS5 makes me feel pretty. Now don't say you're too young to know what love is, @CAPS1 I hear it from my mom every time I talk about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel so good about myself and make me feel perfect. It's fun when we're together. Most of the people I've interacted with are not as fun as @CAPS2, who walks to the park and sits and chats, goes out to dinner and kisses in public when we date together. Before we dated, we were best friends. We are still best friends. Everyone asks us @CAPS6 We're dating and the answer is always no, we're best friends, but I keep wanting more. @CAPS5 always makes me laugh. I don't think we're going to be such a strong pair @CAPS6, we didn't make each other laugh. Thinking about @CAPS4, the first time I know I love him makes me laugh. I'm walking to my @DATE1 class and out of nowhere @PERSON1 grabs my arm and pulls me into a giant bear hug, buries his head in my neck and laughs: "@CAPS3 you got some toilet paper to stretch Get out your pants" I felt like my face turned twenty shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my @DATE1 class, I was thinking @CAPS4 can @CAPS5 say to me, @CAPS5 must be embarrassing me. But the more I think about what @CAPS5 did, what @CAPS4 @CAPS5 did makes me think, it makes me think @CAPS5 really cares about me. Want to help me and not embarrass me. I bet everyone else is laughing. Not @PERSON1...we had a good laugh after that. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, @CAPS5 looked up and kissed me. I don't know @CAPS6 if that was a best friend kiss or a real love kiss. So I just smiled. Then @CAPS5 kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We are also not like most couples. It makes us stand out, and the more we stand out, the more people start hating the fact that we're together. They would tell me some horrible things about @PERSON1 in the hallway. Who knows what they are telling him. @CAPS7 Some of my closest friends started making rude comments about me and @PERSON1. I know @CAPS5 doesn't believe anything they say @CAPS1 @CAPS5 will laugh at everything people will toss our way. When @CAPS5 laughs I always ask him what's so funny, @CAPS5 will say "@CAPS6 their rumours aren't true and laugh at them so people will know you won't be bothered by them" I never thought . I'm the kind of girl who keeps her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I get a little pissed off about everything they say about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people said, . They don't talk about us anymore, it's like magic. I never thought to be at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 let alone @ORGANIZATION1 and find someone who understands what I'm going through. Not to mention someone who is going through almost @CAPS2 hardships. My brother is in jail on @DATE1 and I don't think I can do much @CAPS2 what I did with @PERSON1 with @CAPS2. I cry with him almost every day at @ORGANIZATION1. It's been almost a year now. Every time I see my bro, I remember @PERSON1 saying, "@CAPS6 you're happy and everyone around you will be happy" so I always see @LOCATION1, @CAPS7 with a smile though I know this will It was the hardest years of my life. Laughing really helps. @CAPS7 @CAPS6 Nothing funny. God put you on this @LOCATION2 for a reason and @CAPS6 you didn't find that reason to laugh until you did. @CAPS1 The people in your life mean the world to you, @CAPS6 They are disappointed. I love @PERSON1 because it helped me understand that life is short, unhappy and living a life without laughter.
Everyone loves to laugh; I don't think everyone understands the effect of laughter on two people. For example, there may be two complete strangers who have never met in their lives; once they start laughing, they can become good friends. You'll never know how close you are to someone if you don't sit down and talk, laugh, and get to know them. You can spend your whole life at @CAPS4 with only one minute of friends, but there may be @NUM1 other classmates you never talk to who may also be your friends. I'm sure just getting to know each other can change someone's life because for me, in many cases, laughter has had an impact on my relationship with someone. Especially my best friend @PERSON1. When I first met my friend @PERSON1, we didn't know each other at all, but laughing broke the ice. A simple laugh made us feel comfortable and everything became less awkward. When we start laughing more and more, we can't stop; the rest is history. I went to elementary school @CAPS4 @NUM2 years with @PERSON1 and never spoke to her, but as we got into @NUM3 grades we started hanging out with the same people and started chatting more. By grade @NUM4, we started hanging out outside @CAPS4, chatting, sharing secrets and sleeping over. But "breaking the ice" isn't the only effect laughter has on relationships. When I'm with @PERSON1, I know I can trust her and it's all fun. We always have talk to talk and laugh about. You could say it brings us closer. By @NUM5 grade we were best friends and we would spend the night in each other's house every weekend. We spent weeks in each other's houses when we arrived @DATE1 before @NUM6 grades in @CAPS3 @CAPS4. There's not a day when we're not together, chatting, or making plans to hang out on @DATE1. Now, we can be ourselves around each other; we can always have fun. Bringing people closer is only a small part of the impact one laugh can have on two people. When I feel bad about something, @PERSON1 makes everything better; vice versa; I also make her feel better. We always keep each other back. I know we will always be there for each other; I will always have a shoulder to cry on. We've become such close friends that when @PERSON1 has a problem at home, she needs a place to stay so she doesn't have to go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 so she lives with me! Living with her is the most fun. We thought we would start bickering and it wouldn't be that close because we would always be together and probably get angry with each other, but we didn't. @PERSON1 and I can hang out with @NUM7 and be together forever; it's like having another sister. @PERSON1 and I are very close and she plans to live with me for the rest of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 until we graduate. When we first started talking in @NUM3 grades, it was amazing how close we were to be best friends and live together forever and be totally at ease with each other in everything. That's why I believe that with just a smile, two strangers who have never spoken can become the closest friends.
A @DATE1 @TIME1 back to @DATE2 a few friends and I'm so bored. It doesn't seem like much fun. @CAPS1 going to the movies, @CAPS1 going for something to eat, not even @CAPS2's call sounds interesting. @LOCATION1 Parents told us to go outside and do something. Before leaving his house, he slipped into his pantry and grabbed two large rolls of @CAPS11 packaging. "I think I have an idea" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 as we leave his house. I don't know where we are going. @PERSON1 just keeps saying "follow me". We all followed the street until we showed up at @ORGANIZATION1. Cold and confused, we sat in the parking lot of @ORGANIZATION1 waiting for all the cars to clear up. Once all the cars are gone, @PERSON1 will tell us what we're doing here. He told us about something he did with his cousins not long ago. Three people scout the road on the roof of @ORGANIZATION1's @ORGANIZATION1 and you have four @CAPS4. "@CAPS4?" I asked @PERSON1 blankly. "@CAPS5, @CAPS4" @CAPS6 @CAPS4 is the one who wrapped @CAPS11 across the street. The plan is that when no cars are coming in the distance, we jump over the fence and wrap @CAPS11 across the street for cars to drive past and stop. "@CAPS7 sounds interesting, but what happens when @CAPS15 stops and takes it off before @CAPS11 wraps it?" @CAPS8 @CAPS9, looking down on the whole operation. @PERSON1 laughed a little, @CAPS8 "@CAPS10 That would be an inconvenience to the driver." @CAPS11 Ring road sounds like fun, then black ops, so we're all disappointed. Everyone is in place. Mark, @PERSON4, @PERSON2 and myself are in some bushes in a secluded area by the road. Provide us with updates on oncoming traffic as @PERSON1, @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 are posted on rooftops. We got a call from @CAPS9 saying it's still clear for now. I hung up and told the guys and @DATE3 to get up off the ground. We all quickly crossed the fence and started the first tier of @CAPS11 packaging. I got another call. @CAPS14 said three cars were approaching our location. We threw the @CAPS11 package into the bushes and over the fence. @CAPS15 approached, it was a cop. Of course. We were all hiding in the bushes while the police held our large rolls of packages. We only have one roll left, which should be enough. @CAPS9 calls again, @CAPS8 is clear. We went out again and started setting up pranks. We wrap it in @NUM1 times and make it as tight as possible. perfect. "@CAPS15 here! Go! Go! Go!" Mark yelled as he tried to get over the fence. We all finished in time and were prone on the spot. Someone lay there anxiously, whispering "It's coming". @CAPS15 slams on the brakes and the driver gets out. He watches @CAPS11 wrap in disgust, looking around for responsible kids. @CAPS9 made a huge "hahaha" from the roof that even we could hear. The guy walked up to the fence, looked around, muttered swear words in a low voice. He didn't even bother to go on, he just got into his @CAPS15 and backed up. "@CAPS16 Omg this is hilarious!" I laughed as my @NUM2 @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 rushed across the field with horrified looks. "@CAPS18!" @CAPS19 yelled and ran in different directions. Mark, @PERSON2 and I climbed over the fence and ducked in the game structure for a while. And the rest of the boys are booking it to a safe haven. We both ended up meeting at @LOCATION1's house without being "caught" by the authorities. Laughter really plays a key role among a large group of friends like me on nights like @CAPS6. Laughter and running bring us closer together as a group. It brings us together.
I agree with people that laughter is the thing that brings people together the most. In my opinion @NUM1 times you need a laugh when you talk to someone. It's what dulls a person and makes a conversation interesting. You only need laughter if you're talking about serious things, but that's explained later. So I can easily tell a true story about laughter in my life. Now I have the perfect group of friends. Sure sometimes they screw up and act like kids, but I feel like I need to forgive and remember they were there when I needed them. Anyway, I remember when I first met each of them, one of the things that started our friendship was a joke. I don't remember which joke we shared, but I remember we all had the same taste in comedy. And once we see that neither of us are serious and dull people, it makes us want to spend more time with each other. That's why laughter creates a bond between different people, bringing them closer day by day. So over time, my friends and I were really drawn to each other. I mean, we like to express our friendship through jokes from time to time. Sometimes jokes are really stupid. Many of them caused physical pain and caused us to retaliate against each other. But that's how we stay close to each other. Day in and day out, when we see something funny on TV, online or in real life, we always show it to each other and know that after showing the prank, the other person will find it funny. It makes us feel closer and know that we all have the same taste in at least one area. I can give an obvious example: I was watching a comedy where the comedian was talking about his childhood and the pranks he used to play at a stranger's house. When I saw this video, I knew right away that my friends had to see this because I know from past experience that they love these types of laughter. I'm right, as soon as they saw the show, they were amazed at how interesting it was, they were glad I shared it with them, and we were closer than ever. I would like to share another example from my life about laughter bringing two people closer together. So after telling you that laughter brings me closer to my friends, I also want to point out that when you're talking to a girl or boy, if you're a woman, laughter brings a sense of contour. So I met this girl, every time I talked to her, every time I had to tell a joke or a story to understand our subject. After a while, she started joking and making up stories. She told me she thought I was a different person, comparing me to other people. She said she meant I wasn't a boring person, which made her want to keep talking to me. I've always wished not to be a dull person, and jokes keep that from happening. Now, this girl and I are closer than ever, and the root of the relationship that started it was laughter. As you can see, laughter makes any relationship happy and open. Of course, when I'm talking about fun relationships, I mean some people take everything seriously and can't make jokes. But I really encourage you to laugh in your life, if you haven't already. Look at my life, I've used laughter, made a lot of friends, all kinds - just joked about stupid things. You don't have to be silly, but I'd say it really makes your life more fun if you use laughter.
These are some examples from @LOCATION2 that I remember when I had fun and laughter in @CAPS1's life. @CAPS1 It's fun to have them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and cousin @PERSON3 who lives next to @CAPS3 always ride bikes. Sometimes Joey rides my bike without asking @CAPS3 and I get mad at him. He will ride my bike like @CAPS1 is his. @CAPS3 and my cousins always race our bikes on the street. I've always been a race winner, the kind of bike I have is the @PERSON4 @CAPS1 is the @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike built for dirt and racing. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go to the back of some apartments on the street and we made a ramp. @CAPS1 is just dirt, but @CAPS1 is hard. One day it was raining so hard on @CAPS1 @CAPS3, @PERSON7, @PERSON3 and another of our neighbors asked us to come out, we asked our parents if it was okay, my parents said @CAPS1 is the same as @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he couldn't cause the rain outside @CAPS1 but he came out anyway. When @CAPS1 was muddy, we all got muddy when my bike tried to climb up the ramp. Then my cousin fell off his bike and got beat up. By the time we finished playing outside, we were already muddy and our bikes were full of dirt. My @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 because I was so muddy so she sent @CAPS3 straight to the shower. @CAPS3 and my cousins had a great time after we all cleaned up and we were playing super @PERSON5 brothers for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we don't play super @ORGANIZATION1, ride bikes or get wet with water guns and water balloons because it's too hot outside @CAPS1. We may be on our way to the park for free lunches, and schools always offer free lunches for those who want them. After we eat @CAPS3 a lot of my friends will go to the park to have lunch with my cousins, my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 will always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @ CAPS8 card. The body has @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. I have stacks of cards. @CAPS1 had a great time in the park with friends and family, just got wet eating in the park. When I was in @NUM2 grade, @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like three friends and we lived in @ORGANIZATION2 house almost every weekend. We'll be staying at @ORGANIZATION2's house because his backyard is huge and we'll always play hide and seek because @PERSON6 has a playroom with pinball machines, basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept in the @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was Grand Theft Auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 is a cool one game. I think laughing is an important part of friendship, and if you're having a good time with your friend and just laughing, that means he's a good guy. If your friends always make you laugh, then there are good friends around. Like I always hang out with @PERSON6 and @PERSON2 because they always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh. So that's why I think it's important to laugh with friends or family.
Someone once said that laughter is the best medicine. To me, it's like someone saying "@CAPS1! Life can't get better, so enjoy it while you @CAPS6!" @CAPS2 That's what I've been doing for a while, but laughing at everything is great Getting old soon. Sadly, I still laugh at most things, even the sad ones. I laughed because I thought if I did, then everything would be better. This is even far from what actually happened. In fact, @CAPS6 just causes more pain and suffering in most cases. Like when I met this guy named @PERSON1. He is fantastic. Most of the people who knew him thought he was a god, and he was always upset to hear others say that about him. He is alone. No more and no less. I see it that way, and so does he. When we first started talking to each other, I would give my friend @CAPS3 between notes and @CAPS8 to him. He's a very shy guy, so he never replies on a piece of paper. Instead, he asked @CAPS3 to tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to write messages on her phone and I would read them and reply. It was fun for a while, but I wanted to actually meet that person. I've seen a rare photo of him, he's really handsome, but nothing like a god. He has no wreath on his head, and has a @CAPS5 god skirt on it. No, he's just an ordinary kid dressed like a skater, a real scarecrow. He has jet-black hair (which he dyed), bright green eyes, and a smile that can shake the world. The signs in my head tell me to be careful, but I've never heard them, they just make my life worse. So one day when @PERSON2 (my friend) started texting someone, I attended a calligraphy conference with a few of my friends and our teacher at @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. I was a little curious so asked who it was. @CAPS8 said it was @PERSON1 and my heart seemed to be beating. "@CAPS6 you told him I said hello?" "@CAPS7." @CAPS8 told him I said hello, he asked if I was really there, @PERSON2 said yes. We were actually talking more than once a day back then. We go all the way back to @LOCATION1. A few months later, we're back to the old ways of talking. He was very kind, and he never had a moment of gaffe. He told me about his family (it's kind of weird, but I don't judge), his life, his future, how he feels and how much he wishes he could see me so he could give me a big hug (otherwise) A friend of @CAPS3 said the same, but @CAPS8 said he didn't say it out loud). I talked to him about it all as if we knew each other a little bit. I told him about my life but really had nothing to say because my life has been boring. I think we can actually get things going between us until he moves to @LOCATION2. I was a little upset, but that didn't bother me, just talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing different pictures of him. One morning at school, @PERSON2 came over and stared at me carefully. I asked what was wrong and @CAPS8 asked if anything was going to ruin my day. I told her that this would only happen when I got home, and we laughed at it. I know something is wrong and it's related to @PERSON1, but I just didn't notice it, hopefully it softens the blow I know is coming. @CAPS8 said he told her there would be no resolution between him and me. I sit there like my idiot and I say I know no way, he's him and I'm me. @CAPS8 says he's sorry and all the other excuses, but I don't listen. Instead, I ignored it and moved on with my life like I thought everyone should. Of course he made a date with @PERSON2 a few months later, but I let it go, just like @CAPS8, @CAPS8 said no to him and they stopped talking. So people who say laughter is the best medicine, obviously have not experienced the after-effects of all this.
Trust is a big thing between friends. Friends agree on the same thing, have an honest opinion about it, don't lose the trust between great friendships. You never know who can stay by your side with complete trust between the two of you. When you trust a friend, you rely on them to maintain a relationship with each other. Just like me and my friends. We agreed to tell each other everything that happened and not lie about anything. We agree to everything on the basis of trust. Our friendship has always been good and will not deceive each other. Tell the other person how we feel about certain things. Then we put all the opinions together and come up with a solution that we all agree on. That's why you should depend on each other as a team. When you break the trust between friends, you may not get the trust you used to. You are not told anything like you used to be. Like you should never lose trust in a friend. You seem different because you don't trust that much. You were told it was your fault for lying, or were not trusted for any reason. Like this time, a friend didn't tell me the whole truth about what she was doing behind the scenes. I lost most of my trust in her before I found out what she was doing. She's not as trusted as she used to be, but we're still friends. This is why it is important to have trust in a friendship or any relationship. You learn to trust each other in different ways and learn more about each other by building trust between you and others. When you have this kind of trust in others, you get more attention. You don't seem to be left out of anything. When you get to know them, you'll find more people you can trust. Who knows you have trust in another person who is not your best friend. So we all know that trust is a huge deal between two people, and more. You need to work together for trust. A good friendship or relationship can be established with anyone as long as there is trust between you. My friends and I have learned a lot from trusting each other in different ways.
The other day @CAPS17 I was having trouble trying to deal with some very big changes in @CAPS13's life and I enlisted the help of a friend. Usually @CAPS17 I have a bad day, I @CAPS14 keep it a secret to myself. This is @CAPS17 where I need someone else to help @CAPS2. @CAPS17 I went to @CAPS5 to meet @CAPS13 friend who tried her best to cheer @CAPS2 to no avail. @CAPS6 She said "@CAPS1 heard the story?" @CAPS2 wanted to hear anything that would get @CAPS2 out of this slump, and I was like "@CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS12 thought it would help." @CAPS5 @CAPS6 She started. “The other day @CAPS13 family @CAPS5 I went grocery shopping. We walked about four hours. I stopped her there @CAPS5 and asked her what it had to do with making @CAPS2 feel better @CAPS5 she said” The more detailed the more interesting. "I told her to go on. She went on, "@CAPS6 We got home @CAPS5 and parents started unloading groceries. When they do @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I'm in the living room teaching our dog how to sit, lie, rock, talk, and @CAPS5 roll over. Every time she plays tricks, we give her half a dog treat. @CAPS17 Parents put away their groceries and they walk into the living room @CAPS5 and we show them the tricks we taught our dogs they haven't seen yet. After we showed them all @CAPS13, dad had to say "@CAPS7 @CAPS3 @CAPS12 put dog treats in @CAPS6 she won't @CAPS11 get into them." I replied with a simple "@CAPS8". @CAPS6 parents say they'll be back for pizza because they don't want to' @CAPS11 want to cook after a long day of shopping, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they left. When they're gone @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I tidy up the living room @CAPS5 to continue training the dogs. @CAPS17 Parents are back we all sat @CAPS5 @CAPS5 started watching @CAPS11.V. @CAPS5 eat our pizza. After @CAPS5 @CAPS17 everyone is done and we are still in the living room @CAPS5 @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I heard @CAPS13 dad complain in the kitchen that they can’t find the cookies they @CAPS14 bought. I looked at @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 and said "@CAPS12 know what would be funny? @CAPS4 Dad thought dog treats were biscuits @CAPS5 ate one." @CAPS13 sister giggled. Our dad stomped into the living room @CAPS5 threw himself on the couch and acted like a 4 year old boy who got his game stolen by @CAPS14. We started laughing at @CAPS5, our dad looked at @CAPS5 and scolded us, then looked back at @LOCATION1. And then out of nowhere @CAPS15 said "I found them". Or @CAPS15 thinks it's them. @CAPS15 reaching for the dog treats on the coffee table. @CAPS13 Sister @CAPS5 I don't @CAPS11 dare to speak. We look at him. @CAPS15 watched @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 reach into dog treat bag @CAPS5 took out one. @CAPS15 looks at us @CAPS5 We look away for a split second. Then our eyes were fixed on him again, beyond our control. We @CAPS14 must watch. @CAPS15 look at @LOCATION1 again @CAPS5 put whole dog treat in mouth. @CAPS15 start chewing. Then @CAPS15 slowed his chewing @CAPS5 turned his head to one side, @CAPS14 was like a dog. What a coincidence. Then it sounds like @CAPS15 choked on a piece of it @CAPS5 @CAPS15 started coughing. @CAPS15 spat dog treats on the head of @CAPS13 mom sitting on the floor. @CAPS13 Sister @CAPS5 I started laughing uncontrollably. @CAPS13 Dad is @CAPS14, sitting on the couch with a stern face and I swear we can see the smoke coming out of his ears. @CAPS15 starts shouting how we should treat dogs @CAPS6 This won't happen to '@CAPS11 but mid-sentence, @CAPS15 @CAPS14 can't' @CAPS11 help it out. @CAPS15 starts laughing. @CAPS6 we all laughed and then we looked at @CAPS13 mom still sitting on the floor still shocked because she was sprayed with chewed dog food. We can stop laughing, @CAPS6 and she starts laughing. "@CAPS17 She told @CAPS2 this story @CAPS5 laughed @CAPS6 if I cried. Then I realized "@CAPS12 just needs a little laugh to brighten your life." "
Are you afraid of falling off a cliff when you are on the mountain? I have, I do have that experience. This is @DATE1 @TIME2 @PERSON1 where we just got off. I got all my gear out of the storage room under the bus @PERSON1 heading to the ramp. We lace up our boots @PERSON1 and head to the elevator for a chair. That year my friends @PERSON1, @PERSON1 all three of us joined the school's snowboard team. The three of us grabbed a chair and climbed to the top of the track. The air is so fresh and the @PERSON1 snow is a fresh layer of powder. We are all so excited to be part of the perfect @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @TIME1 is the same old habit as we go downhill. So my friend @PERSON1 and I suggested that it's time for us to take some new paths. They agreed, so we went to the new area @TIME1. This is a good trail with lots of jumps @PERSON1 lots of powder. It seemed like a perfect boarding area. We all like it very much. But when the trail got a little narrow, we realized it was coming to an end, and then suddenly, there was a drop in front of us. I moved my plank aside so I could stop, but it didn't help. I hit a block of ice, @PERSON1 didn't work. I can't stop. I fell and @PERSON1 was ready for the shock. I was thinking that I was going to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily my board was the first to hit the rock, illuminating the cool @TIME1 with sparks. I slid a few more feet across the snow, trying to stop myself. When I stopped, I looked back and wondered how I survived. I was worried my friends would do the same, but they stopped in time. We can't believe what just happened. I learned from @TIME1, always identify the area before you browse it. Luckily I wasn't injured, I may have been seriously injured.
Laugh, everyone from babies to seniors does it. Laughter is a helpful element in life. They say "laughter is the best medicine" and it is. Laughing lets people know that you have a great sense of humor and that you enjoy having fun and relaxing. In any friendship, relationship, job, or sport, you need to laugh every now and then. You can't always be serious. Seriously as they say @NUM1 is bad, it makes people look like they don't know how to enjoy life or that they don't have a sense of humor. I had a tough volleyball season on @DATE1. A lot of my teammates have a problem with me because I was voted captain along with my friend @PERSON1. We are not the most liked, but we are liked by some. It's hard for @PERSON1 and I to prove that we're fit to be captains and that we can lead the team. Some of my teammates backed out at the time because they didn't want to deal with @PERSON1 and I was the captain, but when they dropped out, we moved people from junior varsity to varsity. The new varsity members had a hard time, they struggled a bit trying to get the hang of it, but they did, they managed to get the hang of the varsity game and practice. We had our first game shortly after the unfortunate incident where we had to replace 7 out of 14 players. This game was the toughest game we've had all season. In our first set, we didn't fully consider the first set of five sets. We played a few points back and forth in the first set, but we ended up losing the first set. We went into the second set not knowing if what we were going to do was give up or give up - @CAPS1 it was tough, I as one of the captains said "@CAPS1 we're going to get nothing unless we @CAPS1." Then @PERSON1 said "I agree , let @CAPS1 do their best, don't let them win easily." We did exactly what we did and we won the second set. It was the third set and we were starting to get tired and irritated, so we moved forward and we won the third set. One more set and we won. We get on the field, the ball is sent, we let the ball hit the ground and hit the other team. After the first point it went downhill and we let them get the best of us and they won the game. It's the fifth and final set, and we either win or lose. We got on the field, knew we might lose, and started. The first point was given to us, and we went back and forth a ton in the final. It was an uphill battle, but we did it and we won. We ran into this team again late in the season and it was an easy fight we lost the second time we ran into them it wasn't easy at all and they didn't allow any room for error to represent them but we Make everything slippery. Time to get to the state finals. We're on a team that we've played against twice before, we're one-on-one. Call the lineup, sing the national anthem, toss a coin, receive a serve. The game was in full swing, we did well, we won the first set by four points and it was a tough first game. We got into the second set and we lost control. We are not doing what we should be doing. We lost the second set and were confident hitters. We lost, we didn't know what to expect in the third game, as captains, seeing as @PERSON1 and my team shouldn't let ourselves down. We looked at each other with the kind of eyes I know and we just laughed and we couldn't stop the team from wondering what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win we have to laugh, we @MONTH1 are frustrated but you have to laugh, did the team go into the third set as confidently as ever, we won, we didn't stop there, we entered The fourth set was set and won. We have done what we want to win! In the end, laughing is what we need to do, and we've gotten to the point where we can give up or push and succeed. We looked at the two games we had met each other before and laughed. We developed our team motto, "Laugh until you cry, cry until you laugh," and it's been great to look back on this season when we were state champions. Now in the @DATE2 season, we hope to repeat the state championship.
Laughter is an important part of a relationship. Laughter once saved my best friend's relationship with his girlfriend. They just got into the biggest fight I've ever seen. The quarrel started over a small thing that they couldn't even remember what it was. The fight snowballed until they didn't know what they were fighting for. Then one day, when they were taking a break from the fight, we went to see a funny movie. After watching the movie for a while, I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, my friend and his girlfriend were smiling. I asked them what was funny, but they didn't tell me. @CAPS4 Movies we went to eat at @CAPS1 restaurant. When we were seated, my friend muttered something I couldn't hear his girlfriend and she burst out laughing. I asked again what was funny and they said nothing. At dinner @CAPS1 the food was great and my friend girlfreind got up to go to the bathroom. @CAPS4 She couldn't hear and my friend turned to me and said, "@CAPS3 will never believe what just happened. I don't have a fight with her anymore. @CAPS4 @CAPS3 left to go to the bathroom and I asked if she could remember we were in arguing what she said she didn't know, just arguing because she didn't want to lose the argument. @CAPS4 she said I was frank and said I was arguing for the same reason. It made us laugh so hard because we were all aware of it The argument might have ended before that night." @CAPS4 I almost never hear of them fighting again. It wasn't until she moved out of state that they had another argument. The point of contention is that he wants to have a long-distance relationship, but she doesn't. Since laughter saved their relationship for a while, I firmly believe that laughter is an important part of a relationship. It also serves as a great icebreaker for conversations.
@CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2! Lol, you need it to survive in this world. Someone should laugh at least ten times a day. Have you heard that frowning takes more muscle than smiling? Well, I believe this is true. Happiness is more convenient than sadness. According to me. On @DATE2, my family lives in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1. Before my brother and I were born, my mom and dad had @NUM1 baby girls. It's a beautiful snowy morning at @DATE1...Christmas! My sister @PERSON1 is wearing a bright yellow dress and @CAPS13 is delighted to receive a gift and cake! @CAPS6 As soon as she turns on the big battery powered monster truck, her beautiful clear blue eyes are the size of watermelons! @PERSON1 walked steadily over and climbed into the big truck. Just one problem, @CAPS6 can't get to the pedals. Everyone stood there and said nothing...then they started laughing as @PERSON1 awkwardly looked like @CAPS6 was dancing in the truck as @CAPS6 tried to step on the pedals. Then my mom said, "@CAPS3 someone should go and help @PERSON1 get on the truck." @CAPS4 This is probably the worst idea ever! My @CAPS2 is @NUM2 years old, about @NUM3 pounds, and not in top shape. @CAPS6 angrily said, "@CAPS5 I will help @PERSON1." @CAPS6 rolled off the couch and stood next to @PERSON1 and the truck. My dad was giggling backstage. My @CAPS2 seriously said, "I need a stick or something to push the "start" pedal. @CAPS6 went outside and found a long stick in the snow. They decided they should try it outside because @PERSON1 Want to feel the cold wind on @CAPS6's baby's soft face as she rides the truck. @CAPS13 My mom bundles @PERSON1 in @NUM1 jackets, gloves and beanies. Somehow they climbed up where we live The @NUM5ft snowy, slippery summit. My @CAPS2 hit the 'start' pedal and it moved forward @CAPS4, the front tire got stuck in her maxi dress @CAPS6 was wearing and knocked her down! Next thing we know, @CAPS6 is rolling down the hill screaming her lungs! Just then her red floral dress is flying and we can see her pincers. My sister exclaimed: "This is disgusting @CAPS2! " @CAPS9 just some minor bruises and scratches, my @CAPS2 is @CAPS5. That's @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2! I watched it in a @CAPS11 video. We @MONTH1 take this video Put it on "@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12". @CAPS13 If you see it remember me chuckling in the back of her head. @CAPS13 Remember you should always laugh or laugh not frown or get angry. LOL , is the key to a happy life!
Laughter @CAPS1 brings enthusiasm and joy to any way or thing. Have you ever thought that laughter is a part or key element of a relationship? The time laughter really helped or built a relationship was when I met one of my best friends who is still today. I just started fifth grade at a new school; I moved from private to public. I only knew a few people there due to family reasons, and these were my cousins. As you can imagine, I sit next to someone I've known for most of my life, and it's very awkward to be in this position. So, finally at the end of the day, I was ready to leave school and it was the first time I walked home because the school was so much closer than the one I went to. I had to walk home with a kid who lived next to me; something I never knew because of my sheltered young life. Fortunately, he's easy to talk to, and we all have something in common, which is skateboarding. This is when we started @CAPS1 as we talked about some not-so-pleasant falls and he asked if we could hang out after school and being a shy guy, I said yes. After a while he came over with his skateboard and he told me to come down the slope I had. So, I did it and fell on my back and we both thought it was fun and we started @CAPS1 together. This @CAPS1 we've done since walking home has really made me feel comfortable with him and kind of like us. I think fall is a key part of our friendship because it takes the embarrassment away and helps us start talking about more interesting things we've seen. Since then, every time we hang out, something happens and we laugh as much as we can and it becomes a good time in our memory. @CAPS1 Always "make the mood sweet", so to speak, always make good times a good time to remember, or a really boring time to be a "let's do something" time. Also, in any case, when I become @CAPS1 or start laughing, I feel good because everyone laughs when I laugh. Most of my friends are my friends too because of my laughter and when I make them laugh. All in all, most of the relationships I've had are because of @CAPS1 and how they consoled two or more people by connecting them and making everyone feel like they were having a good time with each other. This is key because even friends can be very awkward or unpleasant compared to most human encounters. So, @CAPS1 is really necessary in any case because everything gets boring and you really don't have anyone to have a good time with. So every time I meet someone new, even someone I know, I need laughter to be in a relationship with anyone.
A lot of people always say that a sense of humor is very important when looking for a significant other, or even a friend. @CAPS4 Some people don't realize how much laughter @CAPS1 brings people together! I now know that as long as two people have a good laugh together, they can be good friends. My best friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 are my friends through @CAPS1. I went to elementary school with my aunt @LOCATION1 my whole life. We are only two years apart so we can usually stay in the same @ORGANIZATION1 so I never feel alone. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 ended up going to a different @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 than me. I'm going to have to face @ORGANIZATION1 myself. My first year at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and I was nervous. This is my first big @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has moved and I don't know anyone so I'm shy. In one of my classes, I easily made my first friend. @CAPS3. @PERSON4, teacher, wish we had a partner so we could do a certain exercise together. @PERSON2 and I both chose each other for some reason, I don't know how, @CAPS4 We are drawn to each other. @PERSON4 told us we would do a "mirror exercise". We chose one person to be the facilitator and one person to be the mirror. @PERSON2 ended up being the enabler. I had to follow her exactly so @PERSON4 couldn't tell who the mirror was, @CAPS4 We all laughed when @PERSON2 started acting like a monkey, @PERSON4 even laughed. At lunch, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friend @PERSON1. @CAPS2 claims to have known her for years. @PERSON1 and I smiled at each other, @CAPS4 we didn't really talk at all. When my last class of the day comes, I'm ready to go home, @CAPS5 Since this is a @CAPS6 class, I've never really liked @CAPS6. I'm here to discover me and the <@NUM1 we already know! </@CAPS7> @CAPS8 shared that class and @PERSON2 as a friend and we sat together. We still don't have much to say, though. Days passed and we still didn't really talk, we @CAPS1 sat awkwardly next to each other. Meanwhile, @PERSON2 and I became even closer friends, doing silly skits together amidst @CAPS3 class laughter brought us together, @CAPS4 I didn't really notice because it was with me most of the time The way it is made is no different friends. One day we had a test in @CAPS6 class and we had to go to the computer lab. @PERSON1 and I chose adjacent computers and we silently started our tests, as usual. Then all of a sudden @CAPS2 turned to me and asked if I'd heard of "@CAPS11 @CAPS12". @CAPS2 sang this song for me when I was very shocked to answer no, right in the middle of the computer lab. When @CAPS2 ended, we both started laughing so hard that it hurt. Our teacher warned us to keep quiet and we restarted the test with a smile on our face. After that moment, everything changed! Like magic, @PERSON1 and I have been joking! @PERSON2 noticed the change, @CAPS2 was glad we got along well, @CAPS4 wondered what caused the sudden difference. To this day, @PERSON1 and I share laughter whenever we have time. Even though I'm busy with babysitting, @ORGANIZATION1 and my job. When @CAPS2 went to college, nothing stopped the connections we made that day through laughter! I learned that laughter is the first foundation of any relationship. @CAPS4 It's not unique. You also need to have trust. If you can't trust someone, @CAPS4 they're humorous, but that doesn't make them good friends. You also need to feel safe. If your friend encourages you to do something that makes you uncomfortable, they are not great friends. I know @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 are my best friends. Laughter brings us together and I know it will bring us together for generations!
@CAPS11 is @DATE1, hot and dry for miles without seeing any @CAPS26. We've been walking @CAPS18 for six hours eating leftover jerky bits. @PERSON3 didn't say much today, still pissed about dropping the can, I'd laugh if our lives didn't depend on the can. In the scorching sun that day, not even a grain of sand was heard moving over the lifeless dry soil. There is no wind. I look up to see the sun at the peak of @CAPS11, but @CAPS11 feels like weeks have passed. Finally plucking up the courage to open my blood-stained, wrinkled lips, I managed to spit out something, "@CAPS1 sounds good now, @CAPS3, don't you think?" @CAPS2 didn't even look at me, I don't know @CAPS2 Is it @CAPS18 ignoring me or @CAPS2 getting so sunburnt that his skin will tear @CAPS18 turning his head. "@CAPS3 won't let me start singing, you know how bad I sing. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singing to her." I started chuckling. "@CAPS4 So I'm going to die myself? To make things better?" @PERSON3 finally said, his neck surprisingly still intact. "@CAPS5 is not bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine @CAPS31 has whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, do you?" I asked, kicking a stone. “@CAPS4 did I start riding with you and them, @CAPS18 should stay at home and become a lawyer and at least make a name for herself.” @CAPS2 murmured looking away. “@CAPS8 you did it, now we can move on, or you can just keep going back and get lynched. Maybe ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2 for the bodies behind the rocks and remind you again @CAPS9 will be back like that ." I stared into the distance with nothing to see but a little brown dot can't tell what @CAPS9 @CAPS11 is. "You think it's @CAPS9?" @PERSON3 asked. "@CAPS10 Some dead animals." @CAPS11 It's been hours since we talked, and the brown spot gets bigger as we get closer. I still can't be sure @CAPS9 @CAPS11 is, but I know @CAPS9 I hope @CAPS11 is. My boots started to wear out a few years ago and now have a big hole and my big toe can't help sticking out. "We're not jerky anymore, we're all gone." @PERSON3 muttered as @CAPS2 threw the sack over his shoulder. "@CAPS9 do you still think so?" @CAPS2 spat. “@CAPS3 no idea, but @CAPS11 is huge, @CAPS29 the sun is very hot, I think @CAPS11 has some nice shade under @CAPS11.” @CAPS11 is close to dusk, but is now about a mile away from @CAPS11, this point has become very large. "It's getting dark at @CAPS11, how do we go to see where we're stepping?" @PERSON3 asked to observe every step. “@CAPS17 is hard to walk without looking.” “@CAPS18 thinks @CAPS11 is like @CAPS19’s donkey’s tail, but has to walk to the donkey blindfolded.” “@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knows how to get through a party, hers Pie is very good." @PERSON3 begins to fantasize. Now, with my arms outstretched, I know if we're on target. I pulled my big toe back out of the hole to avoid hitting @CAPS11 on a rock. All of a sudden, I heard a loud bang, and then I felt a little steady, "I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11," @PERSON3 said slowly, and I now realize @CAPS9 was a bang. “@CAPS21 is an abandoned jeep.” “@CAPS9 Are we going to do it with @CAPS11?” @PERSON3 asked. "@CAPS23." @CAPS24 On the front seat doors, the cushioning is firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. When I woke up, another hellish sun in the sky was almost laughing at us. There are several compartments on the jeep and I started searching for @CAPS26. "@CAPS9 are you looking for it?" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slipped out of the jeep. "@CAPS26, @CAPS9 other?" @CAPS27 Scrolling through the dusty old papers, I managed to find a hard piece of gum, a cigar head and half an empty bottle @CAPS9, I hope it's @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I've filled that bottle with @CAPS26. Whiskey is all I @CAPS28 has in the bottle. Coming out of the dirty car, I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 on the front tire. "@CAPS28 some of your favorite drinks," I said, leaning against the door. "@CAPS29, did you find it?" @PERSON3 muttered. "@CAPS30." I stared at the horizon, nothing but sand. "I'm scarred, you're scarred?" @PERSON3 asked, looking at me. “The thing @CAPS31 scares me is that @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 finds out I’m eating her pie before dinner,” I begin to chuckle. "@CAPS20, it's true," laughs @PERSON3 as @CAPS2 wipes the sweat from her brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days with @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 is an awesome guy, @CAPS11 sorry I brought him into all @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of heat stroke. That desert is unforgiving and the @CAPS11 is something I must always carry.
Laughing is like feeling alive and nothing else matters, letting go of the pain in your life and feeling that all is well. You laugh when things are funny, and sometimes even when they're not, maybe to make others feel better, or just to relax. When someone tells you a joke and it's hilarious, do you sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the floor and laugh? I personally fell to the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best time, and when you laugh, it lightens the mood a little and reduces tension in the environment. I've been happy many times by laughing at the stupidest things we do or the dumbest things we do, and making them less bad by laughing at it. My friends and I have been adventuring since 3rd grade. We got lost on the walk, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we took her quads to the sandy track, we jumped over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we go on comes with laughter and a huge story to tell friends and family. After all this adventure and growth, you seem to have lost interest, but you will never forget the good times you had. Let me tell you a great time, I laughed so hard I even started crying. When your kids think things are @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they are, or things are @CAPS1 higher @CAPS3 they are, but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1, we loved playing outdoors, climbing trees, burying old treasures to grow up, and spying on our neighbors. Well on this special day @PERSON1 and I choose to "watch" the neighbors. We like to do this because they have kids, animals and lots of cars so they are outside of A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad has about ten tires right next to their fence, so normally we'd stand on them and add toes just for a peek, but this time we felt it was clear we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, And more secretive. Finally @PERSON1's dad went to work and he was away for a long time so we had things to prepare. We thought of every possible way to view the fence, from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after thinking about it for a while, we had the perfect idea to climb into the trash can and sit and watch them. As brave as I am, I volunteered to make sure it would work first so that @ORGANIZATION1 could try it when I was done. Don't climb on the trash can next to the wooden fence, things won't happen the way you expect. when i climbed to the top of the trash can it started shaking and i was scared so i grabbed the top of the fence but the problem was i pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and i grabbed Live the fence and leave the worst bruised hands I've ever seen. After our crazy adventure, I needed something to cool my hands quickly because they were burning. So we wanted to look through the first aid kit to see her dad's cart, but we were there and I noticed a little fan hanging next to the radio, so I turned it on and put my hand in front of it for half an hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what happened and I thought about it all and couldn't stop laughing and it made me cry because I laughed so hard. I wouldn't have the friendship we have today without the laughter of @PERSON1. Laughter is the main source of friendship I feel. All the adventures that @PERSON1 and I share, they wouldn't be the same if they didn't laugh in hindsight. You can look back at things and say, "@CAPS2 really sucks." Or you can look at things and say, "That's funny." @CAPS3 Laugh tells you to cry. I can see that laughter is the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and make fun of them, it helps you be who you are without having to pretend you are someone else. If friendships were built without laughter, I don't know if they would be as good, at least I know some of them definitely wouldn't.
Laughing comforting. Many different comforts can come from laughter. My story is the comfort of love. @CAPS6 I'm a young and stupid teenager. (@CAPS1 wait, this is how I am today.) A few days ago, my friend @CAPS2 made me laugh so hard, all because @CAPS5 slipped while meeting my mother. (@CAPS2 was nervous to see my mom.) For some reason @CAPS6 I started laughing @CAPS5 suddenly started acting like everything was fine and nothing to be nervous about. @CAPS7 The latter @CAPS6 We went for a walk and I asked him about it. I just said "@CAPS4 did your mood change @CAPS6 I started laughing?" @CAPS5 replied with a smile: "@CAPS6 you laughed and I feel so at peace knowing I'll be fine." @CAPS7 myself A typical teenage girl, I blushed, @CAPS7 quickly changed the subject while trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly, I couldn't help myself. The feel of his eyes on my cheek made me not want to look. Turning his head slowly, sure enough @CAPS5 stared straight into my eyes, his eyes are very beautiful, reminds me of sunflowers in the blue sky behind me. When @CAPS5 looked back, I had a feeling like @CAPS5 was trying to unravel everything about me and everything I knew with his eyes. Seems like @CAPS5 can look straight into my soul. I quickly turned to leave. @CAPS5 makes you laugh out loud with a soft, almost beautiful voice. This laughter is as sweet to my ears as nectar is to a hummingbird. How hard are the next few days. All I can think of is that walk. People must think I'm crazy, every time I remember walking, every time I remember his laughter. @CAPS7 Made myself smile. @CAPS7 I realize that laughter plays an important role in everyone's life. For me, I laugh @CAPS6 I am with the people I love. For something they find funny watching TV, or maybe having kids doing something pretty stupid. So stupid you have to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is everywhere. Laughing is never a bad thing, in fact it has been proven to have many health benefits. Some people don't understand. There is no shame in laughing, if someone laughs at you, laugh with them. It wasn't laughter that started the war. It's not laughter that kills. Those who choose not to fill it live with laughter. So this is the goal. Laughter is also contagious. So try to laugh with @CAPS8. Do something @CAPS6 people remember and they'll start their laughter from there. Laughter - @CAPS8 Come on!
The benefits of laughter We all know the benefits of laughter, it's the shortest distance between two people, many people @CAPS1 We're going to tell you specifically how laughter works in a brotherhood that has so many good times because of it. Well actually, I know that my brother and I had the best time when we were laughing and joking. It seemed that laughter made us have the best relationship a brother could have, and we had a great time. What we're going to discuss next is the power of laughter in families and boy-girlfriend relationships. Think the way it works in family relationships is that families get together and talk about the past and laugh about things that's how it was when they were kids. Seeing the power of laughter brings families closer. In a relationship like a boy and a girlfriend, that's how I see it. If a boy can't make a girl laugh, a boy should never talk to a girl. I know girls love to laugh and have fun with friends and guys. So how do guys make girls laugh so you can have fun and show that you're not afraid to talk to girls. Well, how do I see it let's move on. Well, I've talked about brotherhood and family and boys and girlfriends, so now let's talk about friendship. I think people like friends who can make them laugh and have a good time with them. That's the kind of friend kined people want to have, and that's the kind of friend I have and love. Well, let's move on to the last part. Well, now you see the benefits of laughter in brotherhood, family, friends, boy and girlfriend relationships. Well, in my opinion, in the way I think it works, yes, @MONTH1 doesn't think it's the way I do it or the way I see it, but that's life, that's my life. Hope you like the way I write these words in my story, see you next time.
Laughter is a sign of a good relationship. For some, it's a sign of personality, a sign of love, and a sign that you care about someone. To me, laughter makes people so unique. Everyone has a different laugh. For example, @CAPS2 had a lot of laughter when you were a baby. The older you get, the less @CAPS2 laughs, "like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1". If it weren't for his laughter, it wouldn't be him. When I was a kid, I remember trying to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1. I'll be walking around the house trying to get my laughter really @CAPS1. My family though it was the best thing ever. They will ask me to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 so they can laugh too. Now, today my laugh is what I want it to be, "@CAPS1". It's hard for me to laugh quietly now. I've had some people tell me things like; "@CAPS2 laugh is I'll remember you" or "@CAPS2 laugh is really something else". I love my laughter because it's part of me. You, me, or anyone else wouldn't be who they are without laughter. Laughter is a way of expressing emotion. So go ahead and try different laughs. No matter what, you can't change the one you were supposed to have.
In my story, I'll tell you a funny time in my life when my brother and I loved to play pranks on my aunt. @CAPS1 The first paragraph is about our first prank on my aunt. When I was about six and my brother was four and my aunt just bought a beautiful purple sofa and she loved the @CAPS1 sofa, my brother and I thought my aunt loved the @CAPS1 sofa more than she loved We. So my brother and I took two jars of chocolate syrup and sprinkled them on my aunt's brand new three thousand dollar couch. The second prank was myself, one day I was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. I was so frustrated with the game that I threw the controller down and my aunt ran over and flicked me on the back of my head and she told me to be a good sport and try again. But I was frustrated because the back of my head popped out so I was looking for revenge and when my aunt went to the bathroom and put on her sign - @CAPS3 to work I went into the kitchen and got a grape soda and I walked to In front of my aunt's purse, I opened the grape soda and broke the contents of my aunt's purse. The last paragraph is about the worst prank my brother and I have ever done. One morning, Auntie was at work, Dad was sleeping, my brother and I were sitting on the couch watching TV, and my brother said he had to go to the bathroom, knowing our kids, we did everything together, so my brother and I went to @CAPS3 stairs to the bathroom, we watched to the largest box, containing fifty-four rolls of soft, lush toilet paper. My brother and I love to roll toilet paper for whatever reason so we opened the box and my brother dropped one in the toilet so I put one in the toilet and he put the other in the toilet and then I rinse it. Little did we know it would react against us and the toilet started overflowing, but I kept flushing. Then I took another roll and started unrolling it on the floor, my brother got one, @DATE1 We were knee deep in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt went through the front door and we weren't here because we had a lot of fun with toilet paper and water, then she came to @CAPS3 stairs and also went to the bathroom and saw me and my brother and the bathroom was beaten and full Toilet paper and water. But the only thing she said to us was. Clean @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! She slammed the door and my brother and I looked at each other and started cleaning. Finally, after hours of cleaning, the bathroom is back to what it should be. @CAPS1 is the conclusion to a story about three of the worst pranks my brother and I played on our aunts.
Being with family and friends on an unforgettable trip always seems to bring a smile. There's always a time to look back; whether it's good memories, or nostalgic thoughts. I'm graduating soon and my parents just told me we're going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the end of the year. We have a date set; @DATE1, just after school. My first reaction was to plead that my best friend would travel with us. My parents took the time to think through all the pros and cons and responded quickly and affirmatively. I'm glad to know that the memories I'm about to create with my closest family members now include my best friend. The first thing is first, I have to start a business. I need to call my friend @PERSON1 and ask her if she would like to come along. Selfishly assuming her immediate response would be an exuberant "@CAPS1!" I was first devastated by @CAPS4 when she delayed her response and @CAPS6 seemed too excited. I haven't considered the fact that @MONTH1 has some kind of misunderstanding by @CAPS6. She discussed it with her mother and called me back. I made the mistake of not telling her that we would provide her with financial security for airfare, meals and a hotel room. We cleaned everything up and they decided she @CAPS3 would join us. If we tried, the two of us together could' @CAPS6 be more ecstatic! @PERSON1 and I made a countdown board about two months from our departure date. When planning, we take many factors into consideration. When we figured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts and shops we would visit. Our family friend was staying at @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 so she showed us around the island. Having such an acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more interesting. She knows all the local hangouts and has access to military beaches because she works at @ORGANIZATION1! We used to have a lot of humor on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened at the hotel where I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom always had a way to liven up every situation, so it was awesome when we went out on girls night. First, and the most important of our adventures, we went shopping at the mall attached to the hotel. There are many different small clothing stores, food stores and jewelry stores. One of our favorite shops we visited was the @CAPS6 shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent a lot of time looking at all of @CAPS4's designs and I think we ended up spending the night with a wave of cocoa. As soon as we finished our downtown shopping assignment, we went back to our room, laughing and engaging in pointless girl talk. Smiling and sore feet, the three of us girls walked up the elegant, ornately designed gold elevator with new bags. My mom pushes the button to take us to our floor while @PERSON1 goes on about our plans the night before. We were engrossed in our conversation, dragging new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we don't have a key card to open our room's door @CAPS6, the three of us decided to knock on the door and my dad would answer. "@CAPS2 should be back from renting our surfboards now, so why didn't @CAPS6 @CAPS2 answer?" We thought, "Is @CAPS3 @CAPS2 still on the beach?" @CAPS4 This, when we try to figure it out What to do when our conversation died down a bit. I texted my dad's phone and @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up knocking on the door for a full five minutes, assuming @CAPS2 was kidding us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in chaotic silence, I began to notice a low humming sound coming from the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS3 couldn't help laughing. That's when it hit me and I said to both of them, "@CAPS5 guys! We didn't '@CAPS6 leave @CAPS6.V.!" We stopped the intrusion immediately and got out of the door as fast as @CAPS3 , keep laughing. My mom pressed the wrong floor button on the elevator! We're so preoccupied with having a good time that we don't even realize we're bothering people and embarrassing ourselves! '@CAPS6 was just a moment or a trip, now it's the joy of a lifetime because I can look back on those memories and smile at @CAPS4. It is these moments that I cherish the most.
Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, two powerful and important things in life in themselves. There was a time not so long ago that I could turn a girl's tears into laughter and make her day better. It all started with the craze in today's teen world, "@CAPS1". For those who don't know, this is a website where teens spend a lot of time and people communicate through this site. I logged in and saw that this girl I liked was logged in too, so I started talking to her. Normal teenage conversation, "@CAPS2, what's wrong?" This kind of thing happened, and she asked me if I could hang out. Now, let me know if I'm wrong, but most guys hang out if it's a girl they like. I went to meet her at the library and she was as beautiful as ever, although I doubt she was trying. She seemed upset when I approached her, but when I asked her what was bothering her, she didn't want to tell me. I don't want to make things worse, so I leave it alone. All I could do was what I could do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, wondering if that would help. Fortunately, it did help and she started smiling. After a while, I made her laugh and had a good time. Since that day, we have been dating, and we are really happy. Every day I see her, I just say a few words to make her laugh.
Elements of @CAPS1 and Laughter A Laughter is an important element a person may have in a happy or happy mood. Laughter is a good part of a person's life; when you appreciate something other people do, it shows others that it puts you in a good mood to laugh. Some people respond to laughter differently because of their emotions; others laugh at hilarious jokes, other types laugh at people's accidents, and others don't. Emotions are a major event in a person's life. Some emotions are joy, sadness, jealousy, fear or anger. Happiness makes one want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much, they actually cry because of it. People like everyone else @CAPS4 are in a happy or happy mood because then they can also feel those good feelings; so keeping more people positive will also make others happy. Another thing that makes people laugh is jokes. Some jokes can be funny, some can be disgusting, and some are really hilarious and you'll remember them forever. But jokes can sometimes get complicated. You can say to a kid, "@CAPS2, @CAPS2!" "Is @CAPS4 there?" "@CAPS5." "@CAPS5 @CAPS4?" "@CAPS5 @CAPS4?, don't cry about it, it's just a joke ," the child would laugh. But for @CAPS4 older folks, you have to think a little more to make them laugh. People love to laugh; they love to laugh at people's jokes, especially hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. Like when you see a friend of yours getting something that spit out garlic and they know the person who is about to be pranked is allergic to garlic. But most of the time, fun things help people cheer up when they're feeling down. Also, accidents are sometimes very scary things, but at other times some accidents in life can be very funny to some people. Some accidents people can decide whether to go one way or the other. For example, one person might think that the other person was about to jump off the diving board but then slipped and hit the diving board and it was really funny, the other person might disagree and think the other way around Not funny. Like when someone says they're a really funny joke or something funny, you end up thinking it's a nuisance or a tragedy, or it could be the other way around. You might think you have something funny to say, but to your friend, it's something that really bothers them, or something they don't think is funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important element one may have in one's life. When someone needs to share a good laugh with another, this is the part where one can help the other. Enjoy a good time sharing laughter with your friends, don't always be in a bad mood, be happy. Laughter is good; people love it, so don't take it seriously all the time, at least share some laughter with your friends or loved ones.
Laughter Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable, bring two people together, or just show that you're having a good time. In my experience, laughter comes at the best of times. On a typical @ORGANIZATION1 day at @ORGANIZATION1, I was sitting with my friends at lunchtime talking about what's going on in our lives when I noticed a girl sitting alone. I don't know her, she must be a new student. I asked around to see if anyone knew about her; no one knew. Looking back at the girl, she looks lonely and needs a friend. Desperate to meet a new friend, I walked up to her and after a while we started talking and started talking about our interests. I remember her saying something funny and I started laughing and she started laughing at me almost hysterically and everyone thought it sounded ridiculous. In that moment, as I sat there laughing together, I realized that even though we only met ten minutes ago, it brought us together and brought us closer. Laughter makes life more enjoyable and joyful because you know it's amazing that you can share your whole life with someone you just met or with someone you know. It is the universal language that everyone should speak. Laughter is good for the heart.
At one point during the @CAPS1 vacation, they had a lot of snow on the ground. My cousin @CAPS2, brother @CAPS3 and I all got together to meet my grandparents. My brother @CAPS3 lives in @LOCATION2, my cousin @CAPS2, I live in @LOCATION1. So it wasn't hard to get our cousins together. We all got together to meet my grandparents, go snowmobiling together, and spend a few nights outside. By the time everyone got together and started heading out, it was late to go snowmobiling. We're all sad, but that's okay. We just watched the movie straight at @LOCATION3 and waited for the morning. Of course, once the morning came, it was cold to go out when we woke up. So we made a big breakfast and after breakfast we were all ready and sat there waiting for the weather to warm up before going out. It's finally afternoon! We all put on warm clothes and went out snowmobiles. We were all out and my grandpa had a snowmobile for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could use it to pull us from behind. My grandpa was on a snowmobile with our kids behind. My grandma only went with us once and then she got out of the car because my grandpa was going crazy and we were both hit by each other while he was driving. Then, once our kid was Grandpa's only kid on the hood, it started going really fast! I was the only one covered in snow, I looked like a snowman. So funny! My grandpa ran in and got my grandpa a camera so she could take some pictures. It took her a while to get them, though, because she's not good at taking pictures and isn't very good at taking pictures. Then, when she was done, we went back to the snowmobiles for the rest of the day. I literally looked like a snowman after our day's work. It was a fun day and it was fun for me to look like a snowman, but then I got really cold. We went in and while my grandma made hot chocolate for all of us, I walked over to the heater to warm up.
We're going to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat together in our team van. Our packed luggage and ski gear filled the roof of the vehicle and six other kids, taking up all the other empty seats. Our uncomfortable seating arrangement didn't seem to spoil our fun, and within five minutes of our road trip, the van burst into laughter as @PERSON1, likely a future comedian, started joking and just being himself as usual. Within the first five minutes of our drive, I could already say it was going to be a ski trip I'll always remember. The van drove to the hotel parking lot. My ski team will be here for the long weekend. With @TIME1 the sky darkened and I dragged our weary eyes along with the others, exhausted from the long drive. We unloaded our bags quickly and were all eager to jump into bed, needing a good rest and getting ready for our first ski race of the season. Soon, everyone went to sleep, knowing that it was almost five o'clock. The sun begins to rise over the mountains, signaling that it is time to get up. This is not the case for me. I've been out of bed for almost an hour and sitting in our van as we zip around each corner and head up the hill. It was game day and all my teammates and I were excited for the day ahead. Morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and checking out the course. I'm standing at the top of the mountain now, staring at the line ahead of me. I have to concentrate. While I had a lot of fun, it was time to focus and give it my all. The pressure is always there. I'm standing at the start now with the coach by my side and my friends watching and cheering for me. I hope it doesn't disappoint me. "@CAPS2 is ready," the officer said nervously, "@CAPS3!" I threw myself at the starting gate. I flew through every door, maintaining control and most importantly, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, and my ankles and knees tumbled with every turn. All went well until I climbed over the hill. As I slid over the rollers, my body was compressed and my knees were against my chest, throwing me off balance. I tried to get up and get back on my feet, but I couldn't. My skis came out from under me, causing me to be spit out of the track, land on my back, slide down the hill, desperate, fucked up. it's over. I sat in the snow, frustrated with my performance. I want a second chance that I won't get. @PERSON1, one of my teammates, walked up to me and sat in the snow next to me. My first thought was that he would say some cliché "good job" or "you'll do better next time". To my surprise, he told me a ridiculous joke. The corners of my mouth rose, trying to hold back the laughter, but without success, I burst out laughing. @PERSON1 sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately, I found myself in a much better mood. Before we @CAPS3 watch and cheer for our teammate, I smile and give him a quick "thank you". Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my grades ruin my weekend. The next day I did two stable rides with top scores that I would never have achieved if I had been frustrated with myself. I'm starting to realize that some days, with just a little smile, you can turn around on any given day. Laughter, which I find essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, the laughter on the mountain that day changed my character. Laughter can mean many different things to many different people, and laughter can be a special bond between people. Laughter can take away the seriousness or competitiveness of a situation, but it also brings us together. Languages vary from person to person, but everyone understands what laughter can do and laughter is universal.
Laughter Laughter's @CAPS1 seems to be pretty much the foundation of a relationship with friends, no laughter, no spark of interest in wanting to be someone's friend. When I think of laughter, I think of when I went to @ORGANIZATION1. Even @CAPS2 I had my worst day, I know the girls I played with on that team were like a second family to me, always available through what they said or did Do things that cheer me up. The underlying relationship between the @ORGANIZATION1 team became invisible; no one really knew how much we laughed together, or how much setbacks we built. Frustrated @MONTH1 sometimes beats us, but I can think of more memories lying on the grass laughing because a player's stupid decision turned out to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. I remember the first time I attended @ORGANIZATION1 practice, back in second grade @DATE1, playing with a lot of girls from different schools that I had never seen before. All the girls decided they wanted to see who was the best at playing @ORGANIZATION1 balls on their knees. It was my turn to try and when I hit it with my knee it hit the wrong place so it bounced back and hit my nose and it bleeds. I didn't know how to react, so I started laughing. At that time, a girl I had never met started laughing with me and came over and gave me a tissue. Believe it or not, the girl who gave me the tissue the first day became my best friend and has been ever since. The laughter that happened that day filled the distance between us. Since that day, we have never had the awkward silence of not knowing what we should say or do. Going into the fall of 4th grade, I just joined the @ORGANIZATION1 team @ORGANIZATION1 and all but a few are still playing with the same girls. I didn't know what to think about those people or what to say, so I decided to say nothing. We've been playing monkeys among us, and I'm guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS3 who's very talented, but a little clumsy. She had already started running to grab the ball, looking down at the clumsy girl who stumbled on nothing! Thoughts are racing through my head; should I laugh? Will she hate me @CAPS2 Will I? @CAPS2 Is she really hurt? While these ideas from @MONTH1 came to fruition, I still laughed instinctively. She rolled over to see who started laughing at her unexpected trip, and she started laughing too. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we went to the same school but never contacted each other. From that day on, we were inseparable at school and became best friends. The next story is not about @ORGANIZATION1 but about laughter. While there is no specific story to tell you what happened between this girl and me, all I can say is that she gave me my first laugh-to-cry-to-cry experience. I remember her moving to our school and I was no longer the "new girl". At first I thought she was the weirdest person I've ever met, but over time I've found her @MONTH1 to be one of the funniest people I've ever met. @CAPS2 I would realize beforehand that this girl has her personality and I would walk up to her in a heartbeat and make friends instead of hiding behind a crowd. Our friendship has been based on how much we laughed together since we were friends, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Finally, the man who once said that "laughing is the shortest distance between two people" is absolutely right. I use these stories above to show that no matter how shy or embarrassed the people at @MONTH1 are, sharing a laugh with a new friend is the easiest way to find a best friend. When these three introduced me to laughter, I started to become more social throughout middle school and now into my high school career. @CAPS2 I would live a life without laughter, I would lose the life I had, would be full of dull memories not worth sharing, and for me, it was definitely not worth it. I've made three good friends over six years from laughter, which really shows that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, @CAPS1 who really owns it.
Laughter is part of my daily life. I always laugh at school or at home. Laughter can express many emotions that cannot be expressed in words. For me, it's also a way to show how lucky you are in life. I have many occasions where laughter is the solution to my problems. I also agree that laughter is an important part of a relationship. In the next paragraphs, I'll discuss how laughter has affected my relationship and the benefits it brings. About three months ago, my family and I decided to head to @LOCATION2. We plan to stay there for a month or so. When I told my boyfriend I was going away for a month, I immediately saw the sadness in his eyes. However, it really killed me, we made a decision and there is no turning back. Our relationship was strained that month. We talked a few times, but his voice was different. There was a sadness that I knew something was wrong. Although he said everything was fine, I knew his sadness was due to my absence. The month is finally over and it's time to get back to @LOCATION3! I'm really excited. We arrived @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 at @TIME1 on @DATE1 @TIME2. I called him right away but didn't get a chance to see him at @TIME2. Although, just knowing I'm closer to him makes me happy and anxious. We chatted for hours, telling each other that we would never be that far again. We laughed and laughed throughout our conversation. To me, his laughter was a sign of his happiness, and that was priceless. Laughter seemed like a blessing to our relationship. From that day on, I realized how much laughter affects me in so many ways. As if it brought happiness and prosperity to my life. Just smile and sadness leaves, that's when happiness jumps in.
I went out with my friend @CAPS1 a few months ago. That was @DATE1 and I came to see her for @TIME1. We were very bored at first, so we went for a walk to find something to do. We found our friend Dylan at the skate park and we stopped to talk to him for a while. After we were hanging out there for about two hours, we went back to her house. When we opened the door, her sister started freaking out because we were leaving, so she was stuck with brother @PERSON1 there. @CAPS1 didn't shout back, she doesn't want this drama. Her sister was even more angry because Jessica didn't react to what her sister did. Ten minutes later, she exploded and started running around, freaking out. Me and @CAPS1 looked at each other and literally laughed so hard because her sister looked funny. @TIME1 @CAPS1 and I made a @CAPS3 bed on the floor of her bedroom after her mom calmed down and we all burst out laughing as we fell asleep, it was the funniest I've had in a long time @ TIME1. (:
Alive, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter @CAPS4 to this @DATE1 I don't remember exactly why I laughed. All I can remember is the look on my grandfather's face in my mind. When he was happy, he always had the same smile. It's a warm smile that shines on you every now and then. When I laugh uncontrollably @DATE1, his happiness to me @CAPS1 shone so long so many years ago that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his smile. My @CAPS16, we all call him @CAPS5, has a way to keep @CAPS1 at peace in all things. No matter how bad things are in our family, he will make it right. No one gets mad @CAPS3 @CAPS5, @CAPS1 No one stays sad when he smiles. He is such a person. @CAPS5 is a big part of our family gatherings, just like our gatherings on @DATE1 @DATE1 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. That @DATE1 was our family's @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5, and he passed away shortly after. When I look back on @CAPS1 and realize the importance of @DATE1, I can see it's perfect for everyone @CAPS8. It's a happy @DATE1 @CAPS1 My @DATE1's memory of my @CAPS16 is his big happy smile shining on me as I giggled at a card game. The weather has proven spectacular as @CAPS8 starts early in the morning. Everyone in my family is in high spirits @CAPS1 ready to enjoy the @DATE1 @CAPS3 family. My favorite activity in every @CAPS1 every family activity is everyone playing my favorite game @CAPS3. There are certain games in our house that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is @CAPS12 - @CAPS13. Now @CAPS12 - @CAPS13 is one of the many games my @CAPS16 is very good at playing. He rarely loses a game, @CAPS1 needs to win at least once to end the game. So while everyone gathered at our house, I persuaded @CAPS5 @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON1 to come and play @CAPS12-@CAPS13 @CAPS3 me. We entered the spare room at @CAPS1 and started dealing cards. About half an hour later, and we're still playing, @CAPS1 unsurprisingly, @CAPS5 won. Just before the food was ready @CAPS1 we were halfway through when my cousin @PERSON1 or @CAPS5 said to me some of the funniest things I think my little @NUM1 year old ears have ever heard, @ CAPS1 I started laughing. My family is so thoroughly entertained by @CAPS3 my laughter that they can't keep smiling @CAPS1's laughter is hidden and not smirking like me. Seems like my pointless laughter brings instant joy to my family, including my @CAPS16. @CAPS5's smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up to in my childhood. It's such an imaginative and colorful @CAPS1 coming to life in front of me, I'll adore his smile like I saw my first solar eclipse. At such a young age, I never quite understood what was so charming about his smile, but now I do. @CAPS5's smile shows true, healthy, unbreakable joy. His smile doesn't come around very often, so when it does, you know something good is happening. No one knew that was our @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. I certainly can't imagine it's @DATE1, I'd use @CAPS3 my @CAPS16. Everything is so perfect @CAPS1 is getting happier and it seems like a crime to end my life while so happy. Although if I were him, @CAPS1 @DATE1 would be perfect if I had to choose my @DATE1 @CAPS8. My only memory of @DATE1 is laughing, @CAPS1 was having fun. I can't think of a better way to spend my @DATE1 a little time @CAPS3 @CAPS5 then @DATE1, we're all totally happy with our card game, laughing, @CAPS1 smiling. Laughing is a funny thing. Everyone is unique and @CAPS1 can go from any kind of humor to pure joy. In times of doubt, laughter brings hope @CAPS1 always makes people smile. Someone, somewhere started quoting, "@CAPS25. Laugh. Love." I believe these three words can be combined, and @CAPS1 acting alone, sums up the real, meaningful meaning of each word for anyone willing to @CAPS25 The perfect life defined. Laughter brings a happy, humorous, @CAPS1 loving smile. Love brings us together, @CAPS1 When we strive to be happy @CAPS1 to love, that's when we can really @CAPS25. My grandfather loves every @CAPS1 and every one of his family @CAPS1 friends @CAPS1 prioritizes making them happy. He lives his life in the best way I believe anyone can @CAPS25. He passed away after a life full of love, happiness, @CAPS1, and most importantly, a special gift of laughter.
It may be true that some people say that laughter is good for the soul, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughter is also good for your mind. It can improve relationships, make friendships stronger, and even start @CAPS5 to make two people who know nothing about each other extremely close. You can meet new people or hang out with people you barely know and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want @CAPS5 to let @CAPS5 know them better. I like that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh at any age or gender. @CAPS5 not @NUM1 and women, you can be with a little boy, an old woman or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last time @DATE1 I never @CAPS5 did anything, so I decided I should start volunteering. Two places I can volunteer are: @CAPS5 the day care center next to my house, or the elderly home about @NUM2 miles away. I thought about it for a long time and trying @CAPS5 made the best decision for me. I can't make up my mind, and even if I don't admit it, I think they'll be as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided that I should do both so I could meet some new people and have new experiences. I started in daycare. I woke up at @NUM3 am and walked to @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm not at all sure what's going to happen with @CAPS5. I don't even know if I'm good with kids. I walked in and stood awkwardly at @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 manager came to @CAPS5 I asked if I could help @NUM4 year old coloring room. I nodded nervously. Should I give them @CAPS5 colors? @CAPS3 They can't color pictures themselves. There are only three of them! I think. Oh well, if I followed the directions, the day would be faster @CAPS2. When I entered @CAPS3, all the kids ran to @CAPS5 me with smiles on their faces. "@CAPS1 up to me!" said one. "@CAPS2 is here!" said another. "@CAPS3 right here!" "@CAPS4 on my photo!" "I drew a rainbow!" "I drew a car!" "I drew you!" @CAPS5 Well, I look down . @CAPS3 I'm on paper. A bunch of blue and green doodles. Had a great time that day. I laughed and had a great time with the kids. I learned that I love children very much, and I actually get along very well with them. The following week, I went to the @CAPS5 nursing home. I'm more nervous @CAPS3. I feel out of place. I haven't found out what @CAPS5 is helping me with, so I'm sitting in a chair in the hall. When the receptionist asked me who @CAPS5 saw, I said no one. Then she asked me why I was here and I replied, oh, I'm going to volunteer @CAPS5. She walked me down the hall and told me it was almost time for lunch, so I needed @CAPS5 to be ready for @CAPS5 to serve lunch. I did it and then I heard, I thought it was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone lunch with a big smile and it was really good. If one of them seemed a little down, or upset, I could smile at them and they would smile back, obviously in better spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most @CAPS3 people take a nap after lunch, so @CAPS3 only has three people outside of @CAPS3. I first played with a lady who uses @CAPS5 as a nurse. I let @CAPS5 get to know her very well within half an hour of our game; I won. Next up is a veteran. He participated in the @LOCATION1 war. He looks really good, but serious. I also won that game. The last person to use @CAPS5 is a comedian. He is so funny. He was telling jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few @CAPS5 a lot because he beat me at chess. That's my excuse. When I'm done, I'm in awesome mode and I can't wait for @CAPS5 to be back again. I learned a lot @DATE1. I find that everyone is similar in some ways, although everyone is unique. I realize you don't have @CAPS5 like the people you are with, @CAPS5 laughing and having fun. Age, race, gender, body type, mindset, maturity, etc. don't matter. The only thing that matters is that you're in the same place at the same time, try @CAPS5 to make your day the best it can be. I'm so glad I decided to volunteer @CAPS5 otherwise I would never have learned so much about people, love, life and laughter.
Looking back on my childhood, one of the things that shines brightest in my memory is laughter. From birth, I have always loved smiling and laughing. Just by laughing I found a sense of comfort, peace and confidence that I doubted I could find anywhere else naturally. This is probably partly because of my @CAPS1. We rarely see each other because he lives in @LOCATION2 and I live in @LOCATION3, but when we're lucky enough to spend time together, it's always full of laughter and joy. I believe he gave me my love for laughter. My parents told me that as a baby all my @CAPS1 had to do was laugh, my eyes brightened and my smile became as wide as the @LOCATION1 on my face. It's been that way ever since. One of my earliest memories is lying in my parents' bed listening to my @CAPS1 tell me jokes. I burst out laughing every time he finished talking, and he burst out when he saw me laughing. Important detail to note is that when my @CAPS1 laughs, his stomach is shaking violently like @ORGANIZATION1. I found this to be the biggest part of the joke. Once his stomach started to jump up and down, my laughter became uncontrollable. Our laughter escalated until tears rolled down our faces. Aside from bouncing his stomach when he laughs, my @CAPS1 has one of the most unique and infectious laughter that anyone has had the pleasure of hearing. It's a wonderful, rich laughter, words don't do justice, but once you hear it, you'll never forget it. His laughter can light up the darkest room in the house. To me, his laughter was almost medicinal. Whenever I hear @CAPS1 laughter, for a moment, the world stops and everything is fine in it. I'm not the only one who greatly appreciates my @CAPS1 laugh. My dad and he both love to tell jokes, which I've observed over the years, and it's one of the few items they've agreed on. From politics to religion to who should pay for dinner, it usually ends up in an argument between them. Because of this, they tend to avoid these topics for fear of confrontation. They never mention it, but from what I've observed over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the laughter they often share is the glue that keeps their relationship strong. If it weren't for the laughter, I sometimes wonder if they would still have a working, loving relationship. I will forever be grateful to my @CAPS1 for giving me a great gift without knowing it at such a young age. He created a deep and passionate love of laughter within me that got me through the toughest times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul, and when two people share laughter, they bond together in a precious, vulnerable and divine way. My day can be bad, when a joke is broken and laughter floods my body, everything brightens up, and my day's worries and stress seem so insignificant. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson my @CAPS1 taught me. If you can find humor, you can find peace in the most disastrous times. To me, laughter is a bit like a drug. It's a harmless, nutritious and life-saving drug that I'm proud to say I'd like to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @CAPS1.
Laughter is a wonderful element in any relationship. For example, if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship, then I'm pretty sure there isn't a strong bond between the two of you. For example, I once had a relationship that didn't have that humorous element, and I really didn't like the kind of relationship she had with me. Laughter is needed in any type of relationship, not friendship, boyfriend or girlfriend, or even family. All different types of relationships require some form of humor to survive. Sometimes family members don't have that sense of humor, but they still have that special friendship, and I'm sure it's because your family will always be there for you, unlike most friends. One way I know this is because a friend of mine really likes a guy and I can swear she @MONTH1 even loved him and she cried several times when he told her he started dating a certain girl Weeks, not when she was at her mother's house, a brother she thought hated her said he wanted to hurt the man who made his sister cry. They @MONTH1 have no humorous friendships, or even friendships at all, but I believe laughter isn't always needed, especially in families. All types of relationships are like plants, flowers are relationships, and laughter is water that can help relationships grow and thrive. But without water, plants cannot grow, like laughter in love. I know if I know someone I don't find humorous, I know our friendship won't be strong, unlike someone I find funny. Laughter has always been an important element in everyday life. For example, if you're going for an interview, you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression on yourself. One way is through laughter, I've heard a lot of stories about job interviews, one example is my mom interviewed for a @CAPS1 job a while ago and she told me about her interview and she said they had a real connection. They also had some seriousness and some laughs in that interview, and they emailed her three days later to tell her she got the job and they would be happy to hire her. I've heard they didn't get interviews for the job. My sister once interviewed a pet kennel type place where they kept their pets on vacation and she said she had no connection with the people who interviewed her, which resulted in no humor or laughter. So I believe humor is such a wonderful element in a relationship because laughter brings greatness and happiness.
Laughter is the key. You never really think about the importance of laughter, but the truth is that laughter brings together the most opposing people. Last year, I met a brother friend of mine at school. We never really talked, but she seemed fine. We had a class together and we started talking more and more every day, she and my best friend are best friends. @PERSON1 is her name and she drives a bright orange @ORGANIZATION1. We were out playing after school one day, and I slid the passenger seat back and sat on it like a dog, she slammed on the brakes, and I flew to the front of the car, unable to stop laughing. At that moment, I knew we would be friends. I'm a freshman so I didn't really know anyone and she was nice to everyone so we started hanging out more. I live about @NUM1 miles out of town and her brothers go to school about @NUM2 miles from my house so we had to pick them up. We bought a game called "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" which had a lot of little peas that tasted like vomit, centipedes, dirt, rotten eggs, etc. So we played while driving and @CAPS3 had to stop this car almost @NUM3 times during our @NUM4 mile drive! Those are the most hated beans ever! Then, we would drive to my house and listen to our favorite country songs and play them in her car. She is my best friend and no one can replace her. Whenever we fight, we don't start a farce, we always fight because when one of us is pinned down, the other is already laughing too hard to do anything about it. Her dad and my dad later became friends too, and we always had BBQs and family gatherings. We also keep talking in @CAPS4 accents because one of our friends is from @LOCATION1. Whenever we go shopping @CAPS5 we use our accent and wherever we go people ask where we are from. Before we knew it, our dad started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang terms and then the whole school started using them. She is a good friend and she makes me laugh every day. Whenever @PERSON1 has a problem with her family, she knows she can always talk to me and I will always be there for her. She always calls me sister instead of @CAPS6 because we are close. She used to take @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 classes at my old high school and when she got the dummy it would keep us up until @TIME1 and that kid went crazy. @PERSON1 would drive, the baby would start screaming in the car seat and we had to stop and figure out what was wrong. She will be a good mother. She always cared about things, even the smallest things she would cherish. Once we painted her brother's room out of boredom, @PERSON1 was using her brush to paint and text and she took her eyes off her phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it in @NUM5 minutes, and when she did, it was completely covered in green paint! I smiled at her for so long and these are the moments I wish I could bring back. I laugh every time we hang out and now I realize how important laughter is to me. I moved to a completely different state about six months ago and I don't see her very often. There is no one like @PERSON1. She makes me laugh and when I need something she is always @NUM5 minutes away and now I have to drive about @NUM2 hours to see her. I haven't laughed as much as she has made me since I went back to visit. Laughing is the key, as I said before, if you frown you never know who is in love with your smile.
A few years ago, when I was @NUM1, I decided to do an experiment about laughter and the colors people wear. I realize I laugh a lot because @CAPS11, I'm almost always happy, I did @CAPS1 in school, and my attitude is very "up". @CAPS6's clothes are all very bright and "happy" colors. I have a theory that the less a person laughs and the darker the clothes they wear, the lower their mood and attitude. The experiment will go on for a week, during that time I'll try @CAPS7 lol, then gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I get dark and see how I'm affected, if at all. Before I start, I have to tell everyone what I'm doing and let them try @CAPS7 to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store to buy new clothes without the bright colors. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were so bright. After that I just have to wait for @DATE2 to end and @DATE3 to start. @DATE3 @TIME1 I get up to do @CAPS6's day job and try on @CAPS6's new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised expressions of @CAPS6 classmates @CAPS2 in their @CAPS6 outfits. @CAPS11 It's hard for @CAPS7 to laugh at some of their expressions, but I can't because that would ruin what I'm trying to accomplish. All day, I got comments about @CAPS6 outfits and some @CAPS6 teachers were worried because I didn't laugh @CAPS2 like I usually do, but when I told them about the @CAPS6 experiment, they understood and said, "@CAPS1 Luck ." @CAPS2 the day is over, I'm so happy with the success of @CAPS6 that I quickly fell asleep. The next two days are pretty much the same, and I wonder if the @CAPS6 theory will be proven wrong. But on @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS6 mom pointed out I look different. "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 okay?" she asked. "@CAPS4 doesn't seem as energetic as @CAPS2 @TIME1, your @CAPS7 doesn't smile at all. Is your @CAPS7 sick @CAPS3 @CAPS4?" I told her I was fine. At school I was asked the same thing and after a while @CAPS11 was really annoying. I was pissed and yelled at them, I never did, and they apologized. But I feel bad, tell them I'm sorry, they forgive me, and tell me @CAPS11 might just be an experiment. I'm kind of happy to think that the @CAPS6 theory might be correct. The day passed slowly and I'm happy when @CAPS11 is over. @DATE4 is the last day of the @CAPS6 experiment and I'm happy for that. I don't mind dark clothes, I love the way they look at me, but @CAPS11 hard @CAPS7 laughing, @CAPS11 is starting to frustrate me. I decided to wear some @CAPS6 bright colors that day to see if @CAPS11 would make a difference, and when I got to school some of my @CAPS6 friends didn't recognize me as they were used to seeing me in @ Other clothes from CAPS6. It feels no different than when I wear @CAPS6 dark clothes. In @CAPS5, I had to stand in front of the class and give @CAPS6 a conclusion. "The @CAPS6 theory has been shown to be semi-correct," I said. "@CAPS7's laughter really had an impact on the mood and attitude of @CAPS6. I yelled at my friends at @CAPS6 for being sad when I shouldn't. But I found that wearing dark clothes didn't change anything. " Then @CAPS6 teacher said something funny that made me laugh and everyone applauded: "@CAPS9 is back @CAPS10!" @CAPS11 really feels like @CAPS1 is laughing again.
Laugh, laugh, everywhere. Many people are laughing now. Why not laugh? Is this good for you? It feels good to laugh with them here. Well, laughter can brighten your day. It can help you get through tough times. It can help you make your best friend happy. Well, whatever the reason, it's good to laugh. Laughter is good for you, it brings fun, joy and helps you have more fun. I have a good relationship with my mother. Every time we were together, or when we started talking, we laughed at each other. Laughing helps us build good relationships because we can tell each other anything. I can always go to her for help. I can talk to her anytime I need to now. Because we had a good relationship, she didn't do good things, she got involved in bad things. She is also very depressed. I will tell you a little. My day starts with a normal school day, I get up and get ready, go to school like that, and then because I'm new, I'm on the bus home. I got off the car a block or two from home and walked home. I walked and walked, and after about ten minutes, I got up and went to my house. I went back to my room, put my bag on my bed, and went to say hi to my mom. I went into her room and she was sitting in a chair. I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk. Well, of course she said yes. She puts on her shoes, and so do I. We went down the driveway, where the walk started. After we reached the end of the driveway, we started walking down the road. We walked straight for about five minutes and then turned right. We walked that road for about ten minutes and turned left. They are a small shop on the coroner. We stopped them from buying some water and some snacks while walking. Once that was done, we started heading east on the road. When I look back at my mom, she looks like she's having a bad day. Like anyone, I asked her what was wrong. She talked to me about everything and she looked sad and depressed. From that I knew I needed to talk to her and make her laugh. We never had the best relationship because she was always hanging out with friends. I know that if I can make her laugh and help her get better, it will help us get along better and help each other in the long run. I love my mom and I hate seeing people disappointed. I though this is all in my head. Being around me makes everyone laugh. The walk is about three to four miles long. For the rest of the time, I kept her laughing all the way back. I know it makes her feel better. Later that day, she came to my room and we played some boring games and watched a movie or two. We really just spent the rest of the day chatting and hanging out. Over the next month or two we took a few more walks and we had a great mother-son relationship. We are all glad this happened. About two months after the first walk, she came up to me and hugged me and told me thank you for helping her figure out what she was doing. I think laughter is a big thing in life. For me, it has helped me a lot in life, it has helped me save my relationship with my mom. I like to laugh, and I like to make people laugh, and laughing is fun and fun. Laughter makes great friendships. It probably has a lot to do with your life. I hope this helps you laugh more and makes you try to be funny and make people laugh with you.
Laughter is just one of those things that doesn't go away easily. The simplest things can make you laugh or smile, the point is that happiness lasts for a while. My dad laughed, my mom laughed, I laughed, everyone laughed, and that's a good thing. If there is no such thing as being happy, people will be at war, and nations will be at war. Anger is not something a person wants to deal with all the time. You have to relax every now and then. My parents and I both know that happiness is what drives us to pursue good things. That's why we embrace it at home and we love acknowledging it to my younger siblings. My dad and I also have a great relationship, and my mom and I get along very well and laugh together. Me and my girlfriend @LOCATION1; we had a great relationship at first, but over time it started to fade. We don't communicate well and that's what keeps us apart. We fight all the time, and fights for no reason seem to be looking for us all the time. We talked, we hung out together, we started getting along better, laughing at our jokes or our constant teasing of each other. We had a great time and she said she liked us laughing and having fun. I told her that laughter and enjoyment are what brought us together. Laughter is the key to our happiness, it brings me closer to her, which is the main point of any relationship. If there is no joy there is no laughter, and if there is no laughter, how can you be happy. It's a good thing they work together, where would we be if we didn't have it. We all hold grudges, hold grudges for no reason, and live in black and white all the time.
A few years ago, my dad and I were sitting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 ran in and out of our apartment. I never close the sliding glass door every time I enter, finally my sister closed the door, but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he ran too fast and unknowingly fasted into the sliding glass door! My dad and I laughed so hard I almost pissed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to check on him, he looked very confused by what had just happened. We looked at the door and there was no doubt that there was a saliva mark on the door, as if his face had slid through it. Meanwhile, we're back watching @CAPS1 after more laughter and fun calm down. My dad fell asleep with his cat lying next to him and after a few minutes my dad woke up a bit and looked around and he started watching @CAPS1 again. The older brother walked into the room, saw the cat sleeping, and took the opportunity to pat the chair. It scared the cat, it jumped two feet up and we started laughing again, but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 Regarding @DATE1, my dad was in trouble, I was working in the garage and found an electric @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends, so I did. He flipped the switch, and the next thing I knew I was electrocuted. We started laughing again. Next was my bro but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself and when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tense and let him @CAPS4 - be able to shock from nine volts Freed from it. My dad and I were on our knees and almost in tears because it was so much fun. After a few rounds of self shock we came up with the idea of putting it on my tongue, I tried it first and my tongue started beating like a beating heart. My dad couldn't hold himself long enough to hold down the button. As a result, during all these fun moments, our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave away the cat, and @PERSON1 moved. In better words, fun times @MONTH1 are a thing of the past, but there will always be smiles in your memory.
@ORGANIZATION1 is a wonderful gift. It unites your mind and body with others. It is the source of happiness and brings sanity to those who have lost hope. Laughter and laughter will accompany you when you feel that there is no one by your side in this world. At one point in my life I felt confused and alone. I am empty. Loneliness is the only thing I can have and the only feeling I can record in my mind. Just when I thought I @MONTH1 was the only one in the world, something came to my rescue. I was six when they divorced. I can't stand hearing my parents fight. One day we are the perfect family. We would play board games together and go to the movies together. Things changed quickly. My @CAPS1 grabs his jacket, tells me he loves me, and he's gone. Will I ever see him again? Why doesn't @CAPS1 live with us? These are the questions I keep asking myself. I guess I'm too young to really know what's going on. The days are long and I find myself dull and sullen. About two weeks after my @CAPS1 left, some neighbors moved into the house next door to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I don't give much thought to the new people in town. I tell myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike thinking I should stop pedaling and hit my fence. I hit the metal fence and fell. I heard laughter and turned around. That's the new neighbor's kid. He rolled around on the ground, grabbing his side. He must have thought my crash was an entertainment. I picked up my bike, started moving, and crashed again. The boy let out another series of laughter. That was the first time I smiled in a long time. I'm getting more and more into any feeling or humor I give this new kid. I asked the boy his name, and he didn't answer; though he did start laughing again. He laughed at my voice. Everything I did made him hysterical. Later I found out that he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't say a word to @CAPS2. In about a month, I felt like the hole in my heart started to fill. My new partner and his laughter is the beginning of a new beginning for me. My mom and I ended up moving out of our house and losing touch with our neighbors. I always think of him when I hear laughter. Although he wasn't physically close to me, I was guided by his laughter every day.
Laughter is the best medicine Many people say that laughter is the best medicine. I am one, agree. The reason is that in many areas of @CAPS27's life, laughter helps me or others feel better. @CAPS27 Mom recently had shoulder surgery. @CAPS4 took meds @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 was when I was with her in her room three nights ago...searching for words. This is @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 stepfather's kid will come over for dinner. @CAPS27 Mom is not feeling well so @CAPS4 goes upstairs @CAPS2 and starts reading her big book. @CAPS27 Stepsister recently bought a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 Stepfather is outside watching it. I went out @CAPS19 for two minutes and came back. @CAPS27 stepbrother on @CAPS27 stepfather's iPad. He showed me the game at @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. Minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 stepfather said he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 stepsister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 stepbrother, decided to join them @CAPS46. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 if mom @CAPS4 needs anything. Then they left @CAPS2 and I went upstairs to see her. I saw @CAPS4 was searching for her word @CAPS2 and I started helping her. I don't recall we did a few word searches for the name of @CAPS34. Since @CAPS4 has started, I'm looking at the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I didn't look close enough because I swear I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said @CAPS2 @CAPS27 Mom said, "@CAPS1 me?" @CAPS2 and I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 and we were all laughing. After that, we finished the word search @CAPS2 and started a new one. This one is called "@CAPS3". @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked at the list @CAPS2 suddenly said "@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 went crazy. Which is @CAPS4. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 and I started laughing so hard @CAPS2 asked: "@CAPS8 of @CAPS7?" When @CAPS24 laughed so hard, I got it wrong @CAPS34, who wouldn't? "@CAPS7?" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed her. "@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13." @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 and we started laughing. "It sounds like something @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say." I laughed even harder when I commented that @CAPS2 @CAPS27 Mom sang this little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song. We barely finished the word search. @CAPS34 We did it. I think the next one to be called "@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21" @CAPS22 is a few things we don't know about @CAPS22. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4 or something like, "I don't know." @CAPS2 Then I asked her another. "@CAPS24 is asking me all the things I don't know," @CAPS4 said. This word search is kind of funny @CAPS34, just because we say the rest of the letters after the actual word, which makes them interesting. I accidentally circled the word "ear" because I thought it was on the list. no. @CAPS34 "Earrings" yes. We ended up finding the "hair" at the end of the "ear" I circled. "@CAPS26 thanks for that photo." @CAPS27 mom said. "@CAPS7? Ear hair?" I asked @CAPS2 and we laughed again. Once that's done, we go to "@CAPS29". That's a fun word search. We usually read through the word list before looking up the word. One of the words was "@CAPS30" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said "@CAPS26 Yeah, I can see someone wearing @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, great @CAPS30.'" I said strangely in my voice . "'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'" I think I'm doing well because @CAPS27 mom really had a big laugh. "Won't @CAPS34 be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I think the tail always slaps @CAPS20 on the back of the head." I laughed again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked into the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 what the hell? @CAPS2 I showed her word search. "@CAPS26, this is not a cowboy hat. This is a complete cowboy." @CAPS4 also laughed. @CAPS27 Mom shakes her head, trying to say something. "@CAPS39, @CAPS39, this is the hat thing." @CAPS4 managed to leave @CAPS2 I was looking at her. "Is the hat @CAPS30 wears @CAPS7?" I asked with a smile. @CAPS4 shakes his head. "I don't know." @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 is giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 Then say goodbye to @CAPS2 and leave. "@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills." I snorted @CAPS7 @CAPS4. "@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills." @CAPS4 looked at me like @CAPS4 would hit me. @CAPS4 Might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. "@CAPS46 far." @CAPS4 laughs. "@CAPS48." I said before turning @CAPS2 back to the @CAPS27 room. I've encountered several such things. They are all very interesting. They're humor that @CAPS24 has to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still say laughter is the best medicine. Mom said it was @CAPS49.
The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3! This @CAPS2 started out like any other @CAPS2. I woke up thinking what should I do. So, I walked out of my room and asked my mom if we had any plans. 'We don't have any plans,' she said. So after that I talk to her more. I went back to my room where I saw that I had probably gotten a text message from my @CAPS1 friend @Person3. He asked me if I wanted to hang out with him. I decided, of course I will, because I have no family plans. "I love hanging out with you @Person3 maybe". @Person3 may meet me at the @NUM1 bus stop to The Royals and join us at @ORGANIZATION2. Now understand the reason why we went to @ORGANIZATION2 because before @CAPS2 I already got a gift card from my grandmother and fifty bucks from @CAPS4 (@CAPS4 is my biological father). When we finally arrived @ORGANIZATION2 asked me what were we going to get here. I say what I want. He started to spoil the laugh. I bot a fool's shirt and some groceries. From @ORGANIZATION2 we go to @CAPS6 @CAPS7 to get some good food. When we walked into the restaurant, the aroma from the place made us salivate a little bit. @Person3 probably has a big bowl, stuffed @CAPS15 with everything he can. We ate so much. I like to link ten pounds. We talk about life and how awesome food is. When our next meeting is still undecided. We finally finished our food. I prayed for a bowl of food and we went to our bus stop, heading downtown @PERSON1. While we were on the bus @Person3 probably decided we should go to @ORGANIZATION1. So we got out of the car, you know what my friends @CAPS8 boys, @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @PERSON2 do, @PERSON4 is the downtown connection chill like a villain. @Person3 probably went and smoked a cigarette. When I went to check out the bus stop sign for the @ORGANIZATION4 bus. He and I had to wait @NUM2 minutes. So we Gust hang out with our friends. @CAPS9 is the funniest guy @CAPS3. I laughed until I started to cry. I almost pissed myself off. We left to get into the car and laughed a little more. When we got to @ORGANIZATION4 we had to know why we even went there. So, we just walked around. @Person3 probably decided we should get into photo booths to make this @CAPS2 legal. I had a lot of fun making our shots. The next place we go is the @CAPS11 topic. I love that store. We are there @CAPS3. Pass in about two hours. There is a park like this in @ORGANIZATION4, you can go but you have to cross the bridge to get to @CAPS15. @Person3 Probably, I got bored and went on an epic adventure to this park. Yes, we took a few paths. I stumbled on a branch. @Person3 probably mocked me. We found this piece of concrete. @Person3 maybe put some music and dance with me @CAPS12 @CAPS13. I love the really fun dancing of @CAPS14 music. I have orange soda that @Person3 might drink. I took a lot of pictures of him drinking soda. We pretend the grass is lava and the concrete is where the cave people break dance. I put @Person3 possible video dancing and laughing to the song @CAPS15s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 by Sponge Bob. He also ate all my chips, my bot at @ORGANIZATION2. After this, we go back to the path and skip through the tree. I was eating and drinking with the old people at Trobird. Also tell them to taste the rainbow. We finally realized we needed to get back home, so he and I started walking back to the bus stop. Those who missed the first train caught the next one. Hanging out of town for an hour. Chill out with my friends at @NUM3 park. Received @ORGANIZATION3 Donuts. That place is epicly bad ass! Got some interest from this cool shop at the station. As @CAPS2 ends @Person3 may go separate ways with me to go home. Both sides also said this @CAPS2, "that @CAPS2 is epic".
One day after school my friends @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 went to the house and said put on my clothes that I would get dirty, I said no, but then I said ok and then @CAPS1 said put on the dinghies and we all started walking to Park, we got on the rails, and when you got off the rails, we got down this real step hill, I slipped on me, but they were all laughing at me at the top, and then they came, but they didn't fall down. So we kept going and we went over a log to the other side and we kept going and then they took me to a mud pit and they told me it was deep so I went in and I got stuck in the mud because it passed took my boat and I tried to get out but I leaned far forward and fell into the mud, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 thought it was too funny, they laughed at me, the boat was still stuck in the mud, I was a On a log so I asked @CAPS2 to get my boots so she tried and she fell so I was still stuck and couldn't get out but @CAPS1 came and helped me get a boot out and then Another one, and then @CAPS1 got stuck and me and @CAPS2 ran back and we all started beating each other up and everyone was falling and laughing at each other but Magen was in the tree watching she didn't want to get dirty, so After that we got all the jactkats and we started walking home and then we got to the step hill and I fell so I ran up the hill and didn't slide back and then @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 they were trying to go It was so much fun to walk back and watch them go up the hill so we were all after a while and we walked home along the tracks and everyone was looking at us because we were all muddy except @CAPS3 so We kept going and then we got to Austin's house and we got his hose out and he didn't let him get himself dirty when he did, me and @CAPS2 left him and then she told me in her face Put a handprint on so I did and she told me now she can do it and I said hahaha you're funny and then I ran off from her but she got me and then we all got rinsed dropped and went to my house
Humans...unusual...well, we're weird. There are so many people in the world, including ourselves, that the only way we like ourselves is to make others like us; and if that's not weird enough, no matter who likes us, we still don't like ourselves. What are we thinking? We always use relationships to help us understand who we are; even having those relationships is a gamble. Faced with the fact that we take so much risk to depend on others; we empower them to build us up...or break our abilities. As young people, our main goal is to find people who like us. I think it might even span to the later stages of life! From my experience, I know that knowing a person can build us with two key points: trust and kindness. Finding builders with these characteristics is as easy as finding out if they bring you joy. One person can give you happiness just by being nice to you...but if you want a big group of friends then that's not the best way. Not that being kind is a bad way to make friends...just that it's not the fastest way. If the builder is nice, of course you'll be their friend...just in time; to meet a friend right away when you see one, they'll make you laugh. Laughter allows us to enjoy time with friends, it's the golden rule in @CAPS1's book, if ever there was one. It's through laughter that my experience in the @CAPS2 class got better. @CAPS2 class is stressful for me. Every day we either have oral assignments or paperwork; and classes are really slow. Why is it so slow? It was slow because we could barely complete a set of instructions without some group speaking or finding other ways to interrupt the class. A good example is this type of project we have to do. Instructions are slow, as usual. I'm at a boiling point. But today seems to be different, despite the usual annoyance, none of the students asked to repeat the instructions, in fact, they all seemed to get it and got to work right away. I also follow this move. The task was that each group of about three to four people had to create a script using vocabulary learned from the booklet provided; it took an entire class, and then everyone went home to do other work. It was definitely a fun day for us back at @CAPS2 the next day. The teacher prepared all kinds of strange props for us. Obviously we want the audience to act out our script, our job is to read it aloud. My group was the first to entertain and we ended up choosing our volunteers and cast. Tiffany, @PERSON1 and I are sitting in the back of the classroom getting ready to read the script, not knowing what the actors will offer. Our play... Succeeded? ! By the end of the first sentence, everyone was giggling. The laughter grew louder as we moved on to the next game. The students had a great time, and more and more volunteered for the show, until the cast was hard to choose. Even the snob in my classroom enjoyed it. The dramas are fun and casual, some of which will make everyone hysterical. I can easily remember one of the sets that made me laugh so hard that my sides were in pain, tears ran down my eyelids, and I could barely breathe. This program is definitely the best I have ever participated in. In moments like these, we build strong unity in the classroom, we enjoy everyone around us, and we enjoy ourselves. I was so used to being angry with my classmates that I was taken aback that day. Love their dramas so much, I see them now as a fun bunch of students instead of the troublesome ones I used to see. These people are no longer strangers in the hallway, they are now family. It's amazing how something as simple as laughter can change a person's perception of others and themselves.
@CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 Will we be without laughter? Will we still have relationships/friendships like @CAPS5? Laughter brings @CAPS1 closer to someone's feeling, sense of humor, friendship and positive environment. Personally, I feel that the world would be a miserable place without laughter. I can guarantee @CAPS17 life is different than @CAPS5. The @CAPS17 @DATE1 holiday wouldn't be what it is without the laughter. @CAPS17 friends and I are on a mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5) on @DATE1 vacation. However, it's not as easy as @MONTH1 sounds like, because nothing can bring her down. We tried our best to embarrass her, but nothing worked. We tried tossing her into the pool while she was obsessed, pouring our drinks on her, like a bunch of cute boys walking by, calling her names that only grandma would call a child. @CAPS14 named it and we did. @CAPS12 is like a marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @PERSON2, a close friend of @CAPS17, came up with the idea to grab a pair of shorts, remove the butt look, and glue it together in the hope that it will rip when @PERSON5 bends over. “@CAPS3 @PERSON5, ” I began, “@PERSON2 and I found these shorts at @TIME1 and thought @CAPS14 might like them. They’re super cute and match your new yellow tank top. ” @CAPS4! Thank you everyone, they fit well!" @PERSON5 screamed, @CAPS12 full of excitement. "@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!" @CAPS6 walked around the mall for about an hour or so and I dropped the @CAPS17 phone like I didn't notice. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 as it slid off the pavement. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over to grab my sweetheart, @PERSON4 walked up to her. Next thing @CAPS14 knows, her shorts are split down the middle and her cheeks are flushed. @PERSON2 I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7's face is priceless. I wish I had the @CAPS17 camera. We've never seen @PERSON5 so crazy. @CAPS12 is very pissed but @PERSON2 and I are still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 in front of a huge crowd at the mall @CAPS10 someone's pants are ripped? "@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11," @CAPS12 screamed. "@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13 and @CAPS14 is @CAPS9? He'll never talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!" "@CAPS14 don't hate us. That's hysterical, @CAPS14 knows it A little," echoed @PERSON2. "@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14, eh?" "@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock," @PERSON2 I giggled and I gave each other a high five. Minutes later, @PERSON5 started bashing @CAPS9 and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 because they realized it was all funny. Little did we know that @CAPS12 was planning to bring us back. At the end of the @DATE1 break, we had almost all the parties, but @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 still had one. We all have a gut feeling @CAPS1 that this will be the best so far. Everyone had a great time @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1 party. The strobe lights are on, there is crazy, loud music, the hot tub is the perfect temperature for @CAPS10, and there is a crowd in the pool. Who can complain? Just when the party was about to stop, @PERSON5 decided to pull the @CAPS17 bikini top and pull down the @CAPS19 bikini bottom! Shame, we both ran into @LOCATION2's room and locked the door. How did @CAPS12 get this far? Did our prank embarrass her? Tired of all the nagging from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about our escape, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Assuming we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we won't do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her like we did on a mall trip. Honestly, I feel like this whole experience has brought us closer together. If that doesn't destroy our friendship, nothing will. So @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 understand why I think laughter is an important part of friendships and/or relationships. It makes the world go round. @CAPS14 Has any experience @CAPS2's laughter brought @CAPS14 closer to friends, significant other or family?
During the @CAPS1 break, my family went to @LOCATION4 except my brother. We go to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. It was a long journey there, but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents' house, it was already snowing! I am very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before going out to enjoy the snow. Later, when I was outside, my old friend visited me. I haven't seen them since @DATE1. We chat and hang out. They told me I was lucky enough to leave school early when @CAPS1 was on break. They still have to go to school. I told them that if they were lucky, they only needed the first half a week. They are indeed lucky. @DATE3 They go to school and they get off the rest of the week because the road is icy. I'm glad they took the rest of the week off and now we can actually hang out during the break. That night, my grandma made us some roast chicken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. really good. I love cooking for my grandmother, she was the head chef at the school where she worked. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 is a very cold day. My friend invited me to shoot airsoft guns. This will be my first time. It was fun to be with my friends again. My friend @PERSON6 told me I made a typo when I tried to shoot with an airsoft gun. "@CAPS3 did I shoot it wrong?" I asked him (past tense. He told me he really didn't know and that I was a bad shot. I reminded him it was my first time. Then he put his arms around him Me, trying to help me aim better. It's embarrassing, but I'm kind of frustrated. Sometimes I hate people trying to help me when I don't want to. That's one of them. But he's one of my best friends, so Not bad. When done, @PERSON6 asked me to hold his air gun while he was holding something. He also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was turning the gun with one finger and somehow Yes, I shot him in the back. He was startled and asked why I shot him. "I didn't mean it either. I turned the gun in my finger and somehow shot you! And you Say the safety gear is on!" @PERSON6 forgives me and tells me it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 and my cousin @PERSON4 were all there LOL. @CAPS4 admitted he was the one who shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decided he was going to fight back @CAPS4. Then somehow it became an all out shooting between us all. I played that day So happy. It was one of my favorite memories when I was there. My @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked me if I could babysit for her when I was still @LOCATION4. So after lunch the next day, I Let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after dinner. My cousin @PERSON5 is taking a nap, so I told @PERSON2 we can't make any noise. I decided to go outside with him to play in the snow. When done, we decided Back in the house. We were locked. Then I remembered @TIME1 and @PERSON2 was messing with the lock while my @CAPS5 was still at home. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was also Locked. @PERSON2 told me the garage door can be opened but he doesn't know the code. I feel really stupid. After a few more minutes we went to one of their neighbors' houses so I could call my @ CAPS5 because I don't have her mobile number. But the neighbors only have their house numbers. Then I called my dad so I could get her number. I told him what happened and he started laughing. @ PERSON5 is still taking a nap so everything is ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me it was ok, it happened to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes while out of the house Before, she would carry a key with her to make sure the door was unlocked. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that, @PERSON2 and I had a great time outside. I had a great time at @LOCATION4 . Just being in @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to go. Especially when I am with my friends and family.
"laugh" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 really think that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from great things in life and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, joy and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feelings we can have, although it can hurt if too much. It can teach others ways to express themselves and forget about the bad things in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a hole. But you always have to push the laughter, because even laughter has a limit. There are different ways to bring laughter in someone's life, and there are different ways to be funny. There is a good way to be funny and bad way of life. A bad way to be a class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can put you on the bad side of your teacher. A good way to do this is to tell a joke or maybe embarrass yourself at work sometimes. It seems the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, you don't have to look as bad as you think it is. I know I can be funny sometimes, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it's never been good at making someone laugh and embarrassing them. Making another feel bad can make you look good, and other people @MONTH1 don't think you're funny. You never want to put the other down, people have feelings, and hurting people just makes you look like the bad guy. @CAPS1 People think happiness is a fairy tale and also love, but when the happiness you really want isn't your friends' turn, make them laugh. It feels great to get another smile, and it builds confidence and character. Having confidence and character does help you in life, it brings more joy, love and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together, it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make people laugh, laughter sometimes just happens for no reason. Laughter can win again the way the heart is open. Being a hole can make you look like you're not a funny person or really that funny. When people fall in love, they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter can help your relationship and make it stronger. What we really need in life is happiness and success, and with joy and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you are making more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find a big part of your life. There are many adventures that life will take you through. I love to laugh, which makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good in and out of it. I also like to make people laugh. For example how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She is not happy, she thinks there is no plan in the world, I know she is not happy, I don't want her to feel that way. So as a friend, I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. We've been best friends since then and she's never felt like this again. Laughter is indeed a great thing that brings joy to all of us. And the person who makes others laugh makes you more interesting, is a funny person who makes life easier and less stressful. Sharing this wonderful feeling is great and can make your life more stressful about freedom. Stress can slow your disappointment, along with grief. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes, just the little things in life are the biggest things in life. In my opinion, I think laughter is the greatest feeling you can give a person. Looking for something is equally great, like finding meaning in life. No one really knows what life is about, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So, go out and tell a joke or two and just make people laugh and feel good.
Not long ago, I had a friend named @PERSON4. We are best friends; like two peas in a pod. We hang out every day, all day @DATE1. On a random day, we walked over to another friend @PERSON1's house to see if she could hang out. We all hang out all day when @PERSON1 comes up with an idea. She wants me and @PERSON2 to stay at @TIME1. We stayed outside after dark and just walked around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house so she could get her clothes and leave to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. On the way there, we stopped again at @LOCATION2's house and it got cold for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes just laughing at all the crazy things @CAPS9 happened on @DATE1! When we finally hugged to @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's brother, patted @PERSON1's ass and told her it was good. We made fun of her for the longest time ever! Not to mention @CAPS3 was talking about @CAPS9 until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2. As we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing for @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random guy stopped to ask for directions. Then I took him to where he was going and he said, "@CAPS6 you," and drove off. After he left, @PERSON4 looked at me and screamed, "That's the most handsome guy I've ever seen @CAPS7!" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 We saw that guy again as we were on our way to @CAPS10. @CAPS8 He wasn't as hot this time. He had a scruffy face, long brown hair, unkempt in a ponytail, dressed like a homeless man. To this day, I still give her crap @CAPS9. That's the biggest @TIME1 in @DATE1. We ended up going to @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to get some drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out about @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to go back to @LOCATION2's house hoping we could find it. Retracing our steps, we met this man who was trying to help us find it. By then it could be @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14' clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before we even stepped in her front door, her mom rushed out and started screaming at @LOCATION3. So when I knocked on the door, her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 because the door was locked and everyone was asleep so we had nowhere to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4, I'm homeless. We walked around @TIME1. I almost fell asleep at the laundromat when I remembered my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a white pickup truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. There was a bed in the back of the truck, no, I don't know why, and it sounded better than a hard floor in a laundry, so we climbed in. It's a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed to do it. Also, it exudes dirty socks and pee. Without a doubt the worst thing @CAPS7 has ever smelled. @CAPS8 is without a doubt the funniest @TIME1 I've had with that girl.
DUE Do you think it's part of the same fun? Well, the age of Sam is not very interesting. Because you are in adefokil stoeshl. In my opinion, trading rationally in Porto is for crossing other prsads. Because if it doesn't, it doesn't matter. Another pepolp @MONTH1 pallet kip then operates. Someone else or the same person you can trust. If you and other people say to you and other people, they will be taller. My point is that you can get all of them. If you are new here, you can get along with them. I have a good Flanders, trust me. Trust is a good idea if you don't notice your trust. Also good to be on board at the same time. You are happy, we are with you. you tell that person. Like me, I do not admit that we are brothers. Now I tell hem abrething. I was not real before. Because he said he was going to tall my mom and I'd be in trodol.now he's due to that. It's fun to hang out with me now. It's a good idea because he'll have fun. Because you can go to a party, you can go out when you are Franz. You can go to Mexico and vest. For me, I'll try to have fun. I'll take me to Patch to Marles. From there I would go to see my grandmother.
Everyone's laughing point is different, some people laugh to cry, some people do not laugh. But what they have in common is laughter. People use laughter to express their joy or well-being, or even if something is really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to make something feel happier, for example, maybe you had a bad day and a friend of yours came over and told you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, right? Having a good sense of humor can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, and even like I said, a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself, or even embarrassing things you may have done, is a good thing, and it helps you get over it without feeling embarrassed about it. I always feel better whenever I laugh, and laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of the good times I had with friends and family, it reminds me of all the inner jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years, and we can still laugh as much as ever. I believe laughter is a treat for everyone, it can make you feel better no matter what, and some people even say it makes you younger. When you laugh, it creates lasting memories that you will never forget, and when you talk about them again in the future, you will still think it's just as funny as before. Some of my best friends laugh at everything, they think every little joke is the funniest, their laughs are unforgettable, you can always hear them. This shows in another way how laughter can make anyone happy. If you don't think you're a funny person, just say a few words to one of them and I can guarantee they'll laugh, you'll be amused and probably start laughing too. I love spending quality time with some of my closest friends and probably the best time I ever had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 at the start of @DATE1 before entering high school. That was two days after we were promoted (graduated) from secondary school. We packed up the family car and headed to @ORGANIZATION1. Less than half an hour into the drive, we were already laughing at every little thing that happened. We always create great memories, and this is already one of the best. I'm sure my mom and aunt's car ride was just as fun, we sang and danced (in as many seats as possible) to as many songs as possible in those two hours. Of course during the drive we were stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the other cars looked at us and even the construction workers laughed at us, although it was funny. We make boring moments fun. Once we were finally there, we didn't hesitate to drop our bags, grab our bikes and set off to explore. The weather is so good, there is not a single cloud in the sky. During our Discovery Bike ride, we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to graduate from middle school and into high school. The next day we decided to go down the river on a raft and it sounded like fun. Well, if only we actually knew where to go. Throughout the river raft trip, we jumped back and forth between the two rafts, occasionally splashing each other with the paddles. Get to know us, we laugh all the way down the river. Whenever we passed people, I was sure they thought there was something wrong with us because we laughed so much and enjoyed each other's company. By the time we finished our rafting trip we were already hungry and thankfully my mom had some lunch for us and when we got home we could never keep our eyes on the table as we sat at the table. Even more funny, my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just watch each other laugh. You know you've made a great friendship and already know what your friends are thinking when you can look at All because of one little thing, called laughter.
Laughter can be used for many things. One of them can be an important part of the relationship. There are many key parts in a relationship. But the most important must be the part "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". @CAPS1 Laughter heals sad emotions. @CAPS1 It doesn't cure it. If laughter is the shortest distance between two people, then if a boy or girl meets someone they like. For example, I went to a girl before and didn't know what to do or say. So, I just tried my best to make her laugh. @MONTH1 spent days trying to do this. But, in the end, I'd much rather ask her out and feel more comfortable around her and her friends. @CAPS3 I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because seeing her in a bad mood is never a good thing. Now, in some cases, I make people laugh, but it doesn't make any sense. But, @CAPS3 I made my girls laugh and it was totally worth it. Because I can lift her up from any sadness or anger and make her happy and full of laughter. @CAPS1 also helps with depression. Her frustration was a bit like a train crashing the tracks. The results are never good. But @CAPS3 she is happy, she can be full of joy and giddy, @CAPS1 is spontaneous. I know it's good that @CAPS1 laughs alone. But @CAPS1 might be called a lunatic if you don't laugh at all. The best way to know someone might be feeling better is to laugh. If they laugh, then they are not angry, sad, or anything other than happy or sarcastic. But sarcasm can be blown away like it's nothing. If I try to make people laugh with sarcasm, I always offend them. So I'm always being myself around everyone around me. So if you've ever heard laughter is the shortest distance between two people. You should know this is true. Because you can not only get to more places and learn more about someone. However, you can also learn about the valuable things in life by being close to more people. @CAPS3 You hear this and ask yourself, "@CAPS2 Can I make people laugh? @CAPS2 Can I laugh out loud and actually get close to someone?" @CAPS3 You do this and you'll know to laugh Sound is indeed the shortest distance between two people.
Everyone lined up one by one to form a human train. The metallic red bell rang, and everyone pushed the door slightly open. Walking in, I was surrounded by the smell of @CAPS1 food and buzzing conversation in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. On the right is a wall covered with @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 symbols and meanings, while on the left there are hundreds of tables already filled. I didn't know where to look for my spot, I turned to my mom. I desperately want to plop and sit at an adult table, even if it means I have to sit there quietly. Moms know what's best and she pushed me to the back of the dining room to sit with my cousins. I did as she said, as usual, but expressed my reluctance. I walked to the table at a slug-like pace, dragging my feet on the floor and standing awkwardly at the round table. I pulled up a chair and turned to my mother, pleading with despair, because I knew she would never give in. Looking at these six relatives, I don't know what I think. You can sit here for the rest of the night. We all gathered at a @CAPS1 restaurant to celebrate my grandpa's @NUM1 birthday. Each of his kids flew from the mainland to @LOCATION1 to spend this special moment with him. I haven't seen these cousins in over @NUM2 years, maybe longer. I've visited with them since we were at @LOCATION1, but I haven't talked to them much, especially when we get together and are forced to socialize. I put the napkin on my lap and sat looking at my cousins and everyone stared at me like I was a zoo animal. After a minute or two, they seemed to forget I was there as they looked away and started talking to each other. The only person at the table that I don't feel like a complete stranger is my cousin @PERSON2. She has wavy brown hair with dazzling blonde highlights, sun-kissed on those bright tropical days, and that brown @CAPS6 skin that makes me jealous. We started talking and soon I found myself enjoying the moment. We didn't really start interacting as a group until the food came. As a teenager with a light taste, everyone stared at the first dish brought by the waiter. After asking the friendly waitress what we would like to eat, we learned from her broken @CAPS7 that they were buns with duck in them. In a frantic attempt to get all tables served at fairly constant intervals, she left our table, all of us staring blankly at our food. No one wants to take the first bite. One of my cousins @PERSON1 stepped up to play the male character of Brave Demon. We were all tentatively waiting for him to bite down on the soggy bread and swallow it. After chewing, he smiled, and the dish seemed to have his approval. Digging into my buns, I began to wonder if these people were easy to get along with, and I turned a small thing into a big thing. Since then, I've been myself, no longer worry about not seeing people for many years; all I need is to be myself. The way the course was set up gave them plenty of time to chat between each plate they brought. Since I no longer worry about what to say or how to say it, it's easy for me to get into the conversation and start to relax. Shortly after the duck tray was removed from the table, my cousin @PERSON1, from @LOCATION2, pronounced certain words with accents. Soon everyone started comparing the way we pronounce to the way he pronounces it. We chuckle after we spot every difference. For the rest of @TIME1, things went on like this, everyone was laughing at things that were only moderately funny, but we thought it was hilarious. As I realized @TIME1, even if you @MONTH1 are uncomfortable with a group of people you don't know very well, finding a common ground can help ease that discomfort. It's hard to find things you all love to talk about @MONTH1, but it's much easier to find things that make you laugh. Laughter is something everyone loves, even if they're not involved in the conversation. By feeling as if you are part of what is going on, you will feel accepted, which is what anyone wants.
People say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A @ORGANIZATION1 I saw @CAPS6 was real when I met a girl named @PERSON1. Three years ago I was on a swing in a city @CAPS10 wondering if it would hurt if I jumped off. I took @CAPS15's chance, let go of the swing chain, and flew through the air, noticing the imbalance of @CAPS15's chest fall, everything slowed down, the temptation to see what happens when I hit the ground is huge . Holding on to the landing was a failure, and getting up from the landing wasn't very successful until I felt hands on @CAPS15's shoulders and arms. I looked up at the @CAPS15 helper and saw a girl. @CAPS5 Not a girl, but a pretty girl. A girl with green dazzling eyes that can stop an angry rhino from rushing towards her, hair fluttering in the wind, soft, tender skin that will make you feel how soft @CAPS11 is going to hurt. "@CAPS1." I can only squeeze. "@CAPS1, how are you?" @CAPS3 asked in a very concerned tone. "@CAPS4 I'm fine, @CAPS5 forgot to stick to the landing. Thanks for helping me, what's your name?" I'm back with @NUM1, welcome. What's your name? "@CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 giggled before @CAPS3 said her name. "@CAPS7, do you want to walk with me?" "I try to be vocal." @CAPS8, but I have to be @CAPS9 @CAPS10 because @CAPS15 Mom will be here soon. ” said @PERSON1. While walking around @CAPS10, we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random questions that each other had to answer. I found out that @CAPS3 @NUM2 is her favorite color is light blue, @ CAPS3 has always wanted to be a doctor. We walked some more @CAPS5 on the playground talking about past memories or things that happened to each other in the past. I asked her if @CAPS3 has siblings. She responded that @CAPS3 does have one Brother and two sisters. I noticed @CAPS3 lost in thought while listening to her and asked what @CAPS3 was thinking, @CAPS3 replied quickly. "@CAPS11, @CAPS5 wondering why I'm so happy with you. "That's probably what I'm doing . You feel good when you smile." Or it could be the charm of @CAPS15 that works for you. "I answered in an @CAPS12 accent." @CAPS13 @CAPS4 Definitely. "@CAPS3 barely uttered a laugh. Suddenly a car horn honked, we said goodbye and @CAPS3 left. I sat there watching the cars go down the road and hoped we @MONTH1 meet again, but at some point To some extent I know we won't because of @CAPS15 mom and I'm leaving the city for a small town half way across the country. Turning around and walking back to @CAPS15's house, last night in the city, all I can think of is her, and How a little laugh became a @CAPS16 friendship.
When a day is considered perfect, there are many things that can make it so. The best days of people's teenage years are @DATE3 outside of school pressure. My perfect day isn't on @DATE3, nor is it on @LOCATION2's crazy @DATE4 break. My perfect day is @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 on @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that I formed a friendship with @ORGANIZATION1. A friendship that is the best right now. A friendship based on happy hours, memories, storytelling and laughter. As of @DATE1, I've spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However, none was hotter than the weekend after @DATE4. We decided we needed to calm down and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. On the way, we went with two hillbilly boys and a dick in a truck bed. Arriving at @CAPS1 is weird because I'm so far from my comfort zone. It's also weird because I haven't met one of my souls that @ORGANIZATION1 is about to introduce. When I first saw @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2, I couldn't understand how @ORGANIZATION1 met them. She is athletic, driven, appropriate, and intelligent. The boys I shook hands with loved things like big trucks, fishing rods, and loud country bands. When I first met them, I didn't expect the opposite sex to be attracted to or like each other. Over time, I found my comfort zone again. As time went on, the jokes and laughter kept coming and I realized we were really alike. I don't think all the naive things we did @DATE2 in @MONTH1 will matter to me a few months from now, but they do. As we ran around the filthy creek with black lipstick as war paint and laughed until we cried, I realized how perfect the situation was. If that day didn't bring a smile to my lips and send my mind back to its comfort zone, it would be a day to be forgotten. If you look back on every happy memory you have, there is always one thing in common. A joke, or even a funny face, will make you laugh hard. Every time I drive past @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we were sitting around the fishing rod talking and laughing. I think of @ORGANIZATION1 laughing and running through the woods, tripping over my own feet. I think @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were smiling and pointing as we tried to go swimming. After all the crazy running and swimming, we were all so excited. @PERSON1, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 let us go for a walk; so we took it and then we got into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk took us to the top of a small pebble hill. I'm not sure what event caused @LOCATION1 to push @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I still remember @PERSON4 sliding down to join the fight. Watching three boys wrestle and play on Slippery Rock is like watching a movie about the fifties. No one is texting or messing with machines. There is laughter and silence all around us, dancing like the music around us. The day was stress-free and sunny. It's like something you can only dream of. Once you're in that moment, your own little world is pulling you in and you never want to leave it. When you laugh, you disconnect yourself, and in just a few seconds, your life is in its simplest form. You are you, there is no idea of running, no impatience. You are only one person. It never occurred to me that little things like laughing could make or improve a friendship. On that @DATE2, I realized that the laughter shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and me will be the first memory of what's to come. When I doubt the world, every event and every laugh we have that day becomes my thinking. This will always be a memory that makes me appreciate life. Someone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". @CAPS4 @DATE1 I wouldn't believe it, but laughing brings me closer to people I would have avoided. Laughter and smiles limit Minecraft to the world of @ORGANIZATION1 and a handful of @CAPS1 hillbillies. From @DATE1 @TIME1, everything changed.
Moving from one place to another is always difficult and I hate the idea of never seeing any friends or family. Never was the only word I could hold on to, hoping it was a futile feeling that was pointless. I know I'm going to miss @LOCATION1 terribly and @ORGANIZATION1 just sounds so far away; a twelve hour drive feels like the edge of the earth to me. I've been to @ORGANIZATION1 before and honestly it's boring and most of all looking for a new house is boring and all I can think of is @LOCATION1. Now I'm moving there! When I first heard about the move, I was pissed off and tried to argue against the bad decision, I'm sure my parents made a mistake. Although I fought hard, I couldn't win, my tears couldn't move my parents in the slightest, and even in my best efforts I was broken and confined to a moving van for twelve hours, but for me, It feels like forever. Finally my departure is over, my legs are sore and tired and I don't want to move from my seat or even touch the ground of @ORGANIZATION1. The floors were dirty and dirty, the apartment complex was old and over-occupied, and the rain and mud didn't help my attitude much. Everything about this place is disgusting, the thought of sharing a room with my brother makes me sick. I walked out the door, walked into my apartment, and went straight to my dimly lit room. I sat down and collected my thoughts, trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation. The walls caved in towards me, they seemed to turn into bars, and I have to admit I couldn't escape until I turned around @NUM1, which has been @NUM2 for over 10 years! I was trapped in my apartment for three days before I wandered outside, but considering it was not normal for me even at the end of @DATE2 it was raining, it wasn't that scary. I don't want to leave my room or apartment, I just want to watch @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons in my room. I feel lonely and out of place, no friends to talk to, my parents don't listen to me, my brother only has @NUM3 so he won't understand. When I learned that I had to go to school the next day, there was no more smile. Aloha Park sounds like a school with lots of money and spoiling rich kids in it, but it's actually quite the opposite. It was an older school and the kids at the time were mostly living in low-income housing. In a way, it's quite comforting to know that I'm living the same way for the time being. The first day of school was scary, it was my first time into a new and unfamiliar place. My teacher is old and grumpy, and she seems to have a big chip on her shoulders. Suddenly, in the hallway, she suddenly held my hand, which was humiliating and definitely not comforting. I heard my new classmates giggle when they saw me, and I thought I would never make any friends. The humiliation was bearable, but the thought of taking this class for the next nine months was an unbelievably frightening one. My teacher sat me next to three boys on the other side of the room, all with the same expressions, a fusion of alienated confusion and territorial pride. The unwelcome feeling is a low-key to the new nervous feeling that surrounds me. I sat down, not realizing what the three boys might have done against me, and surprisingly, the only thing that happened was a series of brief stares and fragmented silences. As the days went on, life got a little more casual again, until the boys started talking about the opposite sex and my attention turned directly to them. I sat there, listening silently, smirking at inappropriate conversations that I clearly shouldn't be involved in. They laughed and snickered and covered their mouths in embarrassment, and I looked at them and thought they were little geniuses in the art of comedy. I wanted to say something that I'd stuck with throughout the conversation, then I took the opportunity to add one of the all-important jokes, and then I quickly mumbled my overly inappropriate sentence. They looked at me bewildered and asked what I said, I wasn't sure how they would take the joke, but I took another chance to repeat it. A group of boys fell silent, only the voices of other students talking to each other, suddenly burst into laughter. I'm glad they have a sense of humour and I have friends and @CAPS1 afterwards.
Laughing @CAPS1 Laughing is an ability that everyone in the world possesses. Not only will it help you make more friends, but it will also make your day smoother. The ability to laugh is very important in this world. Without laughter, days can be dull, sad, and a little depressing. When I see someone laughing, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and makes me laugh with them. By laughing, we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I've experienced firsthand the joy that laughter can bring after I've had a bad time, which is why I believe that having and keeping laughter is extremely important in your life. Not everyone can have a good day all the time. Bad days happen, and when they do, seeing a funny event and laughing about it can turn the day around and make it good. Many people will never agree when they hear "laughing is the shortest distance between two people" or similar statements. A lot of times, we scoff at it and totally disagree. As it turns out, I myself was once one of those people. Most days are not where they could be @CAPS1, plus going to school all day is a little worse. People keep telling me that if I laugh once in a while, I'll probably feel better more often and I @MONTH1 really have fun when I'm involved throughout the day. I never believed them, why should I? How could something as simple as laughing change how I feel about my everyday life? This possibility is unlikely. I didn't think I would change my mind about it until a few years ago. It started as usual, not so good. My hair is a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I can't stop fighting and my brand new phone broke when we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I've decided it's going to be a bad day because so far nothing has been worked out very well. Over time, nothing worse happened, but nothing better. @PERSON1 and I have been traveling around, going to stores and shopping. Finally, on our last stop, we saw a situation. As we sat at the traffic lights, waiting for traffic to pass, I found a strange man sitting alone across the road. The man looked as if he had an injury to his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began to walk like a wounded penguin, barely dragging his feet, bobbing up and down as he moved forward. Seeing this man made me laugh and when I pointed him to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I started to break down too. The man who made me laugh with his crazy way of walking started to change my whole day. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the opposite, possible. Laughter can bring you closer to others and make your day more exciting. As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my perceptions and beliefs about laughter have changed a lot. Laughter is actually the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before this funny guy came, after we finished laughing at him, we realized that in a few minutes we were closer than ever. It's crazy to think of an event that can change the way you think about some firm belief, but it happened, and that day is now a memory I'll forever cherish. I'm glad it happened because as a result of it I started to see laughter differently and how it affects certain situations in my life. I now consider laughter to be one of the greatest pastimes and do it regularly.
This is the seventh time @DATE1 has invited my two best friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to join me at my boyfriend's football game. This will be the first time they see him because he is different from the high school we went to. Our plan is to drop off at my house and my @CAPS3 will take us to his game later. When we got to the end of the driveway, we started walking towards my house. Then all of a sudden "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa me @PERSON2 a uhhhhh!" @PERSON2 and I almost stepped on a dead snake lying in the driveway. When this happened, @PERSON1 had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked back at her and saw the utterly puzzled look on her face, which we thought was absolutely hilarious, so we burst out laughing. She soon found out that we were startled by snakes and started saying "You guys are so funny @CAPS2 just a dead snake". We talked and laughed and walked all the way to my house. @CAPS4 We caught up a little, I've changed into my boyfriend's #@NUM1 jersey and we're downstairs for dinner. We sat at the table with a bowl of chili and started eating. My @CAPS3 came over to put her bowl down and went back to the kitchen to get something. When she came back, she had napkins and another bowl, and I jokingly asked her "Are you really hungry @CAPS3?" She said, "No... uh, why?" That's when I and the girls Started laughing hysterically again, "@CAPS3 you got two bowls, you're obviously hungry" I giggled. She blushed and replied, "Okay, I do love chili, I can't seem to get enough" before smiling, "You're probably right, I should start with a bowl." @CAPS4 us Collected blankets for the bleachers that left. On our way up the mountain we made a pit stop at the famous @ORGANIZATION1. I had the pleasure of meeting my boyfriend and having my friends over, coffee might not have been the best idea but we stopped anyway. While we were there waiting for our coffee, we passed the time by grimacing at people who happened to drive by through a nearby window. We rage at the looks people give us, some look like @CAPS5 thinks it's funny, others look like @CAPS5 thinks we've escaped from a lunatic asylum. Soon our drinks were ready and we headed out. Then, as we got to the car, someone whistled at us. We jumped in the car and got lost when we saw someone in a Statue of Liberty costume. We're almost at school and I'm energized by the mix of caffeine and excitement. My @CAPS3 had never driven to @PERSON3's school before and my dad was just busy that night. I tried to stay calm while showing her the way in a very giggle way. I started saying "you go straight to @CAPS3" and my @CAPS3 and girl said "you can't go straight to here honey". "Yes, you can" I argued and then @CAPS4 a moment later @PERSON1 said "Girl looks like you can go straight, but if you do you won't see @PERSON3". I realized @CAPS5 was right and told my @CAPS3 "don't turn, just turn right" she was confused because I said the wrong direction so she turned left. I started freaking out, screaming "No no no! We have to turn around, I mean right" @CAPS5 all laughed at me "Men calm women, we just have to turn around" @PERSON2 said. We're finally back on track and I'm trying to give clear direction. I wasn't entirely sure where his school closed, so I told my @CAPS3 to slow down and as we passed it I freaked out again. "@CAPS1 @CAPS3 we have to turn around" @CAPS5 all laughed, then my @CAPS3 said she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and jumped out to pay and entered. We got there just in time to see these guys coming out of the locker room. I got excited again, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started walking away so I could wave to @PERSON3. I put on their shirts and begged them to stay because I didn't want to be the only one waiting. Then I saw him run over, and before I knew it I jumped up from the ground and waved frantically. I saw him smile as he ran onto the court, my friends laughed at the way I was jumping, and we enjoyed the game.
Outdoors @CAPS1 I went to the outdoors @CAPS1 in 6th grade I got up early to go to @CAPS1 where there are buses taking students to the outdoors @CAPS1. First, I boarded my way to the outdoors @CAPS1. Then they told us which cabin we should be in and I had seven cabin crew members including myself. I brought my electronic device, but the teacher told us that we cannot travel without any device. We did some activities the next day and we had lunch before doing any activities. The food we ate was pizza and pizza pockets and hot dogs and then the activity we did was catch some fish and put them back in the water and we just checked them and the other activity we did was hike on our way up to see the deer in Grazing, I was really tired, and then when we got back, we were getting ready to go home. In the end I wanted to help and I really enjoyed my field trips.
@CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When I'm with my family, we have such a great time together that we always laugh at us saying things we remember or memories. When we all sit around the table, whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, we always have something fun to say and laugh about. First off, we all had a great time at @TIME1's first thing during breakfast at @DATE2 @TIME1, but when my sister suddenly remembered what happened at her work the day before, she had to talk about it It's because she wants us to know what's going on so we can laugh with her too. She said there was a banana on the floor and when her manager passed by, she didn't see it and slipped straight out of the hall. Impossible not to laugh because it's the manager. Well, thinking about what happened to Banana and the manager that day, @TIME1 flies so fast. Every time I think about it I start laughing hard. This is the funniest thing she has told us since she started working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that day. I answered quickly but had no idea why she was calling. All of a sudden she said "@CAPS3 you won't believe what just happened, your dog just got out of the shower and is running wild on the bed and couch trying to get dry" I couldn't believe it and I started laughing It was so good that I had to tell my friends next to me and they started laughing too. If I were there watching her run around like a mad dog, I could just imagine in my mind how much fun it would be. Over time all I have to do is remember how funny dogs are doing this and I would start laughing all of a sudden in my school class but even when I was laughing well I would stop laughing because everyone was staring look. Finally, when it was time to eat, we told each other about our day at the dinner table that night. Everyone has something new to say, but when my brother started telling us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because what he wanted to say was so funny, he was just laughing. He paused for a moment and calmed down, but not for long. He told us he went to the bathroom during his lunch break and came out to find all his friends smiling and pointing at him. He said he didn't know what was going on, but when they told him there was a large piece of paper stuck to his pants when he came out of the bathroom. I immediately thought he would be embarrassed, but he said he also found it funny. My parents, sister and I started laughing so hard that we even forgot about the dinner sitting in front of us and just lay cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Every day is different without laughter. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to let your day go by and wait for the next. In the end we all said that our day went by too fast, the day was over and it was time for bed. @DATE1 Day 3 was the best day of many, we all had so much fun and laughed with each other about the funny things that happened to us that day.
I grew up with two brothers who meant the world to me until my little sister was welcomed into the world in the year @DATE1 I am the second of seven, most of my family Members have moved to another world where I know they will be better. Now I've been locked up since I was 12 1/2 away from my family and from the funeral I missed for four long years I'll never cry at a funeral The only funeral I've ever cried for will be when my mother was there This year passed away @DATE2 I will never forget the woman who brought me and others into this world before she passed away, she didn't want me, my brother and my little sister to be separated from each other but that didn't happen with them First child and most importantly seeing my new nieces and nephews welcomed into the world and even watching them grow up in the same world I am. Dude, I remember when it was just me and my brother in @LOCATION1 or that was all fun when we got into trouble, running around the park, meeting new people, parents having a great mom and an amazing dad don't have to worry about anything, Just had a good time until one night my dad hit my mom and that was no more fun the story of a sixteen-year-old girl @CAPS1 @CAPS2.
Laughter is the key to happiness. It's a moment that many people will remember. You share a lot of laughter with friends, family, and sometimes even strangers. When you laugh with someone, it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and can lead to a strong relationship. Laughing means a lot to me, I laugh every day. I won't forget when I was really mad at my dad, and laughter fixed that. One night I was in my kitchen with my dad and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I can still fix them, there is a solution. He said I was a liar and more anger kept building. His mind was so rigid that I couldn't understand what he was thinking. He said I couldn't fix what I'd done: what's been done. I was really pissed I wanted him to go away, I thought I would never talk to him. We lacked trust and I just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I know he'll be more pissed and we'll end up screaming at each other. It made me so angry that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me and he was disappointed. I'm really sad because my dad is the kind of guy who always tells jokes and makes fun of everyone. He always makes me laugh and makes me happy. Usually when he gets me in trouble, it ends with a joke. When I was sad or angry, his jokes made our relationship stronger; we always had the last laugh. Later that night, we cut my niece's cake with my family, and my dad and I didn't speak. When we sang Happy Birthday, I would stare at him and bow my head. He looked at me like he was strong. And then we're all saying "-í @CAPS1 le sople!", which means blowing out the candles in @CAPS2. Suddenly, my uncle accidentally blew out the candle, and my dad and I looked at each other and laughed so hard. We couldn't stop laughing, we couldn't stop laughing. Laughing at the same thing, sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger feels great. My dad would try not to laugh, but the harder he tried, the louder he laughed. Only he and I kept laughing, everyone else was giggling. Because it made my dad and me better, it created a bond between me and my family. It's a memory that will last a lifetime, but it's an important part of my dad's relationship with me. Although he was still upset about my grades, things got better. There is a connection between us and we can still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what made me find it so interesting that night. Because it made my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter, it was all based on memory. I have something in common with him, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem isn't solved, but it doesn't seem like it matters, as if laughing makes you change and helps us put it aside. Every moment of laughter we have right now is something I share with him, and it's a connection now. We can all laugh about the same things, share our thoughts and make us stronger. Tell me that when I laugh at things with him, it's just taking more of the negativity out of the equation and giving life more meaning. When you know you are happy, you have a sense of humor. Also, when you spend those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment you make laughing a big part of your passing. When all these fun moments matter, because that's when you show you're happy. It's even better when you're laughing most of the time, because your memory will be remembered as a happy moment. I know there are times when I don't laugh, but the key is to always look on the bright side. Although my father and I were angry with each other, the memory of it will always be with me.
The @CAPS8 family @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 is an exploration, but one that we kind of regret migrating from @LOCATION3. We miss our friends, our connections, and places. The place next to our farm that @CAPS8 bros and I miss is @CAPS3, which we call "@CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3". The place itself is a junkyard. Approaching a dairy farm, it smelled of cow beats mixed with cigarettes. I remember the grass was drying up forever and the bridge across @CAPS3 kept creaking; it was an old covered bridge at its last stop. So, it's not so much a place we missed, but a happy memory associated with our special place. On a particularly gloomy day, our dad woke us up from our room and said we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. We know the adventures of @CAPS4; we call them "@CAPS4-ventures" because they are truly unique. Most of the time, we end up far away from any civilization, stuck in a car with lunch out of reach. Even when we were young, we started to be wary of "@CAPS4-ventures". @CAPS7, our mother was able to wake up @CAPS8 brother and me, we were quickly squeezed into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably happy. When @CAPS8 bro and I were in the back seat of the car, longing for our nice, comfortable room, @CAPS8 dad had the audacity to laugh into the radio and open the car window to meet our protest. My @CAPS8 brother and I were riding in the back with two inflated round rubber blocks. I'll soon learn that these are called inner tubes and can be used to drift on @CAPS3. After a few hours on the road, we arrived at a place called "@LOCATION2 Bend". Brother @CAPS8 and I jumped out of the car and met the original beauty. In the shade, @CAPS3 was flowing noisily, and although we weren't very close to the @CAPS3 bank, we could hear it. The grass under our feet was green and soft, and the smell of fresh water gushing from the soil was fragrant. Light filters down through the trees, creating a crystalline effect on the water. @CAPS8 brother and I hurried into our swimsuits while @CAPS8 dad started pushing our food and supplies to the @CAPS3 bank where we were going to spend the day. After getting dressed, my brother @CAPS8 and I chased after because it was warm and the water looked nice and cool. When our hunger pangs are satisfied, it's time to pull out the inner tube. The water was nice and fast, with some white water and very little water at the end. As a kid of @CAPS8's age, these little obstacles are like the most sinister rapids, making @CAPS8's eyes go wide. @CAPS7, I managed to steady myself, ready to get wet. On @DATE1, I was clinging to the @CAPS8 inner tube, fingers clenched, eyes wild, but gradually, I loosened up. I let @CAPS8's hands float out and drag casually behind me in the water, making circles as the sun seeps through the trees. As the water got faster and faster, I started to get scared again. I took a quick breath as the waterfall approached me. Actually, it's only four feet tall, but in the haze of @CAPS8 panic, that four feet looks like twelve feet. White water suddenly rushed towards me, accompanied by a loud, terrifying scream from me. Somehow I managed to make ends meet and the @CAPS8 ride made me smile. I burst into a long laugh, laughing off all the nostalgia and sadness of @CAPS8. @CAPS8 bro coming down from the waterfall, giggling, we laughed together. Our laughter healed us and we felt totally at home during our @DATE1 hours after moving.
Falling in love, @CAPS3 @CAPS1 The falling part was easy, I remember the moment I fell in love with you. Everything about you shines, everything about you shines. You are infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We have the greatest pleasure a human being can have. Every time we're together, I don't think we're unhappy together, let alone worry about you leaving. I never imagined my life without you. As a kid I always had the title of always smiling kid, @CAPS4 I get this glow when I think of you. Everyone saw it. They'll ask, "@CAPS2 what have you been doing? You're so happy, I've never seen you like this before." What they see in me @CAPS2 is the power of love. @CAPS4 What they don't see is our @CAPS2 together. When it's just me @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 one of us will do something @CAPS3 none of us can stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt so badly by @CAPS1. That's what I love @CAPS2 and I've grown to love every part of you. Especially your laughter. From @CAPS2 I heard, they say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I will have to agree. It's amazing to be able to laugh with someone, @CAPS3 to be yourself @CAPS3 doesn't have to insist on that. It makes a relationship last. I guess it's kind of like glue in a sense. My brother @CAPS3 I'm the closest thing to a best friend, @CAPS3 Guess @CAPS2 what do we do in our spare time? We laugh. He's someone I can be stupid @CAPS3 stupid @CAPS3 stupid @CAPS3 He still laughs, @CAPS3 he still loves me. :) @CAPS4, even though he's my brother, he still has the same respect, @CAPS1 is great. It is also a stress reliever. This is what my teacher told me. That's my health teacher.
Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether it's a relative, friend, or someone you're dating. Laughter makes you forget about troubles and troubles. But when do you trade laughter for seriousness in a friendship built on laughter? I believe laughter is crucial in friendship. But to build strong, healthy relationships, you also need a certain level of seriousness. This is the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships. Olivia has been my best friend for as long as I can remember and we hang out a lot. Laughter has always been an important part of our friendship and always will be. But entering middle school, we were faced with drama, boys, and arguments that we had never experienced before. All these small but important things to us then add up and start to tear us apart. Our lack of sharing our feelings, and instead covering it up with laughter, leads to our pent-up anger towards each other. I've always thought we were the perfect match for best friends because of the countless inside jokes we had and the constant fun we'd have. But our anger kept growing until we were ready to deal with it, which we didn't understand at the time. We started hanging out less and less and our daily call became once a week. We both noticed a change in our friendship but didn't know how to fix it, we apologized for our bickering and sympathized with our boy's troubles, but it's not the same. I miss her, but it gets easier not to talk or hang out the longer it goes. Summer is here and our mom plans me to stay at her house for a week while my parents To put it nicely, I'm not that excited, how can I be there for a week when we're barely talking anymore? I know it's going to be alright, but I'm still worried that this week will be more battles than laughter. Finally one day, my parents drove me to her house. When I got there everything was fine, we pretended nothing happened and had a good time for a few days. But on the third day, she broke the ice and asked what was wrong and why we stopped talking. An amazing thing happened that day, we talked about all our feelings and what was upsetting us. It was a little awkward at first, but we got through it together. Fighting less and less because we know each other's troubles, everything is slowly getting better than before. That conversation changed our relationship forever and I'm glad she said it when I didn't, otherwise we wouldn't be as close as we are today. That day was @DATE1 but had a huge impact on our friendship. Since our milestone in our friendship, I know better how to be more open with other people. Olivia taught me a lot, but this is an even bigger lesson. Laughter is an important part of any strong relationship, but you also need to be able to share your feelings and take them seriously. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with me, and I'm glad it kept me going no matter what.
Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry of a couple, but also the happiness between family and friends. How depressing would the world be without laughter? It's like "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4". The joyful laughter of a connection lets you get to know someone better and shows them that you have a warm heart. Ideally, when someone has a warm heart, your conscience will tell you that you can trust them. The talent for laughter is a great element when you meet new people and spend time with your family. Last time @DATE1, my youth group and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1 for a mission. As we host a week of @ORGANIZATION2 events in @CAPS5 town, we will be reaching out to many new kids. We pick up the kids from their house and drive them to @ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing. When we meet each child one by one, it is important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we came to their neighborhood with a serious face in a 12-bus white van, it would send a different message to the kids. Instead, we adorned our cars with Crayola paint markers and hopped out of the van with big smiles. We ran to a door, rang the bell, and asked parents if their kids wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We have to remember that these children live in poverty and go through a lot. In order to share the gospel, it's important to show them that we're friendly so they can open up to us, let's tell them @CAPS6. When we laugh with our children, their eyes are always smiling. A lot of kids just need love, and we do that by laughing with them and joking with each other. There is no doubt that our youth groups have changed the lives of children. Our @ORGANIZATION2 may be one of their biggest highlights of the year. At @ORGANIZATION1, the town looks as flat as a desert, with no playgrounds, parks, or places where they can go and have fun. @CAPS8 empowers us to share the gospel with these kids and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. @CAPS8 opened the hearts of @CAPS5 kids to @MONTH1 to hear what @CAPS8 has to say. I honestly don't think we could have reached them if we weren't a friendly bunch. It just goes to show how important it is to laugh with others, whether with strangers or family. If your family isn't laughing and laughing, there's a problem. It's a sign of broken relationships and a loss of intimacy. In commercials, there are always ads of families around the table or laughing together in a restaurant. Not everyone has to look like that perfect family picture every day, but when a family laughs at each other, it shows the unity they have. Usually, when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and respect each other. Of course, family doesn't have to be related, it can be your youth group, your friends, or whoever you feel close and comfortable with. The person you are comfortable with might even be your future spouse. My cousin's story about how he met his wife is like a scene from a chick movie. My cousin @PERSON1 was working at the ski resort and was waxing skis at the rental checkout when a brunette in baggy snow pants came up to him and said, "I can go down the biggest hill", and The most flirtatious eyes and smiles. Now, @PERSON1 is confused as to why this girl came up to him and said it straight to him. But @PERSON1 is so captivated by this beautiful girl that all he can say is "@CAPS9". The girl seemed very satisfied with his answer and asked him when the next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 was having lunch with the girl in the cafeteria. It turned out that the girl's name was "@PERSON2". Apparently @PERSON2's friends first spotted @PERSON1 and told @PERSON2 that the guy had a good laugh and looked like a good guy. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out to get to know him. @PERSON2, being a bold person, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves that laughter matters. You don't know how @CAPS2 @MONTH1 hears your voice and how that person will affect your future. Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings spiritual joy to people, gives you the opportunity to meet new people, and maybe change their lives. It reflects who you are @CAPS2 and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, don't we want our world to be like "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 laughter"?
Laughter is part of life. If it doesn't taste good, it can help bring people together, or even separate them. There was a time when my cousin @PERSON1 and I didn't really like each other, but I had to stay at his house because my mom wasn't in town. After that night, we were closer than brothers, and there was a huge funny story behind it. I didn't even want to go there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and try to have some fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents told us they were going out and they wouldn't be home until very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin, @PERSON1 turned to me and said "you want to do something really fun." @CAPS1 I couldn't help being interested when I was thirteen. So I asked him what was so funny and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and walked through his fields to a wall of blackberry bushes around his field and he showed me a path through a certain spot. After passing through the bushes, we came to a gravel road leading to a house with lots of land around it. In this land my cousin thinks it's a fainting goat, I don't know what a fainting goat is. So my cousin said he should show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to the goats when there was a loud bang and about a quarter of them just fell to the ground, stiff. These goats faint when they're scared and I can't help but laugh. We spent about forty-five minutes scaring them and watching them pass out. No matter how many times we did it, we found it to be no more fun than the first time. The funniest thing that happened that night started when @PERSON1 told me he brought the @NUM1 fireworks. We put it where all the goats gather and light it. It rang, with a thud as loud as a gunshot. As a group, the goats all went down and we all laughed until everyone in the house came out. We ran like our lives depended on it, we flew over the blackberry trail, across the fields, and headed straight for @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch and we looked at each other and we laughed so hard that my ribs were hurting and I was dizzy laughing. After we had calmed down for about a minute, his parents came home, which we also thought was very funny. As soon as they went to bed, we burst into silent laughter. That was one of the funniest times I had with my cousin, even tough, we didn't like each other before, we ended up being brothers other than blood, but we're cousins, so maybe even a little bit Blood ties, but mostly brothers laughing.
Laughing is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It doesn't require translation or dictionary lookup. This is a form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS9 boundaries. @CAPS5 is the most taciturn girl in school. During mornings and lunches, @CAPS5 hides in the shadows, hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 Ask @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wants to be, @CAPS5 will say invisible. People pass @CAPS8 without even looking, thinking @CAPS4 I can't see @CAPS8 not @CAPS5 doesn't exist. I feel sorry for this poor girl because I know @CAPS5 needs a friend. @CAPS5 Someone to talk to or at least get a smile on. But what would I do with @CAPS8? Will @CAPS5 think I'm crazy? I know there has to be a way to get @CAPS8 to talk, or at least smile. When I walked into the school on @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the usual hustle and bustle. The paper plane flies in one direction and the mouth flies in the other direction. I'm used to being pushed and ducked on the way to class. It's just an interesting journey into the @DATE1 period. Finally, as I entered the fourth session with my clumsy self, I sat down and started looking for the pencil. As I did this, I noticed that someone pulled @DATE1's chair to me and sat down. It's that girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 was in class with me, let alone sitting on @DATE1 for me. I started ecstatic, knowing this might be my chance. Also, I started thinking about how to start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed someone drew a photo on the front of the @CAPS8 binder. At the bottom is the @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 to draw that photo. "@CAPS1," @CAPS5 said in a very calm voice. My heart was pounding, and I almost broke free from my chest. I know what I have to say. "@CAPS2," I began, "I believe @CAPS10 is a very good artist. Any other photos of @CAPS10?" "@CAPS1," added @CAPS5, "but they are all at home. " Is there any possible way for me @MONTH1 to see these other photos of you?" I said happily. "@CAPS4 @CAPS10 thought, @CAPS10 would love to see them at my house after school today." @CAPS5 said in a very happy voice. "I'll be honored," I said. When we finished the conversation, the teacher started the @CAPS8 class. @CAPS5 What a good girl, I thought to myself. I can't wait for @DATE1 to end. As school @DATE1 was coming to an end, we pointed to each other in the foyer. I can tell @CAPS5 is very excited. As @CAPS2, I'm excited to know that @CAPS5 is finally confident in himself; like a bird flying out of its nest for the first time. We drove a powerful truck to @CAPS8's house. When we got to the front door, I got really nervous. My beating heart flew out of my chest when @CAPS5 opened it. The house is absolutely beautiful. It smells of freshly baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I couldn't believe what was in front of me. My mind can't understand all of this. @CAPS8 mom shouted from another room: "Is that @CAPS10 baby?" "@CAPS1 mom," @CAPS5 replied, "I have a friend over here." "@CAPS7!" @CAPS8 mom exclaimed . We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mum before we went to the @CAPS8 room. The @CAPS8 room is filled with many beautiful drawings by @CAPS5. @CAPS5 told me that there is a story behind each of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I've painted before. "@CAPS9," I said, "I'm what @CAPS10 calls an art world challenger." We all laughed. However, we all started to draw a picture. In all this, I took a look at the @CAPS8 picture. This is a beautiful picture of a fairy tale world full of castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my photo. Drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds was a failed attempt. We looked at each other and started laughing hysterically. "@CAPS10's cloud looks like a potato," @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder, and we continued to laugh for an hour. Finally, when I leave the house and go home for the night. I realized some amazing things, I forgot some things. It doesn't take much to connect with people who need friends. I also realize this is probably the easiest thing to make @CAPS10 laugh about; like a bad picture. This is because laughter is contagious, and we all know we all love to laugh.
"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people," @CAPS3's famous quote can be shared by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have fun. Especially @CAPS1 and the people you care about. @CAPS1 is something you and others can easily do together. @CAPS3 brings two people closer and brightens one's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for someone who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguments are not going to be a major part of the @CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who can make you laugh is a key factor in life. When I was sixteen, I had my first boyfriend. I'm the girl who keeps rejecting guys and telling them I'm trying to wait for the perfect guy. On @DATE2 I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he's older than me and we may be on opposite sides, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his lovely smile. After getting to know him and on the phone a few times, I realized I was starting to have feelings for the @CAPS3 boy. He always calls me @CAPS1 whenever we talk. I find @CAPS3 very appealing. Having someone who can bring sunshine into my life makes me feel like I'm on top of the world. There is a football game on @DATE1, @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools are rivals). He and I haven't dated during @CAPS3. I invited him over to watch the game with me that day. I told him before how much I love plush toys. He showed up that day with a fluffy stuffed toy. We were walking around the track and @CAPS2 suddenly I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laughter. He put his arms around me and whispered in my ear: "I'll never let you @DATE3." I turned cherry red. From that day on, he'll remember me as a bumbling girl who stumbles a lot. Now that I look back on that day, I realize how interesting that memory was. Looking back on awkward moments is always a good thing in a relationship. @CAPS2 You're looking for someone you want to spend the rest of your life with and you have to make sure you like them. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone you can have fun with and have some fun with. I always tell my friends "@CAPS1 is a great ab workout." It's true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends and laugh at random things is something I've always looked forward to. Without @CAPS1, it means I'm not having a good time. But luckily, I have great friends who joke about everything. @CAPS2 I'm never @CAPS1 whenever I'm around them. Being able to make others laugh is one of the hallmarks of a person. @CAPS2 You meet someone new and you'd rather have an awkward silence? Or do you prefer people who make you laugh? I wish we had the same answer because I hate awkward silences. I need to know someone @CAPS3 that will make me laugh and smile, not make me think "@CAPS2 can I leave?" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone wants to go through, I can speak from personal experience Say @CAPS3. Even though I'm not the best at telling jokes, I take advantage of all the embarrassing moments, that's how I have @CAPS1 guys. I'm not angry, I'm the complete opposite. I laugh with them. I know I'm clumsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things bring a smile to a person, I'm fine @PERCENT1. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 They were disappointed. So I'm not kidding, just reminding them of an embarrassing thing that happened to me. Everyone has their own unique way. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways to make others laugh. Once a guy makes a girl laugh, that's the first sign that @CAPS3 guys are ready for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means you had a good time. @CAPS1 brings people together. @CAPS1 can brighten up one's life. So the next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice.
My mom always said that laughter is a great doctor, for me anyway. I always laugh at a good joke whenever I'm sick or injured, it makes me feel a little better when my family goes on a long trip, we always joke and make fun of each other, and soon the trip seems Not long at all. It's short and you wish it could be longer. My family and I came home from the store one night and my brother asked "what are we having for dinner tonight" "hamburgers" she told us my brother was a little freaked out because we didn't get @ORGANIZATION1 and my mom said very Well then, my dad hopped in the car at a little shop called @CAPS1 and started driving home. "I want Mexican food tonight, can we have it at @ORGANIZATION2's tonight" my mom asked "no, I thought we were going to have hamburgers tonight" he replied "we don't have @ORGANIZATION1's" my mom laughed. Then my dad stopped the car and turned "why" we all asked "we don't have @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1 have at least some chips" and we all started laughing. Once we got to the place and found a place to sit and we were all talking, my sister burst out "Look at Daddy, I can move the straw instead of just looking at it" and she stared at the straw in the cup and everyone All fell silent. I knew it wouldn't move, so I tapped the straw to make it move "Ha, it moved" She smiled knowing she didn't move the straw. My mom tried to hold back a laugh because my dad thought for a second that she could move the straw just by looking at it. "I can't believe I've been fooled" We finished our meal, laughing all the way home. Laughter can bring family, friends and even enemies together, and sometimes I laugh so hard that I can't breathe. Laughter brings joy to life, knowing that other people have the same interest, you @MONTH1 gained a friend you never knew, like my family and @LOCATION1 travel everyone laughed. When it snowed one day, I pulled out my phone, called my neighbors and my siblings to the park, and we had an idea for snowball fights and capture the flag. We all chose our bases and the type of flags we wanted and started a game we had a lot of fun laughing so hard that it hurt, not long before I realized it, at the point of our conversation After a day I got to know my neighbor better next time we have a snowball fight and know each other better and I hope she is on my team and we will definitely win.
My cousin @PERSON1 and I are constantly laughed at, he is the funniest person I know. He's hilarious when he doesn't want to. I believe that's why he's so @NUM1king interesting. @PERSON1 is a hardcore alcoholic who is always drunk or drunk. On the rare occasion when neither option did, he was the most boring, frustrated, angry, and uninteresting person around. Give him a drink or two and watch him transform into a funny @CAPS1. @PERSON1 and I had a great time with alcoholic beverages on or near him. Seeing this shift happening, @CAPS5 is an awesome thing. He started out as this sad, depressed, sober sociopathic lion in the zoo, where there are so many judgmental, sour, pathetic excuses that men and women point at this poor lion, laughing and sobbing. When one of these "people" tossed a beer his way, he'd bite @CAPS5 with his ferocious, angry teeth and swallow @NUM2 ounces of @CAPS2 tall boy in seconds - ok ! Then he stood up with his huge cat paws, purring in an astonishingly low vibrato. His big, ferocious cat-tooth smiles like a @LOCATION1 lion, and his sickly, beastly, blood-stained fur slowly transforms into the scaly, scarred skin of a man. When he stood there with stupid idiot shit! While eating a smile he yells "I @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @PERSON1!!" @CAPS5 is really an amazing thing, I've watched @CAPS5 so many times, I definitely @CAPS6 found a word to describe it This wonderful reconstruction of the creature. Then with wine in hand, we'll move on to a night of hilarious entertainment that no one knows about. I guess you could say that laughter is an important part of our relationship.
One day my friends and I went to a friend's house and we started playing with the @CAPS1 box and we had a good laugh. My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk and @CAPS5 was laughing so hard that the milk started coming out of his nose which was funny but also disgusting at the same time. @CAPS6 is the saddest one of the whole team, we all asked him, @CAPS4 is @CAPS5 very sad @CAPS5 replied that @CAPS5 heard that his girlfriend wants to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested and we said @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said @CAPS5 would consider @CAPS6 to be a real fun guy and great to hang out with, so we weren't that worried, we thought everything would be fine. So after @CAPS5 left, we started hanging out in my friend @CAPS7's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the sexiest girl at school. An hour has passed and my friend @CAPS6 is back. @CAPS5 came over and sat with us and yelled that I don't work, I'm like nothing to calm down, @CAPS9 Happened I asked? It's not funny that @CAPS5 says she thinks I'm stupid and stupid. Oh she's really talking silly, I thought she knew, everyone laughed, no @CAPS6 I'm just messing with you, man don't be mad, come on now. So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me, @CAPS5 left and we all started laughing I think @CAPS5 is just hurt and @CAPS5 will get over it. An hour passed and my phone started ringing and I checked who was calling, it was @CAPS6's ex-girlfriend. I was surprised I replied, I told her @CAPS6 wasn't with us, I'd tell him to call you later, I said because @CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to you Me, so I'm fine, so we started talking and she told me she liked me...and I started laughing. She was sad and angry with me because I laughed. But I told her it was cool to do so I told her I had to go and we hung up...I couldn't help but start breaking down again so my day just ended in laughter like that all day
Laughter is an extremely important aspect of maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some very beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any stressful or stressful situation, and connecting with others in a more meaningful way. Laughter is also a great way to make new friends. I think healthy relationships, whether friendships or larger friendships, can hardly exist without laughter and cannot thrive without laughter. For these reasons, I personally use laughter on a daily basis and it is an important part of my relationship with my father's family. A concrete example of how I use this basic tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members I haven't seen in a long time. Laughter is an important element in my entire family relationship with my father, without which small family meetings and full family reunions would not exist. Since they are scattered across @LOCATION2 and few people live near @LOCATION1, visiting with these family members is a rare opportunity. The most admirable quality on my father's side is the innate sense of humor that everyone has. Laughter seems to be just another form of communication in our family and the main reason we get along so well. The relationships I share with individual family members can also be observed at each family gathering. Just on @DATE1, my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set for @DATE2. There is a concrete example of this incident where laughter was a major element of the relationship between me and one of my family members. Not only do I have to be the only one there, but I also have to sit at a table with an aunt I haven't seen in over a year. While we've enjoyed each other's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sat in complete silence throughout the celebration. My sister's baby shower day inevitably came, and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with decorations and other amenities and found my seat. Ten minutes after doing this, my auntie and table mate entered and found her seat next to me. No matter how nervous I was, the first thing my aunt did was to ease my inner tension and remind me why I got along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me with a joke that I was the only one in the shower. During the party, all I heard was the aunt's jokes and the laughter the two of us shared. As family members and good friends, we reconnected and reconnected, and the use of laughter was the reason for it all. Through the use of laughter, my aunt and I reconnected and was probably the funniest of all the attendees. Whether we were joking around with some party favors or just enjoying a ridiculous game, my aunt and I were laughing hysterically. On this particular day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but the only reason I had a friendly relationship with my aunt.
LaughterLaughter can change a lot of people, it can bring people together. It also helps build relationships, and making each other laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS2 The laughter of you and your friends can and will always be there, I know it's with my friends. @CAPS2 You're in a relationship or friendship, @CAPS1 it's important to be able to laugh with that person because it makes you feel more connected to them, @CAPS2 You have a large group of new friends you can laugh with, this Better because then you know where you are. My best friend and I were laughing all the time, @CAPS3 could look at me in a way I can only understand, I'd know what @CAPS3 meant, and then we all started laughing @CAPS2 We stood in a big group of friends and we started big Lol, they all looked at us funny. Then usually we tell them what they are laughing about and most of the time they don't understand. My best friend and I are always together, except for school, we are always laughing, whether it's something that happened a day or a year ago. My best friend and I have a lot of inside jokes, we just need to take them out once and if something funny happens, we'll start laughing again. In a relationship like having a "boyfriend" or "girlfriend," one of the good things about things is that they make them happy, laugh, and enjoy being with you. My boyfriend does this to me, no matter if I'm in a bad mood, he always tries to put a smile on my face and it works most of the time. @CAPS2 You have a boyfriend or girlfriend and you always want to try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over silly little things. Boys don't get mad at @CAPS2, they want to hang out with their friends there. The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate each other if they do in a way you can hang out with your boyfriend and your best friend someday way to solve another problem. I have a great relationship because my best friend is dating my boyfriend's best friend so we can both hang out and not fight if we really want to. It's nice to have friends with all of us so we can go to the beach together and we can go out to eat together. At this point we are thinking of planning a trip to the coast but not quite sure about going there for a day. I think the best way to have a great relationship full of laughter is to give it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend because if you break up you don't have friends because they don't want to be with you anymore because you left them with your boyfriend at the time friend. So I always try to tell my boyfriend not to make it sound wrong. Usually, these people understand that you have a life too, it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did this once, @CAPS3 wasn't happy in the relationship, @CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything, @CAPS3 was afraid to break up with him even though because @CAPS3 doesn't have any friends, because @CAPS3 make him her life. Laughter always makes you feel better, it's kind of like a healing process, it's always there, it's just whether someone can make you laugh. Their people can make you laugh, @CAPS4 and videos and family. @CAPS2 You are with someone who makes you happy, like you are around them with joy and enjoyment, you care about them, you feel comfortable around them. If you have struggles and get over them, and they still make you laugh and be happy, you know they are your happy people to laugh around with. Family always makes you laugh when you don't want to or don't want to, I love my dad and he always knows how to make me laugh.
@CAPS1 @CAPS2 I sit in the living room with the @CAPS3 family and talk about every @ORGANIZATION1 We always have the last laugh. A @ORGANIZATION1, we were out at @CAPS3 great grandfather's house, we just opened our presents, in the middle of the floor was @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 cousin @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was inside @CAPS2. At first we tried to convince @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS3 Dad talking to Uncle @CAPS3 outside. @ORGANIZATION2 don't believe us despite @CAPS3 dad talking outside. @ORGANIZATION2 circled @CAPS2, watched @CAPS2, sure @CAPS3 dad was in there. Then @ORGANIZATION2 started poking @CAPS2. We laughed because it was so cute that @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was in @CAPS2. He kept saying "I know he's in there". @ORGANIZATION2 opened @CAPS2, @CAPS3 Dad is not in it. @CAPS3 Dad came into the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started laughing too. Later at @TIME1, @ORGANIZATION2 was playing in another room trying to show @CAPS3 dad the toy he was playing with. So @CAPS3 Daddy climbed on @CAPS2 and we told @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS3 Daddy was outside. @ORGANIZATION2 went out looking for him, but @CAPS3 Dad wasn't there. When @ORGANIZATION2 came in, he checked every room and couldn't find the @CAPS3 dad. After a while @ORGANIZATION2 was standing next to @CAPS2 when @CAPS3 dad jumped out and freaked out @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 screamed like little girls and we all laughed so hard. @ORGANIZATION2 was angry at first, then he started laughing too. At the time @ORGANIZATION2 was only five so when @CAPS3 dad jumped at him he was really scared. @ORGANIZATION2 thought it would be fun to scare @CAPS3 dad so @ORGANIZATION2 hid in @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad came in and we told @CAPS3 dad to look for @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3 Dad called his name looked at every room and pretended not to find @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing because @CAPS3 dad acted like he was going to sit on @ORGANIZATION2 which made him laugh super hard. When @ORGANIZATION2 quit @CAPS2 he was like "how did you know I was in @CAPS2?" @CAPS3 dad said "well you started laughing silly." Of all the @ORGANIZATION1 I think @ORGANIZATION1 is history Best ever @ORGANIZATION1. That's when laughter brings the two together.
When you're in some kind of relationship with anyone, you usually start joking and silly. Whether you want to flirt with them, or just be a fun person and make a good first impression. Usually all these things make people laugh; even if they really have no reason to do so. Anyone who is shy in front of new people is likely to laugh at anything they say. If it's someone you already know, you probably always giggle at something. You can have different types of relationships with different people, and laughter is almost always the number one way to keep it together. When you develop a deep friendship with someone, you are already very close. Your laughing, crying, and arguing with that person will make your relationship stronger. Sometimes you spend time with another person and it's a step in the direction of sticking together. In my experience, I would be close friends for a long time; then we would fight and stop being friends. Although we fought and didn't want to talk, we became good friends again because we laughed together all the time. Being sad all the time and having no one to laugh at makes us realize how much we miss each other. Even meeting new people was easy; it didn't last as long as my friendship with another person. Really, when you meet someone for the first time, whether it's a boy or a girl, you laugh almost all the time. This might even be what it looks like. Once you've known someone for so long, you can know what kind of relationship you're going to have with them. The connection you make with them is simple; you can get along, or you can argue all the time. No matter what kind of relationship you have with an acquaintance, it's likely always been the same. When you're not that close to another person, you tend not to care about friendship as often. You won't be as emotional, although your experience with them will always make people laugh. The time you spend with anyone should always be fun and laughter. Another form of laughter can be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend. In my opinion, you create a special bond with your significant other. When two people choose to be together, they choose to spend time getting to know each other on different levels. The fun and laughter they will create can lead them to a higher level of love, just like you do with your best friend. Couples should laugh together and enjoy each other's happy times. Making each other laugh brings their friendship closer; they become comfortable with each other. Laughing and sharing time together, they will gain more confidence and ability. The laughter you laugh with anyone, builds any type of relationship. Often, the first impression will determine your connection with the person. There is always some way for you to act with one person and not the other. The three most common different types of friendships are: acquaintances, boyfriend/girlfriends, and close friends. All the friends you make, the people you meet, bring a lot of laughter.
What a laugh if not a smile, a small piece of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, the chocolate oozing from the side like a waterfall. Laughter can come from a joke, an embarrassing situation, or anything. Laughter can be a bond of friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a real story about laughter and how it affected my own relationship. It was my first day of high school and I walked into the school and looked down at my shoes. I could feel everyone around me staring, but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them smiling or keep silent, so I didn't say anything. I went to the office and asked them how to find drama classes, they gave me a map I didn't know how to read, and sent me away. At this point I was already scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me instead of "sorry" or even a polite "@CAPS2 me" he looks at me in disgust and continues down the hallway. It took me some time, but I finally found my drama class. The teacher was not very nice to me, as if she hated everyone. She's a bit rounder and has short blond hair. Her name is @PERSON1 and I'm not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me who looked just as scared as I was. For the first @NUM1 minutes of class, we looked at each other a few times, but we didn't say anything. Halfway through the get out of class, the girl next to me asked my name, and I answered "@CAPS3" very calmly. When I turned to leave, she whispered to me, got my attention, smiled and said, "@CAPS4 @CAPS5 look what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?" I started hysterical. laugh. The big teacher lurking in front of me said, "@CAPS5 Two, hallway, now!" I don't know if laughing is an option, but when I walked out of that door there was a smile on my face and I fell laughing on the floor. I can't control myself. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's funny that we got into trouble, but this bitter teacher is such a disappointment. Drama teachers should be fun and friendly, at least that's what I thought. The next class I walked through the auditorium door and found myself near a seat in the back next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like she was spit on by a baby, a pair of light blue skinny jeans that didn't flatter her figure, and a pair of pink @NUM2" heels. She's in a good mood today, @CAPS5 can tell by the big smile on her face. When anyone spoke, she would burn a whole thing on her forehead with her eyes. It's like being stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We'd all laugh behind her back, but that's how we lived through her class. After a few minutes of talking, she sent us to @CAPS4 for our first scene. The people in my group are @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 I met in algebra the day before, and a girl I don't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We both got to know each other very quickly because we both enjoyed the joy of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1' montae is @CAPS9 @CAPS10 and @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae is @NUM3 inches taller than me. Her hair is only blonde with bangs. She is amazingly beautiful. @CAPS8 is a quiet man, @CAPS4 is a lonely man. She is about @NUM4 inches shorter than me and she has short black hair. It's straight, as I'll soon learn it's always been. She's stylish and wears the cutest brown belt and shoes with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screams cute. We laughed all the time, made fun of the teacher, told jokes. We barely got any work done. That was a day I will never forget. To this day, I'm still a good friend of the three of them, we talk a lot about that day, and we're so glad we met. So, as @CAPS5 sees, laughter is a huge part of my relationships. It's a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even if @CAPS5 barely knows someone, @CAPS5 quickly discovers that laughter leads to friendship. It's like spending a while in your favorite place on earth. Laughter is a great way to get close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time you're with your friends or group with strangers, tell them a joke. priceless!
Many people sing and write stories about sad and depressing events as if it were the only part of life. We never seem to stop and focus on the little things. If we can stop and appreciate these little things, everyone will realize how much they really have. In some way, we're all looking for mercy, and for some reason, we want worse stories. It's like some kind of competition. I personally don't want a worse story. If you just "go with the flow", things seem easier and carefree, and people prefer to be with people who make them feel good and happy, rather than people who make them sad. A lot of times, I could have chosen to stay angry and frustrated, but I chose to just laugh instead of making a fuss about a small mistake. For example, @DATE1 is the @CAPS1 dance. I should have been there early to finish decorating, but I was late (as usual). It didn't matter that I was late because when I got there, I found out it was cancelled. When they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage), my parents had already driven away and they didn't have their phones with them. I'm stuck at school. When I was trying to get someone to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them the dance was canceled. My friend's mom came to pick us up very warmly. We met other friends downtown and we decided to go to @LOCATION1 to play arcade games. We had a great time! We both have matching rings and I have two lollipops. After finishing, we went to a friend's house where we watched a movie and ate popcorn. I eat a lot of sugar, super super! I've been saying a whole bunch of random things, but it made for a great night full of laughter. I could have been very upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could, but we made the most of what we had and ended up having a really good time. I personally think it's more fun than dancing. Another example is when I was a freshman. One day seemed particularly difficult. I feel like no one wants to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting alone in the hall feeling like nobody cared. A senior from that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that frowning is harder than smiling. I realized he was absolutely right. Although smiling requires more muscle, frowning is less effective in the long run. If I could go back to that day, I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I trumpeted from something that wasn't even true. I always say something I regret later, but if I just "go with the flow" it doesn't seem that bad. If I could, I'd write a dozen songs that didn't have a sad or depressing meaning. Or millions of books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall, laugh rather than run away crying. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger like: breakups, heartache, @CAPS2.E classes, and of course laughter. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why don't you laugh as much as possible?
Many people have heard that laughter can make you live longer. I don't know if this is true, but I can believe it. When I laugh, I feel more relaxed and less stressed, @PERSON1 I can see the world differently. Sometimes this change is more pronounced in myself than in others, such as when I feel overworked, worn out, or sad before the miracle of laughter. I believe that making people laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @PERSON1 I am grateful that my days are filled with funny memories from good friend @PERSON1. One thing that must be present in any relationship is humor. You have to be able to make each other laugh. Me and my two best friends @PERSON1 have had so many times, we couldn't stop laughing. I cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know I will leave with a happy heart, a smile on my face, and a lot of good stories to tell. One of those occasions was @PERSON1's birthday party, one before @DATE1. @PERSON1 wanted a small party with only the people closest to her, so @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I was the only one invited. We live in a small but lovely town, however, not much to do when it comes to parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to @CAPS1, which is only half an hour away. It's a bubbly @DATE1 day @PERSON1 and we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON1 started her party by floating on the meandering @CAPS2 river. Just then, the laughter began. What's so funny about three twelve-year-old girls drifting alone down the river with a giant beach ball (an early birthday present) that soon became known as @CAPS3? One of the things that keeps our friendships so important is how we find humor in every situation when we're together. They think I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river grass, or pond weeds, or any type of water weeds), which is funny @PERSON1, every time someone bumps into me, I yell or yell Call. I think it's awesome that @PERSON1 can't get hold of her sandals, @PERSON1 will end up doing crazy dives for them as they float away. We all think the way @PERSON1, who is @CAPS4, doesn't want to get wet is ridiculous. @PERSON1, of course we pushed her countless times. These are what makes our relationship so special. We can take each other seriously when we need to, @PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friend @PERSON1, but when we are together I can let my guard down @PERSON1 can be who I am. My stupid, irrational, apparently hilarious self, @PERSON1, is still having fun. Our laughter can even change the way a situation develops. For example, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon of music @PERSON1 food after we were done on the river. We all have giant ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends have finished theirs, @PERSON1 playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. I was about to lick my waffle cone again and knock out all the ice cream in my cone when the @CAPS3 ball flew over @PERSON1! I was left with a complete cone, but all the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. If @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 didn't start laughing, who knows what would have happened. Maybe I'll cry, or be muffled for an hour or two. However, my face was so funny, staring at the empty tube in disbelief that they couldn't help but laugh. They fell hysterically on the grass. Even though I was disappointed, I started to break down, @PERSON1 and then everything seemed to be ok. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, in my case three people. Two of my best friends make me laugh like no one else I've ever met, @PERSON1 I doubt I'll ever meet anyone who makes me feel this way. This kind of laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax @PERSON1 and let our guard down, so the time after we laugh together is often the time when we talk to each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or the weather is bad, laughing is a surefire way to get them back on their feet @PERSON1 Smile. Even just being with them made me feel more energized and made me let go of my worries. That's why laughter is so important to the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It's the good times we have that help us the bad times, @PERSON1 I know our good times wouldn't be so good if it wasn't for the fact that we could laugh together.
@CAPS1 of Laughter Many believe that love brings people together. But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run. Before you fall in love with someone, though, you've already laughed with them. Laughter creates dialogue, repairs relationships, and brings joy to people. It's an important part of any relationship and certainly helped me make friends. In kindergarten, everything was new to me. I have to leave home, go to school, have lunch, and go to rest. There are a lot of kids like me, jumping up and down with excitement as our routine begins. Although we played together at school, there was no one to play with at home. One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around by my yard. I walked over and remembered him in my classroom that school day. "@CAPS2", that's what I said. He turned, and with all his might, hiccupped as loudly as he could. We fell into a burst of laughter, and I knew I made a new friend that day. Since then, he and I have become best friends. Any adventure that happens after school always ends with us laughing about something. There's no need for our parents to set up any "game dates" or schedule meetings with other kids because it's easier to laugh at things and make friends naturally, rather than embarrassing when parents chat. Since then, making friends has been a piece of cake. From elementary school to my teens, I had a best friend and more friends just because of the laughter in that moment. Laughter is something that always "breaks the ice". Whenever you meet new friends, it's always hard to talk to them. You don't know if it's serious, outgoing, funny or quiet. However, if something happens that makes you both laugh, it will be easier to communicate, because that laughter relieves some of the tension between the two. It's like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness, things get easier. For many people, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in everyone's life and sometimes it's hard to deal with. Whether it's a breakup, depression, or even the death of a loved one, the fun and laughter from @MONTH1 can help them get past the things that are bothering them. Most of their time is what a person wants to help them forget what was bothering them, even if it's just for a few minutes. This is how people build better relationships, and they do everything they can to make each other feel better. Aside from the healing and conversation-starting qualities, it's fun to laugh. @MONTH1 started with a small giggle, turned into a chuckle, and ended with 15 minutes of wild, side-scrambling laughter. Most of the time, you are with your friends, so they enjoy moments of joy and happiness with you. If you've never laughed once in your life, there's something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, ease painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Try it, it's not that hard. I promise it will bring you closer to someone, reduce stress in your life, and make you happy.
When I was younger, my sister and I would fight all the time. It's either verbal or physical. No matter what we're arguing about, we're going to be procrastinating for hours. Not only did we get more depressed over time, but my mom and family had had enough. It doesn't help that we only have @NUM1 months between us. It makes everything ten times tense. My mom has some strategies to try and get us to stop. One is to ground us. But we shared a room and that only made it worse. Another was doing us housework, which was both time-consuming and annoying, and the last was sitting us in a crisscross of applesauce, face-to-face, holding hands. We hate this. But every time we do, we end up breaking down and forgetting what we're even fighting for. After we do, we hug each other and move on. Laughter brings us closer and always helps us solve problems.
Life is so uncertain, unfair and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change the way people see the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concerns, in your darkest thoughts, laughter can bring sunshine. Laughter is good medicine for the sick, medicine for the wounded, and comfort for the elderly. We don't even have the thought of laughing, but laughter gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, the flashlight for the lost, and the lifeline for the desperate. Laughter is truly the medicine that heals all mankind. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breathe, we just breathe, it's part of life. It's natural for people to laugh, and it may not always be appropriate, but it's something we restore when necessary. Laughter makes dreams, hopes, and gives rest to uncertain thoughts. For many people, laughter is a friend, helper, and icebreaker, leaving joy and hope in everyone they meet. It's part of life and we have to cherish every moment. Laughter helped me many times, but one stood out more than others. For a moment, a simple moment, the laughter changed me, changed my perspective, changed life itself; made my life come alive. I dropped my shoulders and listened to my sixth-term teacher as she babbled about unimportant things. I turned around, hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned around, I met someone I had never spoken to, who looked at me curiously, waiting for my explanation. I thought, no, I need to talk to him, so I jumped at the chance. "@CAPS1 Have you ever watched wrestling?" He smiled. It would be completely different without that conversation @CAPS1. He could @CAPS1 ignore me but he laughed and it changed the trajectory of my life. It wasn't long before the man became my boyfriend because we started chatting after I asked him. That laughter made everything so easy, it kept the puzzle in place. The moment for @CAPS1 came when laughter dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughter is a wonderful thing, you still need to be careful about when to laugh and when not to. What struck me again was when I was young. I played alone most of the time, picked up a Barbie, I brushed her hair, "@CAPS2 come here." Hearing my dad's call, I went to the living room where my brother already lived, with my Barbie wait. My dad got down on his knees and said, "@CAPS3 will be leaving soon because she needs some time. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is ok. I want you to be with her, I'll be there when I'm free See you. I love you @CAPS2 always remember this." I laughed, I didn't realize or even understand what was going on. I laughed when we got in the car and when we left I realized how serious the problem was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but I didn't take it seriously and it hurt me. Life never knows, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or abandon us. Laughter is an emotion that heals wounds, but it is also a force that we cannot abuse or abuse. Gives us joy and fun, it helps cheer us up and makes us happy when we fall. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of mankind.
laughter? What is laughter? Well, laughter is a contagious disease, spread by a group of people from one person to another, (says @CAPS1) and should be included in everyone's life as they grow up. This is a true story of how laughter played a key role in my life as a child. My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter, and as I said, we celebrate all year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, @DATE1 for @DATE1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. On my birthday, the entire @CAPS5 gathered at my grandparents' house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a few days before my birthday, my mom authorizes me to invite some of my friends over to see some events or go to the arcade. Then when we get home, we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies. When @LOCATION2 finally decided to greet us with colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 met at my uncle's house to hide the eggs for our kids to find. We always seem to miss at least one every year. As we hunt for eggs, our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the backyard to put the eggs back where we found them. Then watch him try to climb down again. When this was all over, we played a game of hide and seek. It's a little hard to win when there are fourteen people hiding on an acre. At @DATE1, everyone has their own leisure agenda. My dad and I go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 lights up @CAPS6 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 on day 3 of @DATE1. While waiting for the show to start, we played a game of laser tag that ended up being a massive game of around 50 or so people. Then on @DATE1 my dad did his own show in the backyard for our kids and it was really exciting. And then my favorite laughing day @CAPS2. My dad made his house a haunted house. It's funny because we all get painters and get shot at stupid ropes thrown at us from unseen sources. When we go trick-or-treating, I'm usually a soldier with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for a fun night even when I'm right next to them , they can't find me either. Then we got home and the contest was to see who got the most candy, and I usually won because I stayed out later than my siblings. Well, now is the holiday @CAPS3 that ends all other holidays! Time to give and receive gifts. Mainly for me to receive. We all have a dish that ends up being part of when I cook, or anyone who dares to go into the kitchen. After everyone had eaten, we sat down and started opening presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then, until you're an adult, you can give your own gift for free, but let's get it in order again. It was fun watching my cousin as they chased my cousin around the house as he took presents from them. This is my story about a year of laughter for me in a nutshell. That's why laughter should be in everyone's life as they grow up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like what my grandparents used to say to our kids when we were sad: "Laughing for a day will keep @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1".
An interesting story Many years ago, @CAPS1's best friend @PERSON1 and I spent the night at @CAPS1's house. We are all excited because @CAPS1 dad will be the only one there. @CAPS1 Mom and brother are late. After eating popcorn and candy, we decided to try something new and fun. @CAPS1 house has a counter bar that can seat four or five people, so @CAPS1 dad decided to turn on some hip hop. As if @PERSON1 and I could read each other's minds, we hopped on the counter and started running in running mode. Our work is different. It's funny to see @CAPS1 dad pretend to be a fake photographer and say it's "gorgeous" like he's a real photographer. @PERSON1 and I swaggered around, posing and turning around until we were dizzy. We all know we'll never be able to do this with @CAPS1 mom @ORGANIZATION1 which makes it so much fun! We were all gasping for laughter! Later after that fun model run, we decided to pillow surf down the stairs. I was a little scared at first, but when I saw @PERSON1's expression, I knew I had to. I grabbed a big pillow and rushed down the stairs like a champ! It's amazing! @PERSON1 and I've been using pillow @CAPS2 for seemingly forever! @CAPS1 Dad put on @ORGANIZATION1 and we laughed all night. That night was one of the best memories of @CAPS1's childhood and @ORGANIZATION1.
In my opinion, I think laughter is a very important part of life. What would the world be like without laughter and jokes? It will be a very boring and dull place. I can't even imagine what it would look like. The world needs laughter. People need jokes, they need laughter and comedy in their lives. I myself have a lot of laughter in my life. One day in fifth grade, my best friend and I were jogging down the track for gym class. We ran together, talked to each other and told jokes to help pass the time because it was really boring. I told a really good joke, I don't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We both laughed and cried together. He fell on the track and rolled onto the grass. I said "@CAPS1 we need to move on or the PE teacher will be pissed". He said, "I can't, I just peeed my pants!" which made me laugh even harder. He got up and walked towards the gym teacher. The PE teacher asked my friend to go to the nurse's office. I met him in the classroom after gym class and he told me he called his mom and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. I wonder what his mother must have been thinking. It's been a fun day. We've been talking about that day together ever since. I always make fun of him peeing his pants, but I told him a funny joke. Our entire relationship was built on making each other laugh and tell jokes. Just when the two of us were stupid together, this is what we did. Jokes and laughter made our friendship even better and gave me fond memories that I might have for the rest of my life. At the same time, without jokes and laughter in your friendship, it can make your relationship very boring and lame. If you don't have any laughter in your friendship , or very little laughter, then you're not going to be with that person, which makes you not want to be with them because it just feels boring. I have another friend named @CAPS2 and I go to his house occasionally and we hang out and play video games together. Strangely, we barely even communicated with each other. We just do things without any fun. No jokes or laughter or anything like that. We just play his video games in silence, without saying a word to each other. This is the saddest thing I've ever seen. This is the most boring friendship two people can have. It's really boring there because we just do the same things over and over. I really don't really like going there. I'd rather have fun at different friends' houses, but I go there anyway and I don't know why. The absence of jokes and laughter in friendship just makes things boring and not interesting. This is something you absolutely need. Laughter is an important element not only in friendships, but also in dating relationships. If you're dating someone, then you absolutely need to keep laughing in your relationship. If you look around you will always see couples joking together, laughing at each other all the time and having a good time. This makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Come to think of it, who wants to date a boring guy who doesn't like to laugh or joke? Nobody wants to. So you need laughter and comedy more in a dating relationship than in a friendship. You want things to run smoothly so that people like you and find you interesting. This is one of the key factors that make couples close. As you can see from my three examples, laughter does make a big difference in relationships and life in general. If you laugh in friendship, it can really affect your relationship very well. It makes it a fun and interesting relationship. Laughter makes people happy and get along with each other. If you're feeling down, laughter will always lift you up and make you feel better. It's almost like a medicine. If you don't have a laugh, it can really make things go bad and make relationships boring. Nobody wants that. People don't want a boring, lifeless relationship with someone. Laughter is a great way to bring people together. It brings all my friends together and makes us better friends. We had a great time and really enjoyed it. Laughter is a beautiful thing that everyone needs to have in their lives.
From laughter to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 On the first day of school last year, I walked through the gates hoping to make a friend or two. I'm not sure how this will happen, but I hope for the best. I entered my first class, sitting at a table full of unfamiliar faces. I wanted to say something, but was afraid of their reaction. The teacher made us play a few games and we had to introduce ourselves. Those don't really help. Everyone was nervous and everything was awkward. I @CAPS3 want to be myself and make friends. For the rest of the time, all of my classes are like this. Everyone was nervous and awkward, as if something was keeping us quiet. Not knowing anyone doesn't help the situation. That was my first day. The next day, I walked through the gates of the school, determined to make some friends. I thought about what jokes I could tell, what funny things I could share about myself, but all of that sounded like silly ideas to me. I walked into the humanities and sat at a table with a friendly-looking girl. The teacher told us to introduce ourselves to the other students at our table. It was pretty quiet for about a minute or so, but I'd love to introduce myself. I can't stand this silence any longer. I took a pencil out of my backpack and I saw a note from my mom that said "@CAPS4 Be yourself, make some friends, honey, and have a great day at school. :)". I started laughing because I thought it was funny my mom wrote me a note and stuffed it in my backpack. It was so unexpected, I felt like a kid. I started laughing, and when I looked up, the girl next to me was laughing too. I knew what I had to say, so I did. I said, "@CAPS5 My name is @PERSON1, but you can call me @CAPS4 for short. What's your name?". The girl looked at me, smiled and said, "@CAPS5, my name is @CAPS8". Then I asked her which middle school she was from and other questions. We stared and talked, we exchanged numbers, we became good friends. From laughter to @CAPS1, who knows? A year later, we are still friends. We always laughed at how we started talking. A few days ago, I told her how I was feeling on the second day of school @CAPS2. I told her I was afraid to introduce myself. She said she felt the same way and she didn't know what to do. I've since thanked my mom for that note because without it I wouldn't have laughed or made @CAPS8 laugh and I wouldn't have made such great friends.
It's your first day of high school, and your gut is full of butterflies that make you want to run to the bathroom to hide from the world. I also have friends from @CAPS7 and I'm shy to go to any group so I walk to all my classes by myself. Students would ask me in person which school I came from and want to know everything about me. I remember wanting to be alone and hide in my own bubble space. Girls will ask @CAPS5 and I'm frustrated because I'm not smiling and having no fun learning about my new class. Lunch is much more crowded than my previous school. Students would sit in the hallway for lunch, or chat loudly around a large table. I bit my lip looking for a place not occupied by students. I found an empty table in the front of the lunch room, put my brown lunch bag in front of me, and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and settled down beside me, laughing at each other for not sitting next to me. "@CAPS1 I'm @PERSON3, what's your name?" was my response from a skinny boy in a black hat. "@PERSON1" is my reply to everyone who has been staring at me. "The name is beautiful, I'm @LOCATION1, this is @LOCATION2, you just met @PERSON3, @PERSON4 is that funny kid next to you with his orange backpack," I smiled and nodded to them as @ORGANIZATION2 wore @CAPS2 @CAPS3 T-shirt, @PERSON2 in military uniform with @CAPS4 on it. They all had lunch at school and had pizza or sandwiches. They showed everyone, including me, photos of interesting events on their phones. "@CAPS5 That kid could get a shaving rash if he's not careful." I smiled at a photo of a little boy sliding down a slide that looked like a cheese grader. @PERSON3 took all his pepperoni and haphazardly tossed it in the air. @PERSON2 is going to take a picture of everyone on her phone to get a picture ID. @PERSON4 was the next photo of @LOCATION3 as the pepperoni slipped off and landed on @ORGANIZATION1's face. I laughed and everyone at the table joined in. @PERSON3 and I hold our stomachs together to dry our tears. @PERSON4 went to the bathroom to wash the smell off his face and when he came back @PERSON2 said, "@CAPS6 my word you should see your face I took your pic right after the pepperoni hit your face, Your pics are hilarious, your mouth is open like you're about to eat, like you're mad." @PERSON2 handed her phone to one person at a time, and we started laughing again, asking @PERSON2 to post the photo sent to each of them. "I wonder @CAPS5 can I be your friend?" I asked looking them in the eyes. @ORGANIZATION2 was the only one who responded, "@CAPS7 you can't be our friend, @PERSON1 duh @CAPS5 we don't want to be your friend, then we don't hang out with you." @ORGANIZATION2 teased. My twisted intestines loosen with the re-leaf. "@CAPS8 We might find an excuse to leave," @PERSON3 laughed. When pepperoni sticks to @LOCATION4's face, I laugh at myself for worrying about not fitting in, or having friends who can make me laugh so hard.
Laughter can sometimes be something that we all share, and sometimes it's only used by a few people because it's directed at each other. But hopefully it's something we can all share most of the time. Laughter opens a relationship in which people can feel more comfortable. Some people may be complete strangers to each other, and then just a simple joke and laughter can make them seem like friends for years. Now, laughter isn't the only way to help people get acquainted with each other, they can share similar likes or dislikes, but most of the time laughter is something everyone needs in a relationship. I remember when I first met my friend @PERSON1 he was not outgoing, but by joking he seemed more willing to talk to others. He and I talk a lot about @CAPS1 our daily life has a lot to deal with but instead of joking we decided to laugh at @CAPS1 we are complaining when our lives are easier than others. Some people have to work @NUM1 jobs to support their families, we're here complaining @CAPS1 we have to wake up and go to school, we laugh at @CAPS1 we sound pathetic . A few days later, we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do after high school when we grew up. @PERSON1 said he wanted to be a taekwondo coach, he already had a small job, I said "@CAPS1 did you get the job?", he replied, "When my coach was around, I Kicked a child hard in the face. Watch". We both had a good laugh and we became more friends because of that laughter, because it is only through laughter that we become civilized.
Laughter @CAPS1 is one of the most important things in life. People shouldn't spend a day without @CAPS1. Be healthy and well in any relationship. It can also help heal. The best laughter is when you're out of breath and crying. It makes people so happy and want more. Don't take life too seriously, just keep laughing and smiling. Dying alone is a terrible thing. It was even worse when two high school students died. At @DATE1 @TIME1 a group of high school students were walking on rocks by the sea when a sneaker wave swept two of them. The other children tried very hard to rescue them with a rope on their clothes, but it didn't work. On that day, two beautiful lives were taken away and will not be forgotten. The boys are popular and have a good life. The student's family, school, friends and community are in shock and cannot believe the terrible news. How could such a powerful person encounter such a thing. Hundreds of students gathered in church the following @DATE2, most in tears. They talked about the two boys and had a huge group prayer. Friends say they are good, miss them so much, talk about good, fun, unforgettable times. @CAPS1 can make it even better. As someone once said, smile because they're alive, don't cry because they're gone. At the school basketball game, they paid tribute to the boys and won the game for them. Parents and friends spoke to almost @NUM1 about the beautiful kids who came to support the school. This game is a time to enjoy good times instead of crying and blues. This game helped heal the community a little more. @CAPS1 and cheers really help the heart. People still get heartbreak as the days, weeks and months go by. Although, as long as we smile and laugh at the good times of those who left, we can do it. @CAPS1 makes you feel better. It just shows you that you have to make the most of what you have and always have a good time with no regrets. Always tell those who mean something to you that you love them. Never stop telling people you love them and never leave in a fight. You don't know when it might be the last time you see them. @CAPS1 is very important, life wouldn't be so good without it.
People can share a lot. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter has made our relationship stronger than ever. When I was younger it was a typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, and frankly we didn't like each other at all. By maturing, getting into high school, being part of the same cheerleading team, we spent almost too much time together, and now we're almost like best friends. On @DATE3, we have been together. We'd watch Jerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of those who volunteered for the show. We'll be watching a clip of showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1 where I introduced her to the character "@CAPS2". @PERSON3 and I will talk to each other with our voice adapted from "@CAPS2" and keep laughing at @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted "The Devil's Voice". We would use these voices to talk to each other, and our friends. We both still talk like @DATE1. When we entered high school, we had to start driving to and from school together every day. We would listen to music, randomly choreograph steps, and sometimes if her favorite song came out, I had to direct (she's a very dynamic dancer). Still, it's all fun. Everything changes when we enter school, and I get it after about a week. I'm the nasty little sister who can't say hello to her in the hall, can't wave to her when she's around her friends. She wants to be alone so she doesn't look weird. She was a junior at the time and they always thought they were the coolest around. By senior year, she would greet me, smile when she saw me, and sometimes I would even chat with her and her friends. We also grew closer when I got into her student leadership class, we were in the same class every other day and it was hard not to talk to each other. I believe one of the things that made our relationship stronger because of the laughter was that she was in my room for three weeks. She decided to "move in" and when she woke up in the morning with bugs on her arms and legs, she didn't know where they came from. We suspect she just doesn't remember getting them when @TIME1 was out before, but she still gets them when she's not. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I slept on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two or three nights so my parents would have time to sanitize her room. This became two or three weeks. We were together almost every hour of the day for the three weeks and the only peace I got was the shower. We would stay up all night talking about our day, who we didn't like, whose outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheerleading practice and who could be better at cheerleading. If you know @PERSON3, you know how terrified she is of a movie, so half the time when we were running late, I was by her side trying to scare her. It's interesting to watch her reaction. In the end she "moved out" and I got the room back, although I don't think, even now it feels the same as before. They say a lot about laughter; "Laughter is the best medicine" "Laughter is the shortest distance between people" "@CAPS5 two people in a room and they will laugh in @NUM2 minutes"; all These are talking about how relationships develop with laughter. I have the funniest, dumbest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. People say we think the same, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, we wear a lot of the same things. My positive laughter strengthened my sister's relationship with me. I bet if you actually look at the relationship between you and the people you are close to, the first memory that comes to your mind is the happy moment you laugh.
The other day I asked my friend @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 the house for her @NUM1 birthday party. I know a birthday party is going to be a lot of fun, even if it's just going to be @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 and me. I didn't know it was going to be interesting as it turned out to be though. The whole day I was waiting for it to be @NUM2 so I could go to her house. I packed all my bags and got everything ready because it was a sleepless night. As I was the one on my way to her, she called me and said, "You come to my house and look right now." My dad and I drove to her house the whole way I've been riding on the right side of my eyes I'm not going to quit knowing what I've been looking for, though. As we approached I saw something in the grass. Here are @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON2. I pressed them with my dad so they knew I was there and they all pulled down their pants and exposed us like he did! I laughed so hard all night I was thinking about the look on my dad's face! I have no idea if it was the funniest thing that happened that night. Later @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2 and I went for a walk to the Dock House by @LOCATION1. While we were flying bats on the pier and @waterperson2 almost fell because she was scared. @ORGANIZATION1 and I stand behind her laughing so hard! It was getting dark and her neighbors were very loud. So we ran from the dock to her neighbor's house and HID and started yelling at their stuff and it went quiet! It's so funny because they don't know where the shouting is coming from so they just keep looking around confused. We started laughing so hard we could barely keep quiet. We had to wait a while for her neighbors to stop looking around trying to find out who told them to be quiet. That's not to say whatever the funniest thing happens! As we were walking back to the @LOCATION1 house, we heard a car coming, so we made a plan, I was standing in the middle of the road, and @ORGANIZATION1 was in front of me, while @PERSON2 was hiding in the bushes. The plan is for @ORGANIZATION1 and I'm going to pretend to be in a fight, and @PERSON2 is going to run out into the bushes and pretend to shoot me. So start a fake fight with me, @ORGANIZATION1 when the car starts to turn. As the car gets closer it starts to slow down, come here @PERSON2 bushes and @CAPS2 running out! Pretend to fake me. I fell to the ground like I was really hurt trying to hold back my laughter, and the man we thought we got in the car, good man. Then, we knew there was no way, when she actually shot me, there was no sound of a gun firing at all! So the people in the carriage came up close and they were laughing so hard we could even hear who it was before we could hear them. As they approached, we realized it was just some @ORGANIZATION1 family friends coming over to party so they knew it was fake the whole time. When it got deeper outside, we found a giant watermelon and took it out using @LOCATION1's house bridge. We brought her the camera and put it on the night vision sprinkled watermelon. When it hits the water it goes crazy with a very loud noise and splits into a bunch of small pieces! That night was one of the best and funniest I've ever had. The next day, all the fun continues by entering the lake and swinging the rope swing into the water. @ORGANIZATION1 got a really bad rope burn and it was hilarious! @PERSON2, @ORGANIZATION1 I always laugh the best time together, and tons. A lot more happened that night and it was overall @ORGANIZATION1 great @NUM1 birthday. I'm so glad I got there with her.
We've all had times when something happens and you just treat it as a hassle. But looking behind the same event you just have to laugh at how stupid it is. I recall one of these experiences when I was on a motorcycle camping trip like this @DATE1. It was a sunny day and my dad dropped me off at the start of the main logging road in the area. I decided to continue on my slow and steady pace and just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later in the day, I found a picturesque spot to camp on the river for a few nights. At @TIME1, I remembered some spurs from the main road, from when I was driving in these woods with my brother, and decided to explore some of them near my camp. I decided to take a look at a river crossing and it looked like an interesting journey. As I was over it hit some lost rocks on my front tire and made me fall into the water! Thankfully, I was groggy from my motorcycle, and if I had it out of my own woods it would probably have been on me, it would have put me in quite a predicament. After getting my @ORGANIZATION1 out of the water I went back to camp to dry my clothes and see how I only brought a group of me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry, I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up, I realized that the sun had been up for a while, so I decided that I'd better go before another ride for the day. This time I stayed on my water side and went down a steep road that led to the top of the ridge. As I climbed it got warmer and then I burst through the woods to witness the splendid sight. The ridge of the sun just peaked in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun. After a while just sitting I got to go again. I taper into a valley on the road to start. At its bottom, the flood washed a lot of sediment over the road, and it was still muddy. When I crossed it my wheels started spinning out at me and I ended up throwing in very dirty mud. I rushed back to camp again to wash my clothes in the river. This time, I didn't fall asleep for quite a while, and when I did it was a fit for an all-one.Upon waking up I packed up my meager supplies and came out to finish my journey. Most days leave me on the way to my destination, so I'm forced to stop and rest overnight. Just set up my tent and got some food at @TIME1 for dinner and breakfast didn't take me long. At one point I was occupying my time and I was just sitting by my fire and thinking about my travels and life in general. When I fell asleep, I slept soundly until @TIME1. Waking up to the sound of birdsong and river rushing by me is delightful and energizing. It only took me a few hours to get there my dad was going to meet me and take me home.This trip helped me think and get my ideas. It also helps me to enjoy the little things in life that we take for granted so often. Watching it behind always makes me laugh and realize that my mistakes could have been worse, but they turned out to be only minor frustrations. All in all, this is a great time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul.
Laughing is a natural response when they are not happy or have heard or seen something that is funny they all have. It's healthier than sad or crazy happy etc. Laughing is a sign of great happiness, as crying is sadness. It's just another natural outpouring of emotion that anyone is born with. The laughter once said is the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in their lives where they are happy together I agree with the quote people. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as they don't take everything personally and can appreciate a sense of jokes. It's always a good sense of humor because it's appreciated by everyone, and at the same time, people can see that you enjoy having fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When you're with a group of friends and you get along well, one of the main things you'll hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and have a good time with you. Of course, there are times when it's better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, it's often annoying. Laughing means you're happy, but it doesn't need to be used when noise is aroused, and it's better to keep silent than to annoy those around you. In my group of friends, we are always giggling around each other and I like when people have a good sense of humor, and I find it easier and more convenient to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything serious. Even if it's natural, you need to know when you can and can't laugh. It's a way to show happiness, but in some cases it can be disrespectful or rude. Sometimes when me and my friends they @MONTH1 joke about someone, once that happens, at my friend's birthday party, we all go to the bowling alley and as usual, all stand around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, @Person3 might be with @PERSON4 so everyone started listening to the jokes in their conversation. They were joking about something, and then @Person3 probably said something to reject him in a certain way, making a joke that @PERSON4 said going to HES to get his heart broken. That said, right after that, @ORGANIZATION1 hits and joins. So it turned out to sound like @PERSON4 was about to have his heart broken again. Everyone laughed at it, @PERSON4 watched @ORGANIZATION1 have hurt expressions and was the only one not laughing. You see, @PERSON4 has a girlfriend and broke up with him about two months ago, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about that and didn't when she added "again" what it means. She meant it as a joke, but it originally sounded average. In this case, the laughter by @ORGANIZATION1 is hurting for those @PERSON4, who are @ORGANIZATION1's comments. Good stuff @ORGANIZATION1 for noticing and remembering the day before and after @PERSON4. She ended up apologizing for saying what she should have thought by saying more carefully. How does one take it when people laugh at them, there's a lot to do with friendship. Once, my friends were driving to a party, or a party home and the people in the car were listening to music, and one of the players in the car was singing a song he heard through @PERSON1. Once, when he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone was hearing that @PERSON2 was singing very loud, with no music in the car. Everyone started laughing because @PERSON2 didn't know @CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. As awkward as it was, @PERSON2 laughed along because it was so much fun. If @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 hadn't been such good friends, I'd be sure @PERSON2 would have gotten crazy about @CAPS1 doing something like this when he did, and there are just two of them there to leave someone else in the car. Friends understand everyone's sense of humor, know when something is going to go away, or when other people will find it funny, and will laugh along too. So you see, laughter can be happy, grateful, annoying, or mean, you just need to know it's good to do, and when it's better not to laugh. Although this is a natural response, it is one that can be controlled and thought through before doing so. The next time someone says something funny, think about it first, if it can laugh at the person being insulted before it hurts someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and live happily.
One day, I decided to go to my friend @PERSON1's house. When I went there we cleaned the pool and I ran away from her dad because he had booger on his fingers chasing me. This is one of the days when I laugh more with @PERSON1! We start the day just laying on top of her and watching a movie on her little @CAPS1. I don't really remember what the movie was, but it didn't matter because we were too busy talking about completely random things. After the movie we went to the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob because @PERSON1 has no cable in his room. At the time, my knee was injured, so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I let myself sit on the couch with @PERSON1 sitting next to me. About @NUM1 minutes later, her dad came in with booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me boogers, he put it on your lips, and I got up and tried to run away. I know if I don't run away, he'll literally put my lips on mine because he's done it before. It really hurts to put so much pressure on my knee, so I want to use one leg as quickly as possible. I'm hiding in @PERSON1's closet and all I can hear is @PERSON1's laughter and her father's footsteps. I waited @NUM2 minutes in her closet and came out because I could tell the coast was clean. I'm back in the living room with @PERSON1 and I'm laughing at the whole thing. After we stopped laughing, we decided to go outside to clean the pool. We were in the mood to go swimming and the pool was out all winter so it was really bad there. There were telephone poles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites, and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish there. We went in and started scooping out all the water with the bucket. We didn't notice these little pillars until then. We don't want to throw them in the yard with the rest of the water, because we know it'll dry up and die there. So every time we scoop a bucket of water, we take it all out and put it in a little jar for hours. Afterwards, we went into the house looking for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find it, so we went and bought shampoo. We poured the shampoo on the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. It took too long and wasn't very fun, so we came up with the brilliant idea of slathering the shampoo on our clothes and swiping around. I skated a dozen times and so did she. It's hard for us to stand firm. We laughed so hard I almost pissed myself but I couldn't get in because I was soaking wet and I was covered in soap. After the pool was clean and tidy, we had to scoop out all the soap and water again. All this took about @NUM4 hours, but it did and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom came home from get off work glad we cleaned it up because it meant she didn't have to. I said goodbye to @PERSON1 after Grandpa came to pick me up. I came home thinking that it was one of the funniest days of my life. Overall, I think I laughed more than ever on this day.
@CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 You used to feel like there wasn't enough time in the day to do everything you wanted to do. @CAPS7 That's how I feel every day, @CAPS4 @CAPS2 I feel like it's tiring and screwed up, it all started when I got @CAPS4's job at @ORGANIZATION1. Since I got the job, I've never gone to school at @CAPS3, @CAPS5, and can barely take a break. @CAPS4 grades @CAPS3 keep dropping little. @CAPS10 always tired to fall asleep in class or just too lazy to do @CAPS4 work, I will drop @CAPS4 hours but I need as much money as possible to help @CAPS4 mom Do my best. @CAPS4 Mom didn't really do much with her @CAPS2 so now she really has nothing to fall back on. So I feel like I @CAPS3 will do whatever I can to help her and @CAPS4 brother @CAPS3 will accept that responsibility but he got his girlfriend pragnet and moved out at a young age to live in his own @CAPS2. So I'm the second child and I feel like @CAPS4 has a duty to take care of @CAPS4 mo m. I love @CAPS4 mom so much, she's always there @CAPS4 @CAPS2, unlike @CAPS4 dad...so I do everything I can to make sure she stays rich. Because when she's gone @CAPS10 not sure what I'd do without her. @CAPS4 little brother has a pain in his back in @CAPS4 and he never does anything to help around the house or help @CAPS4 mom when she's feeding her family or anything like that, so I think @CAPS10 will go to @CAPS3 to set up his streath . I know mom won't like it but "All @CAPS7" he needs to stop being so lazy and help our mom more. Now back to me @CAPS10 I think a good kid anyway, @CAPS7 @CAPS10 a trubel maker won't get me wrong, but if I do the right thing I might be a safe kid. I sometimes try to be that kid, but it's just too boring, I can't, because when I try, I feel like @CAPS10 is trying to be a different person, @CAPS9 not me @CAPS10 a loud and funky kid, Is the class clown in the classroom. Just like people always ask me if @CAPS3 has any plans for galleage, I'll just say I don't think @CAPS10 calleage is smart and I'll be lucky if I graduate. @CAPS10 trying to get @CAPS4 grades back up, but @CAPS9 hard you @CAPS3 has a lot of other things to do, like @CAPS4 work, now seeing winter approaching spring, that means work will get busier, I'm going to @CAPS3 to work more. Honestly @CAPS10 Not sure if or how @CAPS10 does all this. With all these responsibilities, I'm going to be a tired teenage boy, @CAPS10 pertty If I really try @CAPS4 I can definitely handle it. All I know is that I need to find a better job with less stress, more tiring and fewer days, but with better money. Like being in some quick lube of anything is better than working in a fast food restaurant.
I think laughter is important. This is very important to me because let's say a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think it's funny and it hurts that student. I think instead of laughing at someone, it's better to be a good kid, ask him if he's ok and help him. This shows that the student does have a friend who really cares about him and doesn't laugh at him and really cares about his best friend. You can also be rewarded for doing good, but for me it's really not what I get, it's what I do to help my peers. I think we should not laugh, have a positive attitude, be mature about what we do and what we say, and react to things like laughing at others. I also thought that if I fell and I was really hurt and the kids would start laughing at me, that's how I learned to respect students the way you want to be respected. So I don't want people to make fun of me, if I don't want people to make fun of me, why should I make fun of others, that's why you should respect your peers.
One day I was with my friend @PERSON1. We have been friends for a long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog taco ran away and I had an argument with my parents. @CAPS4 asked if I wanted to go out for a walk and I said I would. We're very good friends in this regard, @CAPS4 always knows when something goes wrong, although I think I'm hiding @CAPS1 well. As we got up, we walked past kids playing in the park with their parents, and a man fetching with his dog, @CAPS1 it was sunny and warm. @CAPS1 is in summer. We stood on the bridge for a minute before @CAPS4 asked me "what's the matter, @CAPS2?" @CAPS3 @CAPS1 told him what happened, I told him my dog ran away and my parents were mad at me. I told him I was sad. I don't know why I opened up to him like this, we almost never talk about the drama of our lives. We are always laughing and joking. I thought @CAPS4 liked me, I actually hope @CAPS4 likes me. I liked him for a while. We started talking about everything going on in our lives, school, friends, parents, etc. @CAPS4 puts me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at a picnic table. We sat across from each other and sat there chatting for a while. Then @CAPS1 started running late and I had to go home. I said "Thank you for making me happy, I really needed a laugh and a smile today." @CAPS4 looked at me, held my hand and said, "@CAPS5 should always smile because @CAPS5 never knows who's going to fall in love Your smile." And @CAPS4 kissed me. It was a day I will remember for a long time. I'm still with @PERSON1, we've been together for almost @NUM1 months.
When the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case extreme weather @CAPS1. I live in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at this time and eight years old. This happened in the middle of @DATE1, @CAPS3 with almost record heat @LOCATION2. This day, at 125 degrees @ CAPS4 has peaked, and to make matters worse, our entire block is out of power. No one has air conditioning, and many people end up getting seriously ill or injured. We live in a gated community and get along very well with everyone. People from this area gathered together and pitched tents for shade and provided everyone with cold water. Also the important thing you have to remember @CAPS3 a situation like this happens, you have to have a good mindset because it's no help complaining nor thinking about who needs it @CAPS1 and helping other people . I don't think our society will last if it's everyone's huge attitude and spirit without, of course, laughter. It is so important to have such a situation in a good state of mind. What's the point of complaining, pissing off, without any reason? I was told it wouldn't last forever and made my jaw drop. I can tell you that many other kids, who complain and even adults have a harder time coping with this situation. It was very uncomfortable, no complaints, as an eight year old, but I ended up managing with the help of lots of water. If you put your spirits up and interact with people, the words seem to go through much faster. I remember @CAPS3 in one of my family's tents, doing nothing but telling funny stories, and telling jokes. I would prefer to live a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. Just don't think about it @CAPS1 out of the fact that you've probably done a lot of important things. If you don't think about it, then you'll have a better time than being complained about. It keeps your mind off the topic so you don't stress out very important in many situations. I see a lot of people who just can't take it there. They'll just say, how bad it is, it's easy to tell, they're all stressed out. If you try to make the situation good, instead of thinking about it, then you will get through it, no matter how bad it is. In moving @CAPS1 this @CAPS2, many people need help. The community was a big help as they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad, people were tired and suffering from @CAPS1 and many had to wear @CAPS5. Several ambulances were there to help out and get them back to normal. Some people do need to go to the hospital and get further attention. The community finally passed the day, so badly hurt. The power came back at about six o'clock. Depleted people walk or drive slowly back to their houses. Our whole family walked back into the house and immediately turned on the air conditioner. Everyone was so relieved and happy that we finally got out of this situation. Even at night, daytime is at a low frequency of 112 degrees. The nights off we play games, tell jokes, and get through it all. Our family has stayed strong through @CAPS1 and many haven't. It just says, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
Laughter is one of the great joys in my life. Life would be boring if people never laughed, most of my favorite experiences involve @CAPS9 while having a good time. One of my best laughter experiences was camping with my friends last @DATE2. I will never forget my last @DATE2 experience. In the middle of @DATE2, on a sunny @DATE1 @TIME1 my @CAPS4 @CAPS1 called me, @CAPS2 I was sending a group to camp and I should come. I immediately @CAPS3 my parents let me go, with the only exception of submitting my job application to @ORGANIZATION1 before I go camping. After submitting the application, I got in the car, picked up my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 and the ingredients for the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and set off on an adventure. After I drove @NUM1 miles down the river to my destination, I didn't see anyone but two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be. Watching @CAPS5, camp being attacked by bears, litter all around, camp fire still burning, I started looking for my friends. I found @CAPS1 passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him up but he fell asleep. @PERSON3 and I didn't know what to do, so we sat in the shade of the big trees around and the @NUM2 degrees outside were fine. After about five minutes, we burst out laughing and went to investigate. We walked towards the river and found all our friends jumping off of @NUM3ft rocks and we went to play. After about @NUM4 jumps each time, we returned to camp. @CAPS1 woke up, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS7, @PERSON3 and myself all huddled around the campfire @CAPS8 We got back to camp and joked all night. All of us really combined this three day camping trip @CAPS9, kidding, just be boy. I won't get rid of those memories for anything. After camping, I got home and worked a lot for the rest of @DATE2, but since then I have developed really good friendships with all of my camping mates.
Once upon a time, @DATE1, I had a birthday party and my friends came over. My friend tree brought his projector and hung his @CAPS1 on it. We played @CAPS2: @CAPS3 on his projector and my @CAPS4.V. With my @CAPS1. Then we got bored and all of us walked into the living room with the girls, calmed down, and hung out for a while, then we ate cake, had a icing, played games, and had a good laugh. Then we went to the park next to our apartment. We play @CAPS6, joke and laugh more. Then we went back to my place and we looked at @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @NUM1 and laughed at the screaming people. Then we played Spin the Bottle/Truth or Dare and we laughed a lot.
The only true story I can recall involving laughter was at the beach about @NUM1 years ago. I'm with my mom and sister @LOCATION1. When I decided to just hit one wave, I was running from the oncoming wave that swept me off my feet and gave me a spin that seemed to take forever, but not even @NUM2 seconds. I laughed so hard I tripped and I started spinning again and my mom had to pick me up because I couldn't stop. It's hilarious that I cut so many knives out of the sand. After changing clothes, I got a big boob that my dad could fit in. That was the only time I remember laughter being my true friend.
My @CAPS1 year high school started out less favorable than most. By the end of my eighth grade, I found out that my friends weren't as loyal as I thought they were when our friendship started and in turn no one started high school. It's not all bad because I was able to see things about myself for the first time in my life. Of course I was sulking, but looking back now, I'm grateful for the time it helped me understand myself better. However, one cannot live a life without friends, so I quickly try to abide by what is considered "normal". I've been lucky from the start, but I'm still left out by all the people I once considered friends and in turn see these recipients as acquaintances. Like most acquaintances, we only spoke in class, and the conversation was casual, just trivial facts. I want to have "real" friends, but I'm not sure what a real friend is. I think these so-called acquaintances consider me a friend, although I can never be sure if that is the case. So I continued to talk to one person in every class, but there was no one to sit with at lunch. However, this situation became more desirable because my sister was still in high school at this time. Her presence made my life a little easier because I could confide in her and even have lunch with her. People who have friends @MONTH1 all the time don't get it, but it can be a little lonely when you have nowhere to sit at lunch. Luckily, my sister was always there for me, although she did skip school a lot. As long as she's not around, I can rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my friends, I could always share my sisters. This nomadic life continued into the second trimester of my @CAPS1 year. I know the class and it feels like it's a fresh start and anything can happen and anything I can imagine has happened. It starts the same as the previous three months. I took my first few classes, made more acquaintances as usual, and felt like things weren't going to change after all. However, after sitting alone for five minutes in my costume-making class, two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and stuck with it. I know it's wrong to listen to other people's conversations, but I think if they don't want me to hear them, they'll talk quietly. While I don't recall the actual subject of the conversation right now, I remember it was an interesting one. Even though I wasn't involved in the discussion, I couldn't help but laugh when the two spoke. Then they started laughing, tears welling up in their eyes. In turn, my eyes started to fill with tears from the extreme laughter. One of the two girls looked at me and told her friend out loud "Look at her, she's smiling so hard at you, she's crying!" I almost couldn't help laughing for a long time and started introducing myself. Before I knew it, we were close friends, all thanks to the amazing power of laughter, which can bring strangers together into best friends.
I'm going to tell you a story about smiles, laughter and love. My @DATE3 story and how my smile and laughter changed the life of a girl and myself. I have three main memories from my time with her, the first smile, a day at the beach, and @TIME1 from @LOCATION4. From the very beginning, these memories were about me and my neighbor exchange student @PERSON1, and they weren't perfect. @TIME1 I made @PERSON1 smile. Here's a cool @DATE2 @TIME1 on my grandmother's back lawn overlooking the @ORGANIZATION1 Canyon, perfect for a fireworks show. The lawn is even sloped so you don't have to sit up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 came over to sit with me while I waited for the show. @PERSON1 sits on my left and @CAPS1, my neighbor and lifelong friend, sits on my right. I'm curious about @PERSON1, what kind of person she is, what part of @LOCATION3 she lives in, how her outfits are different from ours. So while we waited I started asking her some questions. I didn't get much, she was obviously shy, very shy. Finlay I got a conversation between the three of us about the firefighting project that had started. @PERSON1 told us that the fire in @LOCATION3's home is much bigger than ours. Of course, I'm sarcastically saying "@CAPS2 really". She just smiled. For the rest of @TIME1, the conversation between me and @PERSON1 was more free and it was a great night. Next we spend a day at the beach. This happens on @DATE1 in @TIME1 memory. @PERSON1 and I are good friends, she stopped being shy and I started to really like her. We arrived at the beach on @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1. The weather is starting to get hot and it's a perfect day at the beach. We unpacked towels and other random beach items. Soon we were all in the water, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 (@PERSON1's boarding sister), @CAPS4 (@CAPS1's boyfriend) and me. In a flirtatious mood, I started throwing water at @PERSON1, who happens to be @CAPS1. This started a very big splash war where everyone splashed everyone else. Everyone was laughing and having a good time. It stopped abruptly because everyone didn't want any more water. Shortly after I dived and tried to lift @PERSON1 and then put her in the water, its padding failed as I missed and only grabbed her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. It was a nice wet day at the beach. Finally, my @TIME1 memory is @TIME1 of @LOCATION4. We just finished dinner and this is @TIME1 by @PERSON1 at @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. By now, we were pretty much boyfriend girlfriends. @LOCATION2 @LOCATION4 is getting darker as we get to @LOCATION4's @LOCATION4 forMovies. @TIME1 on @CAPS7 is playing @TIME1. I found a good place to lay out the blanket. We lay there chatting and waiting for the movie to start. I am reminded of all the laughter that brings us together. I know I will really miss her now more than ever. It felt like the right moment for the sun to set over the valley, I leaned in and kissed her, she kissed back, and I'll spare you the rest. Later we laughed and cried. Because she was leaving early the next morning, we fell in love. Yes, I used the @CAPS8 world, but it was and is real. We definitely didn't want the movie to end, but it still ended. We talked about the amazing @DATE3 we had together and all the smiles and laughter we shared as I drove her back to her host family. @DATE3 I laughed a lot, it does get me very close to someone. @PERSON1 and I talk almost every day, it's hard, but I've never been as close to her as anyone else. I will always remember @DATE3, @DATE2 in @DATE2, that day at the beach and @TIME1 @TIME1 in @PERSON1 in @LOCATION1. I hope you enjoy my @DATE3 story and I hope you can have an amazing @DATE3 like me.
For teens, summer is always the highlight of the year. This is when the temperature is at its highest and we can stay outside and it is the fondest childhood memory we will never forget. That time of year never seems to be a dull moment. Everyone always seems to get together and find something crazy and fun to do. @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, I was sitting at home doing nothing and decided we were hungry. We had to walk around without a car, so we chose the closest place to @LOCATION1's house, which was @ORGANIZATION1. We left @ORGANIZATION1 at about ten and started walking around looking for something to do. We texted @CAPS1 and found out he was with @PERSON1, so we both decided to hang out at @ORGANIZATION2's house. We had absolutely no idea where he lived, so they asked us to meet them at the skate park. It was already dark and we were still walking. When we got to the park, it was already late. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 arrive in a few minutes, so we start walking towards @ORGANIZATION2's house. @PERSON1 has the most evil cat I've ever seen. @CAPS1 has told me stories before and has shown me videos of that cat a million times. When we got there it was bouncing off the wall and @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 and I was terrified. We didn't want it to come near us because we thought it would attack us and it ended up attacking us a few times. @PERSON1 Point the laser pointer all over the place, let the cat chase it, we just sit there, still bored. They were looking through our purses and found we had swimsuits because we went to the beach earlier, which gave them the idea to go fishing at @TIME1. We all squeezed into our cars and headed for the dyke. We got there in tank tops and shorts and it was cold. We huddled together to keep warm. We couldn't see the ground and kept tripping over small holes and tree trunks everywhere. We finally arrived at a small pier that looked ready to crack and sink. @PERSON1 grabs his @CAPS3 fishing rod and strides to the edge of the pier. The rest of us can't all stand on it without breaking. We took a lot of pictures, watched @PERSON1 try fishing, @CAPS1 just became @CAPS1 and we had a lot of fun. In the end, we found something we could do out of nothing. When people experience greatness in the little things, they realize they can enjoy more of everything. That night was one of the most memorable for @DATE1.
I was about ten years old when this story happened to me. I was with my grandma when the story happened. We were in the park and I stuck my head in the horizontal bar. My grandma went to the bathroom and I was stuck on the horizontal bar. The kids in the park thought it was funny and laughed at me. I'm really embarrassed. When I get my head off the bar, I tell the kids they should try to put their head in the bar. The other kids tried to do it and they all got their heads stuck on the horizontal bar. Kids don't know that I've practiced putting my head in the horizontal bar so it doesn't get stuck. I laughed so hard at what I just did, when my grandma came out, I asked if we could go home. The next day we went back to the park and I got some different kids using the same trick. What I don't understand is why they are trying the same thing if my head is stuck. This time the kids were there to tell mom and dad what I did and they told my grandma that I was in a lot of trouble. We went home and I was grounded for about two weeks. Next time I go to the park, I do the same thing. This shows that the child will be the child.
Friendship and laughter go to @CAPS1's best friend at @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and I would spend hours sitting on her bed without laughing. We can tell stories to each other that other people are just stupid, but we are hilarious. We would stay up all night watching long sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that's before all the big hits. We have fought before, but nothing like this. I know I'll make a decision that will ruin our friendship and take away all our laughter, but I can't let her get away with what she did. So I say goodbye. The name of @CAPS3's best friend is @CAPS4, and we already know that the two of us are inseparable from each other. We love to hang out and be together. It was until the fight was told that she had been lying about a boy and I remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear she would do this to me. But I didn't care enough to ask her, so I ended the friendship. It hurts, but I say it myself to believe it's all true. However, I didn't feel that something was wrong, things told me that it was not hers. But I don't want to hear it. I ignored the feeling and just moved on with life. This is one of the hardest things I've ever done in @CAPS3 life. School is another thing, and it's really hard to stay mad at other people when you have the same friends and a couple take classes together. It's like I have to keep reminding myself "you're not a friend, you didn't talk to her", subconsciously a friendship I don't want to end. I missed talking to her so one day I said hello and after that we talked non-stop like nothing happened, what happened between us. Except one or two things are missing, lol. It feels so close that we're getting closer, we haven't talked about the fight yet, but it's come to a point where we can occasionally laugh or giggle at ourselves at some of the laughs people say, but never the kind of laughs we use to share. It never occurred to me that we could have spoken again, but as friends. After a few weeks, we all sighed for the youth camp. In that camp, I found the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and came to the consensus that the whole fight had gone through our two breakdowns. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and she because she didn't try hard enough to tell me the truth. During this time, we shed a few tears as we talked and actually laughed together for the first time in about four months. The tension between us was broken, it fell on our shoulders like we were all carrying heavy bags all the time. We both apologized for all our parts and went to dinner, laughing the whole meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it's a very important part of life, and you laugh most when you're with someone you love. Sam and I are still working on what's going on between us, but we're closer on our way than ever. We laughed all the time and there was never a dull moment, we all decided to work really hard without another fight between us. We all realize that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and friendly laughter. I love @CAPS3 best friends so much and I love how much laughter we share together and I don't want to lose any more. So every day I make sure we laugh as much as possible and I never take our friendship for granted again.
Laughter is always the answer. It was cold and dark outside. The way home is long, but the laughter in the air makes it faster and shorter. The cars kept going by and going upstairs, but all we could do was laugh a little longer because we knew we were kidding ourselves and we didn't care. The weird sounds that keep coming out of our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and facial expressions are the funniest thing for us. The stupid things people do are the funniest things. Because I know that if you laugh more than usual, you will make more friendships and live a more fulfilling life. When @PERSON2 and I walked home from @PERSON1, we were walking home. It seems to take two hours because of how long it takes to get there, when it's actually about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we weren't getting anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking about how long it would take. Cars keep passing us by, but they are not yet coming towards us. It didn't go quiet until something popped into my head. I have the best idea so the walk will be faster. I remember this voice of my god bro @CAPS2 compared to me like @CAPS3 even though he always did when he was younger. It always makes everyone smile, which is funny. I wanted to try this sound, so I tried it. We weren't home until I started yelling at the car, a dark, scary voice, and I sounded in control. Then I had the great idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. Also a bad idea, @PERSON2 started dancing and cars started staring at us. @PERSON2 is my best friend, this tall, skinny girl who loves piercings and doesn't care what people think of her. I really don't mind what they think of us because people know we're weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice is the funniest thing I've ever seen. I never thought there would be anything funnier than this until she wanted to try the sound. When she tried the sound, it slipped out of her lips and I started laughing and fell to the ground. About ten minutes later, we almost got to my house and it felt like our stomachs were about to burst as we laughed long and hard. When I muttered to myself, I thought "@CAPS4, it seems like it only takes two minutes to get home." I knew that time would go by faster if @PERSON2 and I just wanted to do something before going home. When we walked in the door of my house my mom asked us, "@CAPS5 are you guys dancing as you walk along @NUM1 and I just looked at each other and smiled and told her she didn't even know how funny it was. lol Sound is the only thing that brings two people closer. It doesn't matter if you're kidding yourself because you know what's interesting. What matters is you and the relationship you're building. Whether it's just friends trying to learn more about each other, or if It's boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and fooling around. It's always good to have a good laugh here and there, without you having that connection with the other person and without your friendship still there.
On @DATE1, the main group of friends will be looking for different adventures to get involved, this group consisting of kids of all ages, @PERSON5 @NUM1, @PERSON1 @NUM2, @PERSON2 @NUM3, and @PERSON4 @NUM4. Late around @DATE2, on a hot day, @PERSON5 had an idea to head to @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2 to go cliff diving. He called it "The Cliff." So the whole group got together and took off for the one hour drive to @LOCATION2. Once they got there, but only got the heat outside, and the need to cool off was increasingly becoming a priority. They stop and then walk the train tracks. The closer they got to their destination, the louder their @CAPS1 hearing became. There are secluded areas with rocky floors on the spot, and people get a good start by jumping off the highest peaks and going slapping below the surface of the water. Right now @PERSON5 and @PERSON1 want to settle down so they can join others. As for @PERSON4 and @PERSON2, it can wait. Once @PERSON1 and @PERSON5 got their first couple jumps, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 thought maybe it was time to give it a try. But not from the highest peak. Maybe something is a little low. Like the bottommost cliff, it's just the beginning. Before they jumped off, they found a small beach at the other end of the creek, so the girls talked to the boys, they all decided to jump off at the same time, and swim to the small beach. Although they all jumped from different heights, they all seemed to arrive everywhere at the same time. For @PERSON5 it's more of a struggle a bit and swim so far. But @PERSON4 is right by his side to help him along the way. As @DATE1 airs, while relaxing the group, they become aware they @CAPS1 are hungry, but more lazy to swim back, climb rocks, and walk on rails back to the car. But hunger is taking over. When they swam back, climbed the rocks, collected their belongings, and walked back, they started brainstorming places to eat. "@CAPS1 is going to go through @CAPS2." @PERSON1 said. "@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1!" @PERSON4 shouted. Make a decision at that moment. On the ride back, they swapped drivers and seating arrangements. Once they got @CAPS2 they all stopped at @ORGANIZATION1 and stuffed their tummy too. They have all chosen to stop working at @PERSON5 @ORGANIZATION3 to say hi to some of his friends. @PERSON4 is what @PERSON5 girlfriends let them have something to show off. They are all done saying hello, go back and park all the cars @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1 house. @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 decided to take a shower, while @PERSON1 wanted to play some video games, for @PERSON2, she headed home to take a shower, ready to meet back up with her friends. @NUM5 hours later, they all head to the scene where they hang out, they are called "points". They invited a couple who are friends @PERSON6 @NUM3, and @PERSON3 may @NUM7. They made a bonfire while the sun went down as it grew to get colder and colder. While @PERSON1, @Person3 may, @PERSON6 and @PERSON2 @CAPS1 sit around the chair fire, @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 @CAPS1 around the camp (which is a huge chunk of real @PERSON5 mom's land) riding in four . The crew will take turns riding the four, but ride on a particular one and gain a certain memory. Once @PERSON5 and @PERSON4 are back, @PERSON2 wants to give @PERSON4 a ride or so. So @PERSON5 jumps off, and @PERSON2 jumps on, as @PERSON4 wraps her arms around her waist and they take off. There are certain clues that there is a long way to go in the ride, so the driver always has to find a way to maneuver around it. Usually it works, this time it didn't. @PERSON2 hesitant to just ride right here. She is afraid of all power. @PERSON4 really doesn't seem to care, she takes over stomping the gas. They tall tail it's log and just roll four. @PERSON4 didn't weigh too much to let her fly away, @PERSON2 on the other hand got under the handle to grab her feet. @PERSON4 had the strength to lift her feet four off, and @PERSON2 went right out. @PERSON4 decided to call the boys and they jumped right into @PERSON1 to save them. @PERSON5 flipped the four right above and got it, driving back to the back of @PERSON1. The memory will no longer be forgotten with the group, even though the group will always be the same.
@CAPS1 @CAPS2 TRAVEL I just woke up when I heard a burst of laughter from under the stairs. I went downstairs and saw @PERSON2, my manager laughing with one of my employees, @PERSON1. She drove me and @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 on a plane to @LOCATION1. I was scared because my dad Jack died on the plane. I'm not going to focus on this topic I'm going to focus on. When we landed it was the most fun ride :) @CAPS2 the bump was so bumpy, @CAPS3 we found our luggage and went to the shuttle hotel we drove to. We paid for the shuttle and headed to our hotel room (I laughed at @LOCATION2 for spilling soda on his shirt). @CAPS3 We had to stay at the hotel the first day since we only had 2 days of park funnel, for dinner we had a restaurant called chubby s which was the worst food I've ever had, the fries were cold , the meat wasn't fully cooked and we didn't have ice in our soda. The next day we were ready, I was wearing a polo shirt and some sunglasses and some shorts, and the shoes I was wearing were Converse (low cut) don't you think it's trendy @CAPS4 (lol)
My family and I moved from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4 when I was a kid. We moved to @CAPS1 town @ORGANIZATION2 where we lived for @NUM1 years. There have been many tough times over the years, but we can always get through them by laughing together as a family. The past year has been particularly difficult, and I don't think we could have survived without us. Celebrate tragic moments with laughter. When we moved to @LOCATION1, my @CAPS2 stayed at @LOCATION5 because he was sick and didn't think he would survive the trip. Last year, we finally convinced him to @CAPS3 with his family. He moved in with my family and shared my bedroom. It was difficult because he was snoring and making weird noises in his sleep, but I'm glad he was with us. When I wake up tired from lack of sleep, I just think of funny sounds and laugh. Then, six months ago, my @CAPS2 was diagnosed with a brain tumor. There was nothing the doctors could do about him, they told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated and I couldn't stop crying. We asked @CAPS2 what he wanted to do. He said, "I want you guys to stop looking like I'm dead, let's go play!" It's like @CAPS2. He said we were going on a trip to @LOCATION2 so he could go to @LOCATION3 before leaving this world. I can't help laughing at how crazy he is. Sure enough, when I got home from school the following @DATE1, @CAPS2 told us we had ten minutes to pick up what we needed and get in the car. He went out and rented a @NUM2 coach for the trip so everyone in the family could go. We just stared at him. He started laughing and telling him, "@CAPS3 or you'll stay!" I laughed too, and hurried in to pack my things. This is the best trip of my life. @CAPS2 tells us all kinds of crazy stories about his childhood. Mom wrote some of them down so we can remember them forever. When we got to @LOCATION3, we had every ride in the park. @CAPS2's favorite is @ORGANIZATION1. He shouldn't be riding it because of his condition, but he just laughed and said, "I'm sure it won't kill me." @CAPS4 Although he said it made me sad, I laughed because he was so happy . Two months after we went home, @CAPS2 died. @CAPS4 While it was tough and I cried a lot about it, I couldn't help laughing when I thought about that trip and how much fun we had. @CAPS2 told me that laughter can change anything.
My newest robot friend and I have been dating for almost @NUM1 months on @DATE1 and it will be a year. We had a lot of fun together, we talked about anything we didn't really bike or jog, we just started working out together. My parents love him, they call him son-in-law, I think it's kind of cute.. but anyway, we had a great time on New Year's Eve, we hang out with a friend of Jos's, his name is Randy, We were doing the normal thing grilling everything. It's like @TIME1, we're ready for bed, Randy doesn't know the night we're staying, but we do. Randy owns a hotel near Greyback and they don't have an extra bed there, so we asked Randy if he could use a hotel room and he said sure. @TIME1 The day we had to pay him a little, not the whole, but part of it, and we went to the hotel room. I was watching it with @CAPS1 and it had a king size bed with a big hot tub and I jumped on it and it was the best. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 put on a pair of shorts and I @CAPS2 my swimsuit put us @CAPS2 in the heatpipe and it blew up :) Well when I tried to get out of the heatpipe I slipped and I caught Own. Glad I didn't fall in my face and then @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came out and did the same, which is kind of funny but not true, but at the same time. Me and @CAPS1 are really hungry and when @CAPS1 eats chips we just have a bag of chips and some cheese dip and he makes this funny sound like star wars character chubaka This is the best time for us @CAPS2 to watch sadalight tv, I don't have one at home so we just have to watch dvds and some vhs, but we brought @NUM2 anyway. We played this game called Metal Honor in the room and it was kind of like a war game but there were a lot of guns and we kind of turned the tv on but I don't think it was that loud, nehbordid I guess. About @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes later we heard a knock on the door and it was a neighbor asking him if everything was okay because he heard loud noises and gunshots coming from the room and we said yes of course everything was fine Well, it's just a game we have for playstation sorry to bother sir, I don't think the sound is that loud. So we did turn the tv off and we played @NUM5 hours so when we went to bed it was like @NUM6 @TIME1 I was so tired in the morning @TIME1 day I had to go to school very @ TIME1 days. We @CAPS2 got up and took a shower and then went back to Randy's house and we sat there for breakfast and I think we had the beak and gravy which was the best thing I've ever had a good time with. After breakfast we went home and had some more at my house and like around @NUM7 we decided we were going to take a nap and then we slept until @TIME1 day. @CAPS1 and I @CAPS2 got up at @NUM8 and we couldn't sleep because we stayed up playing video games @NUM9 hours and I had to get up to go to school, I walked into my dad's house and took a shower @CAPS2 ready for school Then went to my house and @CAPS2 in my school uniform brushed my hair and brushed my teeth and then I @CAPS2 put all my stuff together and then around @NUM10 I went out to my bus stop and waited when I came back to my house when I realized there was no one outside and @CAPS1 laughed and said "I asked what you were laughing about and he said you know it's @DATE2 and you didn't go to school and I was like this is crazy, I thought I was @DATE3 and he said no, it was @DATE2. I had the best new year of my life and I wish there was another one like this, maybe if we were still together on my birthday we might do something What hope is fun. But I think we'll @CAPS1 be nice to me and I'm so grateful for him and what he's done for me. He also has one of my best friends ever, hopefully we'll be together for a long time .
@CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Great grandmother once told me that laughter adds five extra years to your life, she is @NUM1 now. Laughter can bring a new element to a relationship; they embark on a journey, whether it's between two friends, family, or someone else. More or less, laughter is an essential part. Sometimes you feel closer because it breaks down the barriers that define acquaintances and friends, but that's actually how I met a good friend of @CAPS3. The incoming @CAPS11 is participating in a traditional ceremony (name game) where the high school passes the incoming @CAPS11 through orientation. They put us in long queues face to face. For this particular game, you have to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner, as well as a fun fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found the assignment ridiculous and awkward, but if we could laugh it out loud. A whole new feeling enveloped the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling just drifted away, all because of the laughter. It breaks down that barrier and opens up our hearts. I think the saying "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" is true. @CAPS4 supports some of @CAPS3's best friendships are cultivated through laughter. For example, when I joined the cross country team, unlike most other sports teams, the whole team was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, t-shirts, shorts, water, and sometimes even our watches, but we also share a lot of laughs. Even when we run, we chat and joke with our friends, but believe that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3's best memory of all this is when we had "@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9". The entire team of about 18 @CAPS7 or so met at @LOCATION1's home a week before the constituency. @CAPS10 for snacks, @CAPS11 for drinks, @CAPS12 for candy, and @CAPS13 for the “main ingredients”. The first position for @CAPS8 is not bad, but everyone is expecting that 12 o'clock. We are @CAPS9 when it happens. The "main ingredient" of @CAPS8 is toilet paper. We're going to @CAPS9 for a pee raid! The first event was turning off the coach lawn; but not just any old forks, these forks were special. Coach has this weird obsession with @CAPS14 for some reason, so despite this, some @CAPS7 pics put his head on @CAPS14's lawn. I was completely stunned, it was impossible not to laugh. I don't think I can get @CAPS16 to have something so clever. After that little stop, we moved on to the main activity, which was kick-off peeing. We tried to go to one of the brothers in the pee line, but Dad was already there waiting. Next up is another pair of brothers. With all the cars slowly approaching the end, we lowered the radio and turned off all the headlights. For safety, everyone made sure to park at least four houses outside and leave all doors open for a quick escape. Almost simultaneously, everyone threw them towards the big tree next to the house first. We kept missing, the rolls would fall off and litter the streets, some might call us the worst tee ever. Then all of a sudden, the trio ran @CAPS9 on a skateboard with their own toilet paper rolls, yelling, "@CAPS15! Come back here you forgot!". We were ambushed! Sprinting back, we barely caught up to the car. However, something always felt wrong. There is a weird feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we started driving away, something big hit the car. A panicked @ORGANIZATION1 pulled over and had to ask @CAPS9 to make sure no one was hit. "@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!" a low voice shouted. All @CAPS7 started screaming in horror. What will happen now? In the end what happened? Will we be killed? No, luckily we didn't get killed by @CAPS8! Relief that we only found @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. In an instant, the whole group burst into laughter @CAPS9, I was laughing so hard I started crying. I've laughed so much or so hard in my life @CAPS3 that I'll never forget it. The laughter of @MONTH1 was not just two people getting together, but nearly twenty people. As regions come and go, I know everyone is sad that the @CAPS16 season is coming to an end. This was last season's @CAPS13 and no one wanted to see them go; but we'll never lose all the good times and the bond is @CAPS2.
What a laugh! How many friends do you really have? What is your relationship with others? Well, when I was in high school, I usually didn't have that many friends. However, I have a few friends with a friend of mine @CAPS4, and it is said that I really love something. (@CAPS1 don't know) @CAPS2 one year, I'm a newbie, I go to church with some of my friends and they are a @NUM1 grade fall on the pond/water, I don't know if @CAPS20 @CAPS1 is @CAPS3 or not so I ended up coming to him and asked.Me ;? @CAPS4 you @CAPS3? You need some help @CAPS1 said. @CAPS6, its @CAPS3 I just sprained ankle.Me; @CAPS3, watch you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS9 sure, @CAPS6 issue! Next year, when I was a sophomore, I didn't realize that @CAPS1 would be them as a freshman! His name is @CAPS11 and I started hanging out with him more because @CAPS1 is really fun and sweet. We went to the @CAPS12 ball with the rest of our friends it was theirs but I was worried about something but @CAPS1 made it buttery because at the time I was scared and my ex was theirs. @CAPS11 was they helped me and I didn't know how to dance, they were the last one in a song, I didn't realize that I was dancing until @CAPS1 told me I was so after dancing with him I finally asked him @ CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends, @CAPS1 said it was able to live so I ended up dancing with @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 was them when I needed him. Outside of our final title, my name is @CAPS13 @CAPS14 was picked up. So, in the meantime, we waited for her outside. We are laughing at some jokes we @CAPS15 say to each other. Like one is @CAPS1 @CAPS15 something in his @CAPS15 thing, mannerisms, it's some sort of magic wand for school building, @CAPS15 asks so it's changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I ended up sneaking behind him and scaring him so badly I ended up laughing, @CAPS1 too. Since @CAPS1 doesn't usually get freaked out like, and @CAPS1 told me that @CAPS1 was going to get me back, I started freaking out from me and didn't know what @MONTH1 was. @CAPS11 is a great help when I need him! The laughing thing in life is that you need to eat ether so you're in it for fun and mood.The main thing from my house is whether we're pranking each other or not; like my sister would come out of the room and her soda was in the room Here, I'm still in @CAPS15 about half of the soda on the table they could have mustard and she hates the mustard formed, but my dad tastes like, what I meant to do, is to put a little bit of mustard in her soda the same thing. When she came back to the room I smiled and my dad looked at me with my @CAPS17 too. My sister ended up having some soda and she looked at my @CAPS14 and was like; @CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS14 and I are laughing and she hates mustard! @CAPS20 That thing that I don't like, is that I've done it too much with my soda. So, the main thing I want to say is that they are some laughs that are funny. Not all laughter is not funny. It's buttery @CAPS20 you don't mess with people that are close to your heart because they @MONTH1 you pissed off. Like my sister, @PERSON2 is pissing me off when it's not me, it's my dad's idea.
@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @DATE1 the day I'm turning @NUM1 and I'm at home with my best friend, I'm calling him to see what he's planning for this sunny day, he Tell me he has nothing, so we've been thinking about something, but @NUM2 hours we've had no luck. I called him again and we met at an elementary school and sat down on a bench in @CAPS3 and started calling people to see what was up with everyone and no one would answer. When we stopped calling people to make planes, it became about @NUM3 o'clock, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get a bite to eat, and I told him for sure because we had no luck throughout @DATE2 @TIME1. Too bad it's @DATE2 for @DATE3 and school is about to start @CAPS3 @DATE4. So when we walked to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flyer that said @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see what was going on. We followed the directions to a street we knew very well until we started hearing music in the distance, so we walked over a mile and saw a good friend of mine who told me he was going to pick up the lights @ORGANIZATION1 I asked him who was there and he told me I needed to see for myself. So we walked to the corner @CAPS3 saw @ORGANIZATION1, walked to the door and saw other friends standing at the door, we asked him where everyone was, we were bored all day with nothing to do @CAPS3 my own @CAPS1 , he told me to be here right now and that's what matters so we walked in and saw everyone we called @DATE5 and so on and they screamed at me @CAPS5 @CAPS1 I was shocked why this @ORGANIZATION1 is for me how I had my own @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 accident. I finally found out that it was always planned for me, I guess the restaurant flyer was put there @CAPS3 purpose and my friend is @CAPS3 this little @CAPS2 let me go to @ORGANIZATION1 and it was all planned from the beginning , people don't answer my calls or my friends, but instead ask me to go get some food, find flyers, let me go to my own @ORGANIZATION1, I thank everyone, especially my friends, I go to buy food to find me Own @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 flyer, we all had a good laugh, @CAPS8!
That night my @CAPS1, my friend and myself were on the road driving to pick up a mutual youth group friend. Our conversation was nothing special. We're mostly just telling stories about the fun times we've had with old friends and looking forward to creating some new ones together. She is such an amazing person. Always be ready to make a joke, make new friends and have fun. Her smile is lovely and she's more than willing to convince people to do anything. When we drove to her house, we were happy to see her again. It's been a few weeks since our last "game date" and we can't wait to catch up with her. She walked out of her front door and trotted to our car. The smile on her face is enough to tell us that the reunion feels mutual. After getting out of the car, we got her bear hug. The happy times we spent together flashed through my mind and I hope one day I can look back for more. We all got in the car, left her neighborhood, and started walking down the road. I realized we were going the wrong way. "@CAPS1, we have to go back, don't we?" I asked. "@CAPS2, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't allow me to turn @CAPS3 until a little bit on the street," she said. "@CAPS4, is this legal?" I asked, knowing the answer was no. "@CAPS5, I really have no choice right now, @CAPS6?" I could hear the sarcasm in her voice. She can make her voice and appearance sound and look mean, but I know she's actually just kidding me. The barrier dissipated and she was about to turn to @CAPS3. Turning the steering wheel, she was barely able to cross the end of the obstacle, but it was too late to stop in time to clear the curb on the other side. She accidentally fell on the side of the road, causing those of us in the back seat to jump from the impact and wobble. My friend and I both laughed knowing that she is usually careful and drives well. "@CAPS8 everyone," she said. Her body language shows she's happy, but she's really @CAPS8 for giving us such a shock. Our answer was pure laughter. "@CAPS5, I guess that's our fun this month," she said, her eyes twinkling with joy that made us laugh. She was always quick to joke about the situation we were in. She pulled forward and as we drove away the rear fender scraped off the curb again. Driving away, my friends and I were still laughing, replaying in our minds what just happened to us. This is one of our fondest memories together. An ongoing joke we can mention and laugh out loud for. "@CAPS10 take @PERSON1," my friends said as we got off. We walked into the youth group with a smile, knowing this would be one of many memories we will treasure forever. Let's get closer than ever.
My best friend @CAPS1 and I have known each other since we were two years old. We help each other in good times and bad and like chocolate in bad days. The best quality of @CAPS1 is that she makes me laugh no matter what my mood is. This year @CAPS1 decided to go to @ORGANIZATION4, an all girls @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, instead of continuing to go @organizations like me. The first day of @ORGANIZATION2 I could feel something was missing. @CAPS1. It felt eerily quiet without her giggling in the hallway. It reminds me of a place where we make most of our happy memories, and where we're told to "shush" quite a bit. Our little brick @CAPS3 church! Most @DATE1, I stand at the altar with the pastor and help him prepare bread or something. Most @DATE1, my best friend @CAPS1 is on the bench. A special @DATE1 I will never forget, @CAPS1 thought it would be fun to sit front row with family and make faces at me throughout Mass. See @CAPS1 she has the ability to make you laugh by smiling at you. I usually burst into tears when she grimaced. I stood in front of the entire congregation and tried my best not to laugh out loud. The congregation must think I've really been changed by @CAPS8 because I have the biggest smile on my face. I'm sure you've been in a situation where you feel like you can't stop laughing. You have to bite your lip, think something sad, or try breathing exercises. Every time I looked in her direction, a new laugh washed over me, and every time I looked in her direction, her evil eyes burned even brighter. After what felt like an eternity, the choir sang the closing hymn, and once we left the building, I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I bit so hard that there was a bumpy bulge in the inside of my mouth. Usually after church we walk over to @ORGANIZATION3 for coffee and donuts. We caught up with @ORGANIZATION2 and now live with each other because we don't see each other very often. She told me about her new friend and I told her about our old friend. I always look forward to hearing the hilariously silly stories of her days, and I always tell her the latest and greatest gossip from home. But what we always count on is a good laugh with good friends. The laughter keeps @CAPS1, I close. If laughter really prolongs your life, we might be two old ladies living in the mountains with twenty cats and no one really knows their ages because they've been around forever. I can be myself around her and know she accepts me because if I do something stupid I know she'll laugh and then we'll play with her cat @LOCATION2 or make popcorn and watch @ORGANIZATION2 three. My family must be tired of our endless inside jokes. When I laugh it feels like liquid gold is bubbling in my stomach and everything is peaceful in the world. It's one of the most comforting feelings in the world. This is how it feels when I laugh with my best friend @CAPS1.
Columns of light shot from the misty windows, casting a shadowy glare on the table surface. A massive sign hovers over the wide oak shelving that borders the entire dining area. @CAPS16 reads "@CAPS1's" in capital letters buried deep in decades of dust. My eyes danced through the jumble of antiques and statues in the room, filling every crevice easily. These objects form a family of outliers, each belonging to the @CAPS15 restaurant. Huge posters of All-@CAPS2 athletes tower over the @NUM1-inch flat screen, while the pungent smell of moulded wood and fermented beer lingers. Many bras fell from the ceiling of the bar at @CAPS15 next to the entrance. The crunching sound echoed in my ears as the waitress moved over the falling peanut shells. That's what @CAPS4 differentiates this place from the rest. There were buckets of @TIME1's cracked shells and peanut mud scattered all over the floor as @CAPS16 was custom made for customers @CAPS15 threw them on the ground. And of course my family; a lively group of five squeezed our circular frame into a booth that could comfortably fit four. We seem to @CAPS15 blend well with the clutter in our "@DATE1 @CAPS3" skirts and suits. Distraught, I scrambled through the menu looking for something with a little zest and a lot of calories. A loud bang interrupted my concentration, and I slid the newspaper-style menu under my eyes. Across the table sits my grandmother. Standing proudly at @NUM2, a petite old lady spends her free time trying out stand-up comedy. I studied the glass jar of ketchup she was holding and watched as she smashed a peanut into the corner. The shell cracks open, and @ORGANIZATION1 picks out the nut and sweeps its kernels to the floor. I'm giggling @CAPS15, I'm amazed at the limitations of @CAPS4, the old lady willing @CAPS15 to go @CAPS15. She went on @CAPS15 to repeat the process, eating ten more peanuts, until the whole family stopped in curiosity. Looking up, @LOCATION1 stopped, the jar dangling in her hand. "@CAPS4? I'm just trying new ways to crack the puzzle." @LOCATION1 exclaimed paused in hilarious response. Nothing happened and we started thinking about our meal choices again. Minutes later, a burly waitress, reeking of drugstore perfume and @TIME1's hangover, put down a glass of water and dragged on slowly. Raising the glass, @CAPS5 motioned us @CAPS15 to follow. "@CAPS6!" @CAPS7 rang each of our glasses in turn. "@CAPS6! And @CAPS6 @CAPS15 Cherry people!" @LOCATION1 pitched. "@CAPS9 @CAPS10!" I shouted involuntarily. My parents laughed immediately because my grandmother was never funny. @CAPS16 is a joke, no one in the family laughs at @LOCATION1's comments, only herself, this is what @CAPS16 is like. Years ago, my brother thought she was joking "@CAPS9 @CAPS10" because she was pretending to be a comedian, but it wasn't. Since then, @CAPS15 has responded with a quick "@CAPS9 @CAPS10!" every time @LOCATION1 made a "joke". @CAPS15 On this day, she neither improved nor gave up a daily opportunity @CAPS15 to try @CAPS15 to win her audience. In quiet fail @LOCATION1 chuckles to herself @CAPS15 and focuses on the menu. A few seconds later, she was back in the ring for the second round. "Noon at @CAPS16. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have brunch?! I'm dying here, just already laughing," she pleaded. For a moment, we all just stared at her. Innocent glances back; the predator sits calmly waiting for its prey to move. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, we looked at each other and the ribbon was cut. Tea party laughter erupted into hoarse cries as thunderous laughter echoed through the room. I hand my mom a napkin and she taps her happy tears with @CAPS15. The thick wooden table slammed shut under my father's hysterical slap on the tabletop. I'm laughing so hard my gut hurts but I don't understand why everything is so funny. All the while, @ORGANIZATION1 was delighted to finally get a sincere response to @CAPS15 for her infamous off-the-cuff "jokes". @CAPS16 is the miracle we didn't get kicked out of the restaurant. Customers from the surrounding booths stared at us from the edge of their benches, looking at us in disgust. However, this isn't the first time, and certainly not a farce my family has sparked at @TIME1. The bland and obnoxious joke is a loose comrade in our family that always finds its place in our enduring memoirs. The rest of the meal was spent with bouts of giggling, and once our meal was done, we were graciously escorted out the door. It's when you're hysterical for no reason and can't find out that @CAPS16 has little sense of humor by retelling the rest of @CAPS16. ) @CAPS16 are those insignificant moments in life when we are reminded of who we are and the bonds we share. Laughter is a connection, a form of love nurtured in society and in families with grandmothers like me, every "@CAPS9 @CAPS10" deserves @CAPS16.
Long time ago my family @CAPS6 I went to @LOCATION1 to see my aunt @CAPS6 uncle. They have a cabin by the lake and a @CAPS1 tent in the backyard. They have a marina with a very big @CAPS6 beautiful boat. I went with my @CAPS2, my other aunt @CAPS6 and my two half sisters. I forget why we went, but I think it's just because @DATE2 @CAPS6 my aunt @CAPS6 uncle is getting old. I'm young, @CAPS7 I just remember the bits and pieces of travel @CAPS6. I remember my sister and I watching cartoons on the couch, watching "@CAPS3 @CAPS4" in our bedroom, having my sisters show me my first horror movie (I hate horror movies), going to the cart Track @CAPS6 driving for the first time, went to the lake with an extra boat @CAPS6 with one of my sisters, and went for a ride on the lake with my uncle in a big boat @CAPS6 who would go in circles @CAPS7 we would jump on the waves, let Riding is more fun! We bypass @DATE1, @CAPS6 of course they sell illegal fireworks all over the state, but I remember sitting in the car with my two half-sisters, @CAPS6 my @CAPS2 got off the car for @CAPS6 Fireworks are set off from one of the stands on the side of the road. @CAPS7 We're all tired of something, @CAPS7 We're all in the car. Outside their little stand selling fireworks is this balloon blower; you know one of those things that looks like a blast with a face on it @CAPS6 it won't stop moving @CAPS6 dancing? Anyway, my eldest half-sister started saying "@CAPS5 watch him do the macarana!" I don't know what @CAPS13 is talking about until she points at the one who's writhing @CAPS6 every second guy. Then my other half sister joined @CAPS6 and started saying "@CAPS6 now he's making mashed potatoes!" @CAPS7 Now I'm laughing because it's just @CAPS7 silly @CAPS6 funny I actually thought he was dancing @CAPS6 doing all These dance moves! Now everyone in the car is laughing @CAPS6 giggling @CAPS7 Silly @CAPS6 Funny, I mean we throw stupid dance moves, some of which aren't even dance moves, just random objects! "@CAPS8!" "@CAPS9 @CAPS10!" "@CAPS11!" "@CAPS12!" We can't stop laughing! When my @CAPS2 got in the car she was like "@CAPS13!? @CAPS13 Happened?!". I tried to explain to her that @CAPS13 was @CAPS7 funny, but she didn't get it. I guess you just need to be there to stop in the ridiculous cars on the side of the road where they sell fireworks and see why @CAPS7 is fun!
Laughter is very important in everyone's life because it can help you in many ways. As far as I know, laughter has helped me with a lot of emotional issues that I have with many ex-boyfriends. One day my mom saw me cry because my ex broke up with me and I was really upset so the only thing my mom said to me was "Laughter is the best doctor" and I didn't Understand what she's trying to say so to speak, but now that I'm getting older, I'm starting to realize that she's thinking about it that it's no use getting depressed about things like this, I have to live a full life because I'm young, It's okay to cry for someone I just have a simple crush on her and she's totally right about that. But then again, it's not just about boyfriends and girlfriends, it's about maintaining healthy friendships with your friends. Laughter is a way of expressing your inner feelings. Even when I don't feel like laughing, I still laugh because it's a way to show people that I'm a strong and independent girl who knows how to take care of herself and live her life. I also try to make the people around me laugh and let us have fun while hanging out because they create the best memories. I'm amazed that a simple laugh or smile can make one person feel better, and sometimes one person can make another smile by simply laughing at the simplest things. On the other hand, some people smirk meaning they are just laughing, but not because they think the yew is funny they are laughing, but because they think the yew is acting stupid. But the truth is sometimes it's hard to tell who's real from a fake because there are a lot of people who fake smiles just to pretend they like you when they really don't and I really think that's stupid because you end up believing They are your friends and all they do is laugh behind your back. But I'm not going to let this affect me because that kind of person isn't even worth spending time with you. I'm also happy when I make the people I care about smile and have a good time because it makes me feel like I'm making a difference in someone's day and I know I can't change their lives but I can always Make their day easier by making them laugh. My 3 month old little sister is always laughing and laughing all the time for no reason and I have a funny laugh watching her laugh and when i say a simple smile or a big laugh of a person this is what i think Said another can make a difference. I mean she's only three months and she's always happy and always has a smile on her face for no reason and sometimes when she suddenly starts laughing she makes my day better and I think it's a bit cute. My mom sometimes wants to laugh because she knows I'm having a bad time at school sometimes and she'll try to make me laugh because when I laugh it makes me forget all my problems and everything but I know laughing can't always be It's all good, like laughing at other people's pain is bad, it's not funny, people do laugh at other people, it really hurts someone. The meaning of laughter can be good or bad in many ways, but it also depends on the person who laughs.
I personally do believe that laughter is very important in any relationship. Who doesn't like a laugh every now and then? I know I know. My true story is about my relationship with my @NUM1 year old toddler daughter. I'll tell you why I think laughter is important, how important it is, the role it plays in my relationships, and the benefits I believe it can bring to any relationship. Everyone needs to smile, just laugh and forget about the things that make you frown so you can turn it upside down. My relationship with @PERSON1 (my @NUM1 year old) has always been mixed and constantly changing. Emotions range from complete happiness and admiration to anger, frustration and a lot of stress. Of course, with all these different feelings, I always loved her with every inch of my heart. But when she's stressed enough to scream, she'll say the funniest things or make the cutest expressions. You can't help but smile and laugh, and let me tell you, it makes all the difficulties melt away in that brief moment. The coldest, angriest, most hurtful person in the world never smiles. They isolate themselves and do not have good relationships with others. In order not to feel down and sad, we all need some laughter. If you're always frowning and stressed out, there's no room to see good things and just laugh. When @PERSON1 does her little things and makes me laugh, she laughs and we're all in a better mood. She knows mom still loves her, she knows the right way to make me smile, I just want to hug her and squeeze her. Because at the end of the day, when you think about all the things that happened during the day, good or bad, there's really nothing you can do but laugh. It makes your day worthwhile. It doesn't have to be your child that makes you laugh , it can be any relationship with anyone. Maybe it's your relationship with your boyfriend, you've been together for a long time, you laugh? Because honestly, how can you put up with being with someone all the time, saying you love them and what not, but never laugh with them? They never make you laugh? It just doesn't add up.. it doesn't really matter unless there's some laughs. Especially if it's someone you love and spend a lot of time together. The good things in life need to surpass the bad things. So, the more laughter the better. I know how stressful parenting can be, especially as a teen mom. When she put a smile on my face, I forgot the stress of that moment and it made everything better. I would like to give an example when laughter really affects my day, or even my entire week. So you know when something doesn't go well for you, you fight with your parents or your boyfriend or whoever, you feel bad all day and for the week. You haven't laughed, you haven't laughed, you haven't done anything funny because it seems like you've been dragging the same old routine for the past few days. Then, the weekend comes and I personally find a babysitter and you hang out with a friend or two. We all got together and started talking about old memories, good and bad, that embarrassed you, or made you want to cry. But if it's told in the right way, you've got stories that always make you laugh. You seem to be laughing for hours (but in reality, only @NUM3 minutes). Eventually, you are forced to stop laughing because you laugh so hard you start crying. Your stomach hurts like you did fifty sit-ups, it hurts badly, but you feel fine. Then we just lay there and catch our breath. The only noise you hear is a slight laugh from someone's mouth every thirty seconds or so. So, all in all, this is how I look at laughter and why I think it's important in everyone's life. It makes you happy when you are sad. When you're stressed out, it can make you forget all the bad things and only think about the good. When you have the worst week of your life and then you finally get to spend the weekend with the girls, you laugh out loud and you feel like a new guy. Laughter is good for the soul, and I think it works your stomach muscles too. No matter who you are or what the problem is, laughter will make you feel better and forget about bad things.
@LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 want to travel, and while travel is fun, it’s more exciting to go with someone you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with someone you @MONTH1 don’t know very well. Every two years or so, my @ORGANIZATION1 choir gets a chance to travel together. On these trips, students can work with college professors, eat lots of junk food, and spend time away from their parents. This is every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dream experience. At the beginning of my @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choirmaster announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION2. I'm ecstatic, but I'm a very introverted person, and I know I don't have any friends in the choir. I can't walk either and am afraid I'll be left in the store because I can't open the door or they'll cross a corner without @CAPS5 into the street, thousands of other things that go through my mind. I was so terrified that I would part with one of my choir-partner friends @PERSON3 that I barely went. I wasn't quite sure how, but my mom convinced me that everything would be ok and I had nothing to fear. Once at @LOCATION2, we split into groups to see who wants to explore @PERSON7 and who wants to hit @ORGANIZATION2 Street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare has come true and I am separated from @LOCATION3. I'm trying to tell myself that nothing can go wrong and that my companions won't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I keep coming to the same conclusion: I'll be alone in a city of mine with a group of strangers Know nothing. Somehow, I got on a bus that slowly took me away from @LOCATION3. Another girl @PERSON4 came up to me and tried to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus trips of my life. When we got to the bottom of the @ORGANIZATION2 street, we split up again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill, the other was going to take an old trolley to the top and downhill. Mountains are not that steep. I was forced to take the tram because the hill was too steep, part of the sidewalk had steps, and I couldn't walk, the only option was the tram. Several other kids went with us and @PERSON4 was in my group again. A few hours later, after getting lost and taking a few wrong turns, we found the tram stop and bought tickets. Luckily, I've managed to avoid talking to @PERSON4, so the ride up the mountain was a pleasure. Some locals smiled at us as we were so happy to be on the tram. We saw houses, shops and @LOCATION1 on our trip. There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperones and four children. Once we got to the top, the two kids @PERSON6 and @PERSON5 decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperones @PERSON6 and @PERSON5 ran down the mountain to find a public toilet. This leaves me alone, with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, who are the remaining companions. We walked leisurely down the hill and @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 did most of the conversation. Every once in a while, they would ask me a question, which I would answer in as short a language as possible, which happened when we passed a group of men who were arguing in front of a store and one of them yelled: "@@ CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! What are you doing? Are you going to @CAPS7's house?" We don't really know who he's talking to or what he's talking about, so we just keep walking, but when we get to the end of the block At the end @PERSON4 I laughed at the same time. The man is talking about me. After going down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses and I should have said to the guy, each one was hilarious than the last and as the conversation went on we ended up on different topics which made me realize @PERSON4 and I do have a lot of similar characteristics. We all love musicals, we all love reading, and we all have annoying little brothers. Since that day, @PERSON4 and I have been great friends, and it's all because we took a moment to laugh together.
I believe that laughter brings many different people together. In my friendships with friends, we always laugh at the random, stupid things that happen to us every day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. The one time laughter helped me the most was in fourth grade. Fourth grade brought so many ups and downs, we never knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fights for the smallest reasons. This battle includes my best friend @PERSON2, and my neighbors @PERSON1, @PERSON3 and @PERSON4. We were all very close before this battle against my favorite sports @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Everyone has their own side, @PERSON4 is on @PERSON2's side and I am alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 are not on the side of anyone they just want us to get along with. This was the hardest for @DATE2 and me because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew this and couldn't believe we had a big fight. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 would hang out with the two of us whenever possible, but somehow @LOCATION1 and I don't seem to be like that. We all think @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 never hang out with us. Soon our teachers and student teachers were calling our parents to tell them about the struggle. I remember someone coming home crying every other day. Our parents meet with our teachers and principals to discuss how they can help us. They came to the conclusion that @PERSON2, @PERSON1 and I were going to meet an MP. On the other hand, @PERSON3 did not meet the MP. We found this out when our teacher announced this to the class. As @PERSON1 remembers, "That was the first time you and @PERSON2 really talked in a long time!" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 Or I remember saying it, but I think change has already begun. When we went to the counselor she was very nice and talked to us in a way that we were all comfortable with. She asked what we missed most about our friendship, and all three of us answered with a smile. We said we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked if we liked playing games when we were together in the past, and we said yes. She made us play games like Monopoly and it was really fun. At the end of the day, the three of us went back to the classroom smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom, everyone was surprised how well we actually got along. When I came home after school, my mother asked me how my tutoring was going. I laughed and said we all had a great time! The next day, the three of us went back to the president and played more games. At this conference, we will also write a paper on how this struggle has changed us. When we were done, we all read the paper to each other. All had the same message: I wish this never happened, I miss the laughter, and I will laugh for this fight in the future. For the most part, this information is very real. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. The reaction from most of our friends was shocking because they couldn't believe we had a fight or they just laughed at how stupid it was. Most of our friends asked what the moral of the story was and we just said "don't let any little things get in the way of your friendship and remember to have a good time laughing." For the most part, for this stupid Fighting and laughing has brought us all closer and brought us together. Now we have more and more things to laugh at. Every friendship has its ups and downs, followed by laughter or crying. In the end, the only way you and your friends can get closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment of change or second guess with your friends. They are always with you on the journey of life, and laughter is the key.
The benefits of laughter Laughter has always been an important part of my life. When you laugh, you are happy. Having fun will put you in a good mood. When my friends and I have an argument or disagreement, laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make bad situations slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits, like working your core and lungs. A mom of my best friend passed away recently before @CAPS1. Her name is @CAPS2. She is like my second mother for several reasons. I have known her for @NUM1 years and I even lived at her house for a while. She's basically a mother figure to me because I don't live with my biological mother. I see her almost every day because of my friend @PERSON1. He's @NUM2 and we hang out almost every day. I remember him calling me that morning to tell me his mother died on the floor of her bedroom. When I saw the ambulance lights, I ran as fast as I could. Another friend of mine @PERSON2 spent @TIME1 at @PERSON1's house when his mom passed away. When I got to @PERSON1's house he immediately started crying on my shoulder. It's wise not to try to make @PERSON1 laugh because nothing is really funny when a loved one dies. Over time @PERSON2, I started to figure out how to cheer up @LOCATION1. We want to take his attention away from his mother. Don't you know the best way is to laugh. I'm a joker in my circle of friends. So some I have the ability to make people laugh without thinking. I'm more of a doer than a thinker. I'd rather see my friend in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood, there is this bad vibe or vibe and you can feel it. It's a very unwelcome feeling. When my friends are down, laughter cheers them up. The laughter helped create a bad situation, like my friend's mom dying in a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter with trust and respect is what @CAPS3 brings me and my friends together.
@CAPS2 @CAPS1 The first time I heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was the beginning of my freshman year. I'm interested in this, but I'm not sure. Although in eighth grade, I played volleyball just for fun and really enjoyed it. After high school, I decided I wanted to play volleyball. But when I entered high school, my perception of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was a lot more than I expected, and people and I realized that if I was going to play on the high school volleyball team, I wasn't going to have any fun. So I started thinking about joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team. I finally decided to sign up for the team. I really hope I will love @CAPS2 @CAPS1 because this is my first year on the team and I have absolutely no idea what to expect. The first day of practice, after school I went into the girls' locker room, changed my clothes, took everything away, and went to the runway shed. When I left there, I saw a lot of people I had never seen before, except my grade-level kids and my best friend. My coach @PERSON1 started talking to all the newbies at @CAPS2 @CAPS1. She told us it was going to be a great experience, it was a great sport and it was more of an individual sport than a team sport. But we also do a lot as a team. After she talks and discusses the basics of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. We're going to jog warm-up laps and then stretch as a team. Then we start a day of running, each day is a different workout, whether it's a road run or a track workout. I'm starting to really enjoy @CAPS2 @CAPS1. At first, I was in so much pain that I couldn't move at all. But as the season really started, I finally got back in shape and looked forward to practicing every day after school. We were training and getting ready for my first game and it made me very nervous, I didn't know what was going to happen in my first game, I was very scared and nervous. But after that, I played my first game and I felt good and proud of myself. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is something I've loved since I started running in my freshman year. One of my favorite competitions I've been to is called "@CAPS5 @CAPS6". The first time I played that game was my freshman year, it was like our third or fourth game of the season. It also happens to be the first time we've played that game in a few years. So I'm excited because I've heard about it and everyone is telling me how exciting it will be and I'm going to love it, game day I'm as nervous again as any other game since I first joined @CAPS2 @CAPS1 , still. When we reached our destination, we set up our tent and started warming up for each of the upcoming men's and women's games. We also reviewed the course and that's when I realized everyone was telling me about mud puddles and a huge steep hill and we had to @CAPS2 a river twice. After the game, my team and I had a great time, I laughed and we all had a great time. Great fun, we rode the bus as a team, all the fun exercises. We enjoyed a lot of laughter and all the happy hours we had together as a team. @CAPS2 My favorite year @CAPS1 has to be my freshman year because it was my best season and I love it. We gradually fell in love and became a team. Laughter is a big part of @CAPS2 @CAPS1, we laugh and enjoy each other’s company while we practice, and the same goes for the bus ride on the way to the party. We had a lot of fun and had a lot of laughs as a team, which was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to build connections and friendships with everyone on the team. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is an important part of running, having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without it our team wouldn't be as happy, excited or even ready to practice. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 Great laugh, without it our team wouldn't be as happy as we have been all these years.
One of the strangest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things justice. @CAPS1 Most of what I see is laughing. There's also laughing when you don't really understand your boss jokes, and laughing when you're really doing it at the "right time" for you. @My favorite one CAPS1 laughing at your best friend when you cry. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw her friend sobbing how her boyfriend had just broken up with a lady. Quietly turning on my shoulders I try to hear more stories. Her friend nodded, comforting her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross he ate. Kind of like a cow eating grass. Once her friend said the girl blushed, she giggled. @CAPS1 is still her red eyes, she sniffs a little bit. @CAPS1 A slow smile rushed over her face. The woman had more smirks and then laughed out loud. @CAPS1 You can tell a girl is going to be okay because she has someone to make her laugh and remember life, not just one person. I thought for a second how it happened more then you think my best friend. I feel like even 7 years later, when we're out laughing is never out of date. Most of the time, it's some stupid thing, and we're just weird thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 And then there are other times when it's like the lady is behind me. One of us is upset that we know the perfect thing to say to the other. Friendship is just that. And laughter is medical for any problem. After looking at the two women, I put in front of what I now see a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps her skirt smooth again. Then the boy who kept shaking his knee took one down. You can tell him something he wants to try while he keeps taking a few quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about her being a girl and she would play football there. He looked at what she was pointing at and said he thought he might play baseball for a while. She nodded and they got silent again. The train came to its next stop and the little bit of tearjerker caused the boy to spill some of his water over his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissue out of her purse to give to their kids. His cheeks were flushed red, and he began to chuckle and explain how nervous he was, which wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and soon began to smile. Then they both started looking at each other and started laughing. The boy's laugh is deep and the whole train of girls is very contagious @CAPS1 sweet echoes. Now the ice has been broken because of an embarrassing moment that made them both talk and laugh. It is possible that maybe even young love begins. I laughed and rested my head window. Look blurred by trees. I know how our world always talks about such blues @CAPS1 I think people forget about moments like this. It's those brief seconds that another person is with you. Making you laugh and caring enough, trying to make you feel better, makes our world go completely crazy. The train slammed and began to slow as it stopped. I slouched my bag on my shoulder and got off. As I stepped out I felt the cold wind kiss my cheek. I looked around and saw people passing me rushing to find their next bus or person to pick them up. I sat on the bench watching teenage couples holding hands as they walked past me. Everything suddenly darkened due to their smiles and conversations. I put my hands and my eyes again big hands cold connection. I hunt around to see who has blinded me. This is my dad smiling from ear to ear. I got up on the bench and hugged him and I laughed. My laughter is high-pitched @CAPS1 stuffy in my dad's coat. This is the best type of laugh I have. No action is funny or friends say something @CAPS1 Because you are so happy, sometimes you have to give in a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because of your happiness. Then in the second everything that's bad or you stress about disappears. Maybe just a little while @CAPS1 it's still something that can keep you good all day.
How we all laugh now, all of us have probably laughed at least once in our lifetimes. But I've never laughed like the day my friends @CAPS1 and I were waiting for our friends @LOCATION1, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 to get @PERSON3 back from @LOCATION3 to hang out. @PERSON1 had to wait at my house for them to come back, in On the way to my house, I was wondering what the hell am I supposed to do with @CAPS1 alone? It's always fun to hang out with @PERSON1 but when we hang out we always have someone around, I expected @PERSON1 to be there because I can't think of what me and @PERSON1 could do In my house without @PERSON2 and @PERSON4. We couldn't hang out at home because my @CAPS3 had a cold so we had to walk outside to the store, also known as the garage, and hang out together until @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 finally showed up @NUM1 when she got there, I Not as disgusting as I thought, she got out of the car and came in, we went straight to the store and started trying to find something to do, @PERSON1 suggested we sit down and chat, as long as it's fun and doesn't involve a night at @NUM2:@NUM3 @CAPS4 Go anywhere, I can do anything. I sit there and ask her if she's happy with her life, she hates living in @LOCATION2 and a lot of other stuff. But then came the ultimate topic of conversation...a TV commercial. We discussed all of our favorite @CAPS5 ads and why they are our favorites, I told her my favorite ads are the ones from freecreditreport.com, the old ones are not new, the reason I like them so much is because of them There are real life situations that make it easy for them to believe, but they're also a little hard to believe because I don't know of anyone who has had to work in a restaurant because of identity theft, dressed up as a pirate, or someone because of a bad credit score. Not buying a very old car and a small car that I've never heard of used? Anyone @CAPS1 saying her favorite ad is a car ad with dancing hamsters telling you which car is the best option, @CAPS1 is describing the ad to me and actually starting dancing in the middle of my garage. It's funny, but also a little disturbing at the same time. @PERSON1 is a really good friend, even if she's a little silly at times, but the best thing about having @CAPS1 is knowing that when I need a real good friend, I have @CAPS1 After the whole dance I know what I want @CAPS1 there...I want to be crazy and super I want to be energetic and the fastest runners in the world won't be able to keep up with me! I walked into the kitchen, had some sugar, was as excited as @CAPS1, only less, and then time almost flew by before we knew @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 were there, and we couldn't believe it. @PERSON3 got out of the car and the first person he hugged was of course @PERSON1, then he gave me a hug, then @PERSON4, then @PERSON2. I haven't seen @PERSON3 in a long time, like we've never met before. @CAPS1 showed everyone her dance and song and everyone laughed so hard I thought they were going to pass out I had so much fun that night, mostly because @CAPS1 she was so nice and funny she made me Thinking about other things and then my thought at the time was that @CAPS1 was a super ball that night, which I thought was funny. We just stood in the shed and she "rat" and I jumped on the chair screaming "@CAPS14!" @CAPS1 reassured me it was in the rafters and couldn't come down to pick us up, so in the rest The time we just acted like he wasn't even there I was really lucky to have @CAPS1 and I'm really glad I was brave enough to go over and say hi to her that day in the art world because other sensible people got lost And @PERSON1 is the best friend a girl could ask for, and I'm lucky to have her as my best friend. She's smart, funny, and talented, and if she's gone, I'll miss her @CAPS17, really glad she moved here from Port Orford.
I live a life full of laughter and I can't think of a day where I haven't laughed. Even when I threw a little @DATE1 on the toughest day of my life, there was still a reason for someone to make me or laugh. I think laughter is a person's best medicine. If you are someone who can go a day without laughing, I would love to meet you and make a change! I remember a few special times when we were just full of laughter, mostly involving family and friends. The first one I remember was when my parents showed me a picture of me as a kid, and there was a lot of laughter when I was a kid. The photo they showed me was @DATE2 time, I wasn't wearing a shirt, just shorts. I was sitting on the sled facing uphill and the sun was just right. I can't explain how hard it is for me and my family to laugh just looking at a photo. The other laugh I remember is not when it happened, but when I look back now, all I can think of is, wow. I'm about six @DATE1 and have eight lamas at my best friend's house and they're tied up in the yard every day. The one I always have to walk is named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is sweet, @CAPS2 I am not, however, until the day @DATE2 she decides to drag me across the highway. When I'm on drugs on a usually busy highway, all I can do is people yell "Let go of her lead!" @CAPS2 When I was six I thought if I let go, the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regret not letting go because I got scratched and blistered by poison on the sidewalk. It was a time in my life that I will always look back on and laugh, but never forget. The last, favorite time of my life. It's pretty much any time I'm with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our first trip to the beach. We've never been there together, but, it was awesome! We tried to ride our bikes on the beach but failed and just laughed it off. Then we decided to walk around all the beach stores to see if we could find something we might want to buy. Later that day, we just went to the beach, took a walk, and felt great. The fun part of the trip was when we tried to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the sea behind us. People looked at us like we were crazy, but we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost all the time! I think laughter is a very important part of everyday life for everyone. If you don't laugh at least once a day, there is a problem. I love looking back at photos from my childhood, reminiscing with best friends and their animals, going on trips like @CAPS2, just with my boyfriend. Laughter helps me a lot in life because it lifts me up when I'm feeling down.
@CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS6 Is laughter frustrating when you can't make someone laugh? Is it really possible for @CAPS6 to be so angry that he can't even smile at all? There's something ridiculous in each case, and sometimes @CAPS6 just takes some thought and imagination to figure out what @CAPS6 is. I have personally had this experience where I can see the laughter in order to make me feel that everything is ok. Last time @DATE1, I was babysitting, it was a nice sunny day @CAPS6 and we were all craving chocolate frosting from @ORGANIZATION1. At the time I couldn't legally drive anyone other than my family, so we decided to call my sister @LOCATION1. She has a day off so @CAPS6 seems like the perfect day for frost. We've been waiting for @PERSON2 to arrive at the house and finally, about an hour later, she pulls up in the driveway. The kids are very excited. The four of us got into the back seat of @CAPS4 and we went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there we started getting off the car and that's when I realized something was wrong. @PERSON2 just locked the key in the car, the key is still in the ignition, the car is still running! I'm still getting the kids out of the car, so you'd think I'd reach for them, but no, that's not the case here. I asked @PERSON2 "@CAPS3 did you leave your car open? Aren't you going to get your keys?" @CAPS4 responded, "@CAPS5 no! I locked @CAPS6 too! Don't turn yours off Door!" @CAPS6 Too late. When I was done I instinctively closed the door. I didn't really think I could avoid all of this, especially considering I was the first to notice @CAPS6. Apparently after I asked them a question I didn't listen to them because the kids were pretty much rolling around on the floor because they laughed so hard I don't know what's funny. Then @CAPS6 hit me and I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION2 parking lot with our three kids, locked out of a moving car, and we didn't really know what to do from there. The first thing we did to fix this was to call my mom and have @CAPS4 bring a spare @CAPS1, but at the time we weren't sure where the spare @CAPS1 was. My mom said she didn't have @CAPS6 so we had to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS6 was. We called him and he laughed at us for being stupid and said @CAPS1 was in his truck and someone had to take @CAPS6 from him because he was going to a meeting. Apparently we couldn't get @CAPS6 from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS6, even though at this point she wasn't too happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us not to worry about this car, nothing will happen to @CAPS6, @CAPS6 is locked, then go into @PERSON1's and get our frost. With all this @PERSON2 I just want to keep the kids happy, but they don't really need us. They were busy playing my closing role and @PERSON2 said no. They think @CAPS6 is funny. @PERSON2 and I aren't that funny about @CAPS6, although we do think it's funny for @CAPS6 to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over. Instead of making children laugh, they make us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION2 for almost two hours before my mom showed up with @CAPS1. @CAPS6 Turns out @CAPS1 isn't on my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS6 is at our house, hanging off the board with all the other spare keys. But that doesn't matter, what matters is that before we let the kids go home, their moms are there where we're not. Sitting there in a car running out of gas and no one in the car is not the fun part of the day, and @PERSON2 didn't blame me for everything or let me fill @CAPS4 with all the money I made that day from babysitting tank. Fun for the kids. To this day, they are still laughing at our little @PERSON1's adventures. @CAPS6 just made me realize that all the kids of @CAPS6 brought laughter to the world and encouraged everyone to be happy. I'm sure everyone needs a little laugh in their day, even if they think @CAPS6 is the worst day ever. Laughter really @CAPS1.
Laughter is an important part of building friendships, relationships and partnerships. Laughing is the first thing you learn to do, you are born knowing how to laugh, it is the only thing you are born knowing how to do. For me, laughter is the beginning of a friendship, and if I can make other people laugh, we've been closer when we first said "@CAPS1." For example, when I started working in the nursery, I now make other teachers laugh, and you can tell it has a way to exclude you from the staff. On my first day at work, I walked into the day care center where they dropped me off in a preschool classroom. I'm pretty sure my boss can see that I'm nervous and it makes me laugh. It made me feel welcome, like we could be friends. What the kids in that classroom did make me laugh. Working with kids, you'll find out if you can make them laugh, or if you laugh at the jokes there, they'll be more inclined to trust you so you can make them feel comfortable around you. Sometimes it's hard to gain someone's trust, but if you get it from the start, it's easy to keep and easy to lose. When someone is in trouble, simply making them laugh can make everything hilarious like a drug to make you feel better, and nothing else will do. It's safe to say that it's natural to make people laugh because I'm so good at it and jokes are easy. Everything gets better when you laugh. Laughter is actually a form of health, a form of wandering. When I'm at work and my kids laugh, I feel better even after my worst day. I feel so much better about myself when I'm with happy people. It's even better when its babies laugh because they're so cute when they do.
Laughter, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on @CAPS3 @DATE1 @CAPS4 One of my favorite @DATE1 traditions is visiting our @CAPS2 house @CAPS5. They live on 80 acres of forest and meadows outside a quaint old town. Their tiny green house overlooks brown fields and blue ponds, with tall trees forming the backdrop. We arrive in the morning. We either found our @CAPS2 in the house or met them running out of the woods to meet us with shovels, chainsaws and other off-road tools in hand. After the customary hello, how are you, we often hang out in the yard marveling at new fruit trees or hearing stories about the aviary's newest tenant. On the hottest part of @CAPS4, we head to the shade of the lush @ORGANIZATION1 woods. A short walk will lead us to a trail. I love walking among sun-dappled ferns and fallen logs, treading cautiously over rickety bridges over rushing streams, bouncing confidently over sturdy new bridges, and walking in and out of the water as dogs go in and out Avoid them as much as possible. @PERSON2 knows the flora and fauna of the area, so we keep gaining knowledge as we hike. Of course, he also had to tell us about the trees he planted - a redwood here (look how good it is! It's been a foot since last fall!) and a Douglas fir over there (not so good .that big redwood is shading too much). One of the best parts of the hike was when we saw the cul-de-sac that my family helped build three years ago. We always go to the end of it and discuss where it can go from there - over the stream, or beside it, or up the hill, and if so, where is the turn? Can you really ride a trail like this? After the walk, we came home, sweaty and chatty. Then it's time to put on your swimsuit and jump into the pond! They recently built a jetty we could jump off - a huge improvement over wading from the edge. We spent most of @TIME1 swimming, running from one end of the pond to the other, splashing water on inner tubes and having pond weed throwing battles. Finally we got tired and sat by the pond to dry in the warm sun. By @TIME1, dinner is ready. Laura usually cooks salmon with tons of delicious side dishes. We dragged our chairs to the hill above the pond for a leisurely dinner. From the hill, we can see turtles and birds on the pond, bugs in the fields, and many more birds swooping in the air to feed on the aforementioned bugs. After dinner, we dragged chairs and plates back to the house and sat on the porch @TIME2. @PERSON2's favorite part of @CAPS4 is at dusk when the sun is at just the right angle and all the bugs are circling the sky. At one point, all the bugs came together to form a tornado, twisted upwards into the darkening sky, and then - they disappeared until the next @CAPS4. It was an incredible spectacle; thousands of tiny insects disappeared in an instant. The best thing these days is our friendship and camaraderie with this wonderful family. Parents have known each other long before our kids were born, so we have a lot to say; @PERSON2 is interested in science topics and always finds a way to tune up the latest articles he reads. And, like all the great @CAPS2, we keep laughing. I always hiccup at least 3 times when we're hanging out on the porch after our busy @CAPS4. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or @PERSON1 boy can make a joke, usually "politically incorrect" but always funny. Don't even get me started on my @DATE1 camping trip, winter ski trip or fall cider press with @CAPS5 right now.
Misunderstood "@CAPS1 this is her problem" was @CAPS1, I took a look and @CAPS7 gave me @CAPS15 the nasty look. @CAPS27 apparently thinks this new girl is weird. @CAPS7 @CAPS24 has @CAPS15 killer look in her eyes. I watched the way @CAPS7 glared at @CAPS27 in the room and how her facial expression never changed. "@CAPS2 hmmm," my cousin @PERSON1 asked, staring at @CAPS3, of course, she's the new girl. I looked at @CAPS3 and then at @LOCATION1. “@CAPS5 is on! @CAPS11 can say @CAPS26! @CAPS7 can’t hear us,” whispered @CAPS7. The whisper of @PERSON1 was not as quiet as @CAPS7 thought. @CAPS3 will probably hear everything we say. I took another look at her and found that behind those cold eyes, @CAPS7 seemed a little lonely and sad. I guess @CAPS26 is possible, @CAPS7 has been the talk of the entire @NUM1 grade class since @CAPS7 arrived about @NUM2 days ago. "Hi @CAPS6! Taylor? Is @CAPS11 there?" @CAPS7 is now in front of me and sees @CAPS3. "@CAPS7 does look like @CAPS2, but maybe @CAPS7 is actually a good guy," I said about @CAPS1, but I know @CAPS15 won't satisfy @PERSON1 at all. "@CAPS1? Absolutely not. Her parents should be mafia or something. @CAPS7 is that kind of temperament." "@CAPS11 shouldn't judge someone @CAPS31 for their looks," I replied. @PERSON1 gave me @CAPS15 a confusing look. “I mean, @CAPS11 will never know unless @CAPS11 asks.” “@CAPS12 If you’re an expert on @CAPS26 why don’t @CAPS11 have lunch with her and ask her.” @CAPS13 dude . There is @CAPS29 way I can do this. I know I @CAPS24 said not to judge someone @CAPS31 for their looks, but @CAPS7 looks like @CAPS7 will kick my calf if I open my mouth and talk to her. @CAPS1 is a dilemma @CAPS15. "Isn't @CAPS14 someone @CAPS11 wants to meet her? @CAPS11 asks." @CAPS15 won't @CAPS31 over @PERSON1 either. "@CAPS16? @CAPS29 way. We've decided @CAPS11 will ask. @CAPS11 can't @CAPS5 come back with the same thing," @CAPS7 argued. @PERSON1 is a stubborn girl, and while @CAPS7 likes to pick on me, @CAPS7 is a really nice guy. Also, despite her obnoxious appearance, @CAPS7 has many friends and is not shy like me. "@CAPS17," I muttered. I had to give in. @CAPS29 Question @CAPS1 I said, I will have to face @CAPS3. "I think that's @CAPS1. @CAPS26 is a great opportunity to make new friends. I'm @CAPS24 helping @CAPS11." @CAPS7 with @CAPS15's mischievous smile on her face. I took one last look at @CAPS3 and then at the clock. @CAPS26 @NUM3 in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I'm nearsighted, but lunch at @NUM4. I can't concentrate at all during class. I'm busy playing the scenarios that might come up at lunch. Maybe @CAPS7 isn't mean, maybe @CAPS7 is actually good, and people misunderstand @CAPS24, including me. Other than that, I don't even know what @CAPS1 can say; I can't just walk up to @CAPS24, sit in front of her, look her in the eyes, smile and say "@CAPS21. How about @CAPS11?" No way @CAPS24 Impossible, people should @CAPS24 in addition to @CAPS26, in fact @CAPS26 should actually be a fundamental law. I looked at the clock again, @CAPS26 is now @NUM5 and it's still ticking. "@NUM6 minutes," @PERSON1 said in some kind of singing. I sighed. "@CAPS22? I've been watching @CAPS11 in class. Looks like @CAPS11 will jump out of that window and run away at any moment." @CAPS7 laughed. My seat is the @CAPS31 window and I haven't forgotten this option. "I have @CAPS29 leads @CAPS1 I have to say," I said finally. "@CAPS24 say anything that doesn't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or @CAPS1 @CAPS7 hobbies. Even talk about school," @CAPS7 replied. "Time for @CAPS26. Let's go." @CAPS27 poured out of the classroom and into the cafeteria. After lunch, I started walking towards the table where @CAPS3 was; @CAPS29 one by her side, @CAPS29 surprise there. "@CAPS6, @ MONTH1 I'm sitting here," I asked. My voice trembled a little, I thought I was going to have a heart attack from my nervousness and surprise @CAPS1 @CAPS7 said. "@CAPS31 Anyway, go ahead," @CAPS7 laughed. Wow, @CAPS7 is really cute when she smiles. I smiled back and sat down. I created a conversation @CAPS31 introducing myself and asking how @CAPS7 is and how @CAPS7 likes the @CAPS15 school. What amazes me is that we actually have common interests and are united. @CAPS7 laughed. I am laughing. We laughed together. After that day, and to this day, we are still best friends. That kind of light laughter makes @CAPS24 miss it so much, @CAPS26 is indescribable. @CAPS24 Something as trivial as laughter, or even a little giggle, can bring anyone together into a simple bond, friendship. Laughter is really an essential part of life.
It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I think this knowledge is real. We've all laughed at some point in our lives, whether in a group or just laughing and having a @CAPS9 time. The reality is that we are all connected in a very simple way and we have all laughed in our lives. Laughter means something different for everyone. Laughing @CAPS15 might mean I'm happy and full of energy, while other times it might just mean I feel like I really don't know what @CAPS22 should do. Once though it means both. It was a cold and rainy day @DATE1 on @DATE2. I watch a movie with my friends. When I'm with my friends, it usually means we're talking about the latest thing, men, hair, whatever. "@CAPS1 OMG @PERSON3!" We heard @PERSON2 scream like @PERSON1 before I walked into my room. "@CAPS1 boy." I thought, "@CAPS3 we're @CAPS7 again. I'm new and it's wrong to have both of them @CAPS3." @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I'm new to her via @CAPS28 The brain has the same idea. "@CAPS4, @CAPS22 Happened this time?" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room, only to see the two of them bumping into each other, violently pulling each other's hair, and slapping each other, which @CAPS29 did before I lost it Everything imaginable. I hate seeing my friend @CAPS7 like @CAPS29. "@CAPS4!" I finally shouted. "@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're doing. You," I pointed to @PERSON3, "@CAPS7 sit there." @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. "@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14, can't you two just relax and enjoy this time like you two are friends? At least six hours left?" I looked at each of them, and @CAPS29 nodded in response . "@CAPS9, @CAPS14 let @CAPS7 do the rest of this movie, or play a quiet game." I sigh, hoping the worst is over. @PERSON3 went back to my room, lay on my bed, and we continued watching the movie in peace. "@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 is just a hilarious genius?" @PERSON2 said staring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28's eyes only seemed to rest on him. "@CAPS1 OMG @PERSON2!" @PERSON3 laughed. "@CAPS14 Who's calling someone crazy?" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 looked at each other and began to laugh nervously. The tension in the air was almost thick. @PERSON2 made the comment on @CAPS28 Gaming Faces. I leaned into @PERSON1 and whispered, "@CAPS1 this isn't going to be pretty." We started preparing for the worst. "@CAPS17 grabs @PERSON3's arm and drags @CAPS28 out of this room if necessary." @PERSON1 jumps to @CAPS 28 feet, takes @PERSON3 out of the room, just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 my bed. When @CAPS29 leaves and the door closes, I get @CAPS28 up but keep myself between @CAPS28 and the door. "@CAPS4, @CAPS22 Are you two playing?" I asked @CAPS28 nervously. @PERSON2 started laughing with an evil giggle that sent chills down my spine. I couldn't help but let out a horrified chuckle, which only affected the situation even more. This can only mean one thing, my original intention, not to invite any of them, has just been confirmed and we are taking it. I slowly started to step back and walk out of my room, seeing @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say because I never actually got anything from @LOCATION1. I took a breath and walked towards them. "What happened to @CAPS4 @CAPS22? You two have never fought such a big battle before." @CAPS20 started running down @CAPS28's cheeks like a stream running down a mountain. "I...I didn't know @CAPS22h...happened." @PERSON3 said still crying. "I j.. just wanted to ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha.. it happened today." That's what @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces look like, @CAPS22 happens to be we missed. "@CAPS22 Are you saying @CAPS22 happened today?" I asked. I was overwhelmed when she replied to @CAPS15 @CAPS28. "@CAPS23 is that all? You two are going to rip each other's hair out on a guy?" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. "@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3." All three of us went inside. I'm sitting on the bed next to @LOCATION1, with @PERSON1 protecting @PERSON3 in the middle. "@CAPS4, it doesn't make any sense. @CAPS23 y'all like the same guy. Big deal to get over it! @CAPS29 just complicates things anyway." I look at them both, @CAPS20 flowing from their rosy cheeks down. "@CAPS14 Can we forgive and forget?" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed creaking like hers. "I'm @CAPS23, sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?" @CAPS28 with tears and red eyes, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 in reply. "Of course I forgive you." @CAPS29 hugs @CAPS20 still down their faces. All is well again.
